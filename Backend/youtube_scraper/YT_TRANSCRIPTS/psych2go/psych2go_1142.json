    "transcript": "- [Narrator] We all\nknow that good parenting\ninvolves unconditional love and support.\nIt was even found that affection\ncan affect brain development.\nSo it's not just touchy-feely stuff.\nUnfortunately, not all parents provide\nthis kind of nurturing.\nInstead, they exhibit behaviors\nthat are downright toxic\nand sabotage the possibility of a healthy,\nfulfilling relationship\nwith their children.\nWondering what those things are?\nHere, let's take a look.\nNumber one, they project\ntheir negativity onto you.\nThis is when the parent\nplaces things they dislike\nor can't face about themselves\nonto their children,\nso instead of the parent saying,\n\"I'm disappointed in myself,\"\nthey persistently tell their\nchild that life is unfair,\nthat the child is unlucky,\nor maybe even tell the\nchild they're unworthy\nso they should expect to fail.\nThis is incredibly damaging\nas the child who is still developing\ntakes the parent's words as absolute truth\nand they'll start to embody\nthose negative projections.\nNumber two, they show\nlittle to no empathy.\nConsider if, when going to your parent\nfor help for a problem or in grief,\nyou hear something like,\n\"Why is everything always about you?\"\nor, \"No one ever cares about the parent.\n\"It's only your needs that\nare important, right?\"\nThe parent might even be\ndismissive of your concern\nand change the subject to\nsomething they deem important,\nmeaning something to fulfill\ntheir own needs, not yours.\nThey don't think, consider,\nor really care about how\nyou or other people feel.\nIt's all about them, and\nthe concept of other people\nhaving equally valid\nfeelings is incomprehensible.\nThis is terrible, as this\nsends a clear message\nthat they simply don't care\nfor the child as an individual.\nNumber three, they're overly critical.\nYes, we make mistakes\nand, yes, part of parenting\nis to make the child aware\nthat something is a\nmistake in the first place\nso they can learn.\nThere is a limit though,\nbefore it turns into abuse.\nOverly critical is when the child\nhas tried repeatedly to\ncorrect things or improve,\nyet they're still offensively wrong.\nAn example could be, \"You only got 80%.\n\"You were lazy and didn't study,\"\nwhich leads to, \"You only got 90%?\n\"Do I have an idiot for a child?\"\nAnd even at 100,\n\"What, the teacher\nfinally took pity on you?\"\nOr, \"So you got 100%, but\nyou neglected your chores.\n\"If you can't do both,\nyou're just useless.\"\nSo the child grows up believing\nthey're never good enough,\nmaybe they're defective\nor maybe they deserve to be treated badly.\nNumber four, despite\nknowing your boundaries,\nthey ignore them.\nEver been just relaxing\nquietly in your room\nand your parent just\nbarges in with no warning,\nor maybe our of the blue\nthey force advice on you\nabout something you never\neven hinted to them you needed\nor wanted help with?\nAnd if you dare to say something about it,\nyou likely get the,\n\"I'm the parent, so I have the right to.\"\nNo, this is ridiculous.\nUnless the child is so young\nthat they can't do basic\nfunctions for themselves yet,\nany healthy relationship must\ninclude personal boundaries\nthat are respected by all parties.\nA one-off could be that they didn't know\nor there was some sort of emergency.\nA repeated offense,\nespecially if some excuse of,\n\"Because I'm the parent,\" is given,\nmeans they don't respect you as a person\nand that is not healthy.\nNumber five, they insult you to hurt you.\nThis is different from a joke burn war\nwhere it's been firmly established by all\nthat it's a fake insult for humor.\nThis is the kind where\nyou're humiliated or shamed,\noften for no reason,\nor perhaps as a response to an\naccomplishment you've shared.\nThey might even do this in front of others\njust to dig even deeper.\nThis is not tough love to keep you humble.\nThis is flat out abuse that\nmakes the child feel alienated,\nanxious or depressed.\nThe child's whole future outlook\ncould be shackled with low self-esteem.\nNumber six, you are always the\nreason for anything negative,\neven if you're actually not.\nEver been blamed for being born?\nYou know, comments like,\n\"You ruined my life.\n\"I couldn't reach my goals\nbecause I had to raise you,\"\nor maybe somehow everything\nthat is inconvenient in\nyour life is your fault?\nLike you're some sort of\nsupernatural harbinger of doom,\naffecting events and places\nyou've never even seen.\nCommonsense goes out the window\nand they take everything\nthey're dissatisfied with\nand somehow make it your doing.\nWhich, by the way, is 99.99% impossible.\nIf you can relate to this, you\nhave dysfunctional parents.\nReally, it's them, not you.\nAnd number seven, they\nare all take and no give.\nWe don't mean things like money or gifts,\nalthough that could be part of it.\nThis is like those\nsituations where a parent,\ninstead of going to a qualified counselor\nor even an adult friend\ndecides to emotionally dump\non their 12 year old instead.\nAll the child knows is\nthat the parent is upset,\nso they try to comfort\nthem as best they can.\nA child is defined as a child here\nbecause their brains haven't\ndeveloped to maturity yet.\nThey should not and cannot handle\nthat kind of responsibility\nin a healthy way.\nIt's supposed to be the\nparent supporting, guiding,\nand comforting the child.\nMaking the child be the\nparent is a real phenomenon\ncalled, unsurprisingly, parentification\nand it also means that when\nthe child is in need of comfort\nthe parent doesn't reciprocate.\nHealing yourself from toxic\nparenting is in your power.\nYou, and only you,\nhave control of your own\nfeelings and attitudes.\nYour parents are, likewise,\nthe only ones who can control\nand change their own\nfeelings and attitudes.\nIt's time to free\nyourself from that burden\nif you believe it's your fault\nthey aren't being better\npeople, because it isn't.\nYou are never obligated to be abused,\nnor are you obligated to\ntake on your parents' issues\nthat they've ignored in themselves.\nLook our for yourself and be\nsomeone you like and respect.\nWe know you can do it.\nDid you recognize any of these signs?\nHas this video changed\nthe way you see things\nthat have happened in the past?\nPeople feel free to discuss\nbelow and we'll see you soon."
