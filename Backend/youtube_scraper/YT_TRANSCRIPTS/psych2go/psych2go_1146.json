    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2goers, welcome back.\nRelationships and how not to mess them up\nis, was, and will continue\nto be a relevant topic\nin all forms of media.\nWhen you look at the message\nthey're sending though,\none basic puerile concept shines through,\nreciprocal treatment.\nWe may have heard it called\n\"The Golden Rule\" as children\nand now hand wave it as adults thinking,\nof course, I know it.\nTaking a step back though,\nwe as a society seem to have\na surprisingly difficult time\ntruly enacting this practice,\nwhether it's from a lack of self-awareness\nor forgetting that your\ncommitted romantic partner\nis also your best friend.\nWe're gonna point out five habits\nthat are destructive to relationships.\nNumber one, the habit of ex-parison\nor comparing your partner\nto your past relationships.\nAs a general rule, it's\nconsidered poor taste\nand a weak argument to use\ncomparisons of people we know\nto pit one as better than the other.\nThis is most directly seen\nthe more emotionally involved we are,\nespecially past partners.\nComparisons in this\nscenario usually develop\ninto us making our subjective\nview as an absolute truth,\na black or white.\nUnless one is aiming\nto slide down the lane of being a zealot,\nwe're sure you can see how\nthis type of comparison\ncan be harmful.\nWe tend to forget\nthat just as no one person\nhas a 100% picture of you\nbecause only you have that,\nthe same goes for what we see in others.\nIn comparing the ex or the\nexes to your current partner,\nit demonstrates that the past relationship\nis taking up disproportionate\nimportance in your mind.\nThis could also present as mistrust\nin the current relationship,\nso as to use a past one as a baseline.\nIt can also show that there's no room\nfor getting to know someone new\nif you're trying to nudge the new person\ninto being someone else.\nWhat that partner sees and\nfeels is that they are no one,\nonly there to somehow clone\nor carry on the legacy\nof a past relationship.\nSince they feel that they\nsomehow aren't in a relationship\nbecause you actually want them,\nthey may quickly come to the conclusion\nthat there is no reason to stay.\nNumber two, the habit of complacency.\nDon't set it and forget it.\nThis usually happens\nafter the honeymoon period\nof the relationship.\nYou know, when the hormones cool\nand you no longer feel\nall neurons firing a hundred gun salute\nevery time the person calls you.\nThis is a bit of a tipping point\nwhere we have to actively and consciously\nmake maintenance efforts\nto the relationship.\n\"But I didn't have to\nthink about it before.\"\nWe know.\nThat was the infatuation phase\nwhen you not only had the\nsuper rush of hormones\nbut also weren't totally\nsure of the level of into you\nyour partner was.\nIt sounds like a big\ndeal, this maintenance,\nbut really it's just forming a good habit\ninstead of a bad one.\nThe habit of being complacent\nlooks like sweatpants 24-7,\nthe disappearance of date nights,\nand essentially choosing\nevery other activity\nover your partner\nbecause they'll be there.\nThe result is a partner\nwho feels taken for granted\nand shoved on a back burner.\nThe actions or inactions\nsend a message of \"This\nrelationship isn't my priority.\"\nA good habit is taking\nperiodic relationship checks\nlike check-ins.\nMaybe a surprise movie night.\nJust something to make sure\nyour partner understands\njust how important the\nrelationship is to you.\nNumber three, the habit of ego.\nThis relationship isn't just you.\nAn important aspect of\nrelationships is communication.\nCommunication is a two-way street.\nIt's not you talking about yourself\nand everything your partner\nsays is about you and for you.\nEmpathy is the key and vital role here.\nIn listening to your romantic partner\nyou're not only comprehending their words\nbut also feeling how they feel.\nThis means not automatically\njumping to the defensive\nbelieving this is them trying\nto lay the smackdown on you.\nIt's not about you.\nWhen you can empathize,\nyou communicate that you\nrespect and value their needs,\ncreating a safe space for them.\nThis allows them to\nopen up, be vulnerable,\nand thus deepen the relationship.\nNumber four, the habit of being a jerk.\nDon't be abusive.\nRemember that abuse is not only physical.\nBruises, cuts, and scars\ncan also be dealt with\nemotionally, psychologically,\nand verbally.\nAbuse of any sort acts\nlike a gangrenous cancer.\nIt weakens and rots an\naspect of the relationship\nand spreads until total destruction\nand decomposition are accomplished.\nTying into the previous point,\neven if you think of it as a joke,\ntake a moment to consider\nif this is really hurting your partner.\nSo, calling your partner\nnames or belittling them\nmight make you feel like\nyou're being fun and laid back,\nbut it's really crushing the\ncommunication between you both.\nIt also breaks down the respect\nand subsequently the trust\nyou have towards each other.\nThe widening gap this drives between you\nleads to no longer feeling the need\nto carry on the relationship.\nAnd number five, the habit of infidelity.\nDon't cheat.\nAll right, you can stop\nsaying \"Derp, that's obvious.\"\nWe all know the words\nand we all know the logic\nand yet it happens so much.\nOne wonders if we as\npeople even get it anymore.\nRelationships rely on trust and love.\nCheating is the clearest\nbreaking of that trust.\nCheating means that you and\nyour partner had an agreement,\na bond, and an emotional contract\nthat was just incinerated by the cheater.\nIt's also not always as simple\nas \"I kissed someone else.\"\nEvery relationship has its own agreements,\nregardless of type.\nYou knowingly break that\nagreement and you've cheated.\nThis can even include\npurposefully omitting information\nbecause you know that the\ntenet of the relationship\nis being breached by that info.\nThis habit denotes that\nthere is a lack of trust\nor an insecurity\nand sooner or later it tears\nthe relationship apart.\nDid you relate to any of these habits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nMaintaining a relationship sounds easy,\nyet, always remember that\nthe best things are the best\nbecause we put effort into them.\nSometimes the greatest effort\nis looking at one's self and being honest.\nWe have faith that you\nwill do what is right\nfor you and your loved one.\nAnd if it's worth it, work it.\nThanks for watching\nand we'll catch you next time.\n(soft music)"
