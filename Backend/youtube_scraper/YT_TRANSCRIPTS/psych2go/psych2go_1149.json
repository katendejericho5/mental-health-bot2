    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Ever heard of\nthe term toxic positivity?\nSounds oxymoronic, yet\nit's there, it happens,\nand no, you're not being ungrateful.\nThese seemingly harmless phrases\nprobably come from a\nplace of good intention,\nbut no matter how someone intends it,\nthey still tend to come off\nas indifference or condescension.\nNot only that, but\nthey're also usually said,\nwhen you're already\nfeeling kind of crappy,\nthis is not good.\nSo whether you're worried\nabout being the one saying it,\nor you're wondering why you feel bad\nabout someone else saying these to you,\nlet's look at these seemingly harmless,\nyet toxic phrases.\nNumber one, it's not the worst\nthing that can happen to you.\nWow, that stung,\nthis phrase carries the implication\nthat you're ungrateful or weak.\nIt indirectly adds shame and guilt\nto the person who is already suffering.\nPain is subjective and\nrelative to each person.\nSo comparing it or trying to top it\nis not helpful in the least.\nEven though what someone is going through\ncould seem minor to you,\nthat same issue could\nbe a colossal obstacle\nfor someone else.\nNumber two, I told you so.\nWe all know it can be tempting\nbut we also know fully how painful it is\nto deal with someone\nwho's gloating over us\nwith I told you so,\nespecially when we've gone\nthrough the painful step\nof admitting we're wrong\nand are now going through\nthe equally painful task\nof righting that wrong.\nNo matter how much insistence there is\nthat the phrase is being said\nto educate for the future\nor to show you care,\nit only sends a message\nthat you can't be trusted or confided in,\nas a mistake means\nhumiliation and condescension.\nNumber three, it's nothing,\ndon't worry about it.\nSimilar to the first phrase,\nsaying something is\nnothing is not helpful.\nWe understand that it's meant\nto give a wider perspective.\nAs in, in the grand scheme of things,\nwhat has happened is not\ngoing to derail everything.\nSo you're okay and can move past this.\nHowever, since it's such\na short and abrupt phrase,\nwhat comes through is\nwhat you do and what you\nfeel are unimportant.\nYou don't matter.\nOuch.\nNumber four, you're\nstrong, you can handle it.\nWell, it depends on the context.\nBut if this phrase is given,\nwhen a person has\nexpressed a vulnerability\nor a pain point like grieving,\nthey're looking to you for help, support,\nmaybe even a solution,\nthey feel weak and making\nthe decision to ask you\nwas already difficult.\nSimply telling them the\nopposite, you're strong,\nyou can handle it, is\nthe equivalent of saying\nI reject this weakness you're showing,\nI refuse your request for help,\ndeal with it on your own.\nThis rejection of them,\nwhen they've opened up,\ncarries the message that\nbeing vulnerable is wrong\nand they must hide themselves.\nNumber five, you're in trouble.\nThis is toxic when it's said,\nwhen the person already knows\nthat they're in for some bad times,\nlike after crashing their friend's car,\nor missing an important deadline.\nIn other words, thanks, Captain Obvious,\nyou're not helping.\nA phrase like this during\na highly stressful event\ncan also sound like you're\ntaking sadistic glee\nin their misfortune.\nIf this trouble was told\nin confidence to you,\nmeaning the person needs\nat least a sympathetic ear,\nthis phrase sounds almost\nlike a betrayal of trust.\nAnd they may think twice\nabout opening up to you\nin the future about anything.\nNumber six, time heals everything.\nThis one comes off sounding\nlike a disinterested,\nlazy or meaningless platitude.\nIt's right up there with\nthis two shall pass, or\ntime heals all wounds.\nIt sounds like something someone says\nso they don't have to deal with\nthe person with the problems anymore.\nWhen someone is in the\ndeepest part of grief\nor in the depths of intense emotion,\nthis phrase sounds flaky and unreal.\nIt also sounds like a lie.\nTime isn't Wolverine's healing factor.\nTime is what allows a\nperson to adapt, process,\nand cool down from the\npeak intensity of emotions.\nThat's it.\nProfound things will always\nleave a mark, barring amnesia.\nGenerally, we know we're\njust trying to help,\nand we say these things\nbecause we feel the need to\ncontribute and support somehow.\nCaring is good and necessary.\nTo make those efforts more effective,\nwe need to be aware of\nhow our words come across.\nOur vocabulary can be improved\nby being rooted in realism and the now,\ninstead of an idealized future.\nWhen we better utilize our\nwords to comfort others,\nwe also do so for ourselves.\nThanks for watching and good on you\nfor wanting to be better for others.\nDid any of these phrases\ntweak something in you?\nFeel free to add, share,\nand discuss in the comments.\nSee you soon."
