    "transcript": "- [Amanda Silvera] There\nhas been a huge decline\nin mental health around the world,\nwhich is why we're so committed\nto creating more content\nthan we ever have.\nThanks for being a part of our journey.\nDo you think you grew up\nin a healthy environment?\nYour childhood is supposed\nto be the time of joy,\nhappiness and growth\nwhere you learn about the\nworld through your experiences,\nwith your parents and\nthe people around you.\nBut unfortunately, some\npeople don't experience\nthe blessing of living\nin a happy household.\nIf you were neglected or abused as a kid,\nyou probably suffer the\nconsequences of it to this day\nwithout knowing how toxic\nyour situation really was.\nYou may have come to believe\nthat it's just how families work\nand bring your learned\nfeelings of shame, fear,\nand sadness into adulthood.\nTo learn more about this,\nhere are five signs you\nhad a traumatic childhood.\nNumber one, childless reactions.\nHow do you cope with stress?\nWhile children cry and throw tantrums\nto relieve their frustrations,\nit would be a bit odd to see\nan adult angrily stomp their feet\nin the middle of a long\nand boring meeting.\nThis is why adults need\nto handle their problems\nin a different, more mature way.\nBut if you've suffered trauma as a child,\nyou might find yourself\ndrifting off to simpler times\nwhen life gets too hard to handle.\nThis is called age regression,\na coping mechanism\nin which your behavior\ntemporarily reverses\nto earlier stages of development.\nSo when faced with stress, you\nmay turn to using baby talk,\nthrowing tantrums, rocking,\nor pacing to soothe yourself\nor using dolls or stuffed\nanimals for support.\nSome extreme cases of age\nregression can include\ncrying in a fetal position or bedwetting.\nNumber two, insecure attachment.\nIn psychology, the theory\nof attachment refers to\nhow our ideas about\nrelationships are learned\nthrough our interactions with\nour parents or caregivers.\nGrowing up with a secure attachment meant\nthat your parents had fulfilled your needs\nwhen you were a baby\nand you gained a positive self-image\nand learned to trust those around you.\nBut with an insecure attachment,\nyour caregivers may have been\nso unresponsive or neglectful\nthat your brain decided that\nothers could not be trusted.\nAnd you ended up developing\na negative self-image,\nwhich can follow you into adulthood.\nAs a result, you may struggle to form\nor maintain close relationships\nbecause you experience intense\nfeelings of abandonment\nor the fear of commitment.\nNumber three, conflict avoidance.\nWere you allowed to stand up for yourself\nwhen you felt you needed to,\nor did your parents always just dismiss\nyour thoughts and ideas?\nGrowing up in a dismissive\nor overly critical environment\ncould have taught you\nto expect negative reactions\nfrom the people around you\nand cause you to be\nafraid of confrontation.\nWhether it's with your\npartner, family member,\nwork colleague, or friend,\nyou may find that you can't\nreally voice your opinions\nand will always let them\nhave things their way.\nEven when things upset you,\nyou may just choose to change the topic,\npretend you're okay,\nor even force yourself to stay\nin an uncomfortable situation\njust so you don't have\nto disappoint anyone.\nNumber four, low self-worth.\nDid your parents praise\nyou for your achievements,\nor did they brush them off\nlike they didn't happen?\nWere they gentle with their criticisms,\nor did they humiliate you\nwhen you did something wrong?\nIf you were constantly criticized\nfor everything you did,\nno matter how small or\ninsignificant it was,\nyou may come to believe\nthat you're worthless\nand can't do anything right.\nThese feelings may continue into adulthood\nwhere even if you were\ntold you did a good job,\nyou still think it wasn't\ndone right or well enough.\nIt's as if you're never\ngood enough for others\nor for yourself\nand live in a constant state of anxiety,\nwondering what others think of you\nor whether they approve of you or not.\nIn number five, risky behavior.\nLastly, another possible\nsign of childhood trauma is\nif you engage in lots of risky behavior.\nRisky behavior describes any behavior\nwith an uncertain risk,\nwhether binge drinking, taking drugs,\nreckless driving, and so on.\nStudies have shown that\nexposure to traumatic events\nand the development of PTSD\nsymptoms can make you seek\nthese behaviors more frequently.\nAlso seeking risk may be\na maladaptive strategy\nto help you overcome\nall those negative\nfeelings you experienced\nwhen you were a child.\nEven if you don't see it as a big deal,\nrisking your life and health is\ncertainly a cause for concern.\nDo you think you had\na traumatic childhood,\nlet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those
