    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have trouble paying attention?\nFor example, zoning out\nwhile watching this video?\nDo you think you have\nADHD because of this?\nOftentimes, people mistake\nsymptoms of anxiety as ADHD\nbecause of some of the\nsimilar traits they share.\nAccording to the Centers\nfor Disease Control\nand Prevention data,\nabout 3 in 10 children\nwith ADHD have anxiety.\nSo to help you get a better understanding\nof the difference\nbetween ADHD and anxiety,\nhere are six signs to look out for.\nNumber one, you have poor focus\nbecause of worrying thoughts.\nAre you always distracted by your worries,\nso much so that you're unable to focus\non the things you're doing?\nWhen fear and apprehension\ndominate your thoughts,\nit may cause you to become restless,\nhave trouble with sitting\nstill, paying attention,\nor staying focused in class.\nAccording to John Waldrop, MD\nfrom Weill Cornell Medical College,\nwhen you experience anxiety,\nyour prefrontal cortex,\nthe part of the brain which is essential\nfor thinking, learning, and\nremembering, is shut down.\nYour brain is concentrated\non staying safe.\nIn contrast with ADHD,\nyou aren't consumed by worrying thoughts.\nInstead, it has more\nto do with an imbalance\nin your hormones: dopamine\nand norepinephrine,\nwhich causes you to be distracted.\nNumber two, you don't tend to have\nas many problems with impulsivity.\nDo you often find yourself\nspeaking out loud in class\nwithout raising your hand?\nPerhaps you were even labeled\nas the troublemaker in school\nbecause of the way you\ncan never sit still.\nAccording to Dr. John, a\nperson with ADHD may feel\nas if there are dozens of controllers\ntrying to control their\nbrain at the same time\nwithout checking in with each other first.\nSo if you find that you\ndon't appear to have\nas many problems with impulsivity\nbut just struggle to speak up or stand up\nbecause of your nerves,\nhen you may have anxiety rather than ADHD.\nNumber three, you have trouble\ncompleting your schoolwork\nbecause of perfectionism.\nDo you have trouble\ncompleting your schoolwork?\nPerhaps you find yourself procrastinating\neven if you only have just\none assignment to you.\nThis struggle could be because\nyou have so many points\nyou wanna make in so many\nways to phrase the words\nthat it leaves you wanting\nto throw up your hands\nand ignore them.\nYou're avoiding starting your assignments\nbecause you can't have\nit be less than perfect.\nIf you can relate to this,\nthen it's more likely you're struggling\nwith anxiety and not ADHD.\nDr. John stated that\nwhile people with ADHD\nmay experience difficulty\ncompleting their schoolwork\nor performing tasks,\nit's often due to trouble\nwith concentration\nrather than perfectionism.\nNumber four, you are\ngenerally more sensitive\nto social cues.\nAre you very sensitive\nto how you come across to other people?\nDo you find yourself often uncomfortable\nwith your social environment?\nPerhaps you find it challenging to eat\nin front of other people,\nor tend to avoid speaking in public\nbecause of an overwhelming fear\nthat people will judge you negatively.\nAccording to Dr. John,\nif your answers are yes\nto the above questions,\nit's more likely that you\nhave anxiety rather than ADHD.\nThis is because people\nwith ADHD usually struggle\nwith understanding or missing social cues\nrather than being hypersensitive to them.\nNumber five, you experience\na racing heart, clamminess,\ntense muscles, headaches,\nnausea, or dizziness.\nDo you often experience\nheadaches, nausea, or dizziness?\nThese are just some of\nthe symptoms of anxiety.\nDr. John stated that anxiety comes\nfrom a tiny almond-shaped part\nat the back of your brain\ncalled the amygdala.\nAs a watchman for your brain,\nit is constantly watching out for danger.\nAnd whenever it detects danger,\nit triggers a fight or flight response.\nHowever, for people who are anxious,\nthe amygdala is large and hypersensitive.\nBecause of this,\nit ends up sending out\na lot of false alarms.\nYou can think of it as a watchman\nwho cries wolf too often.\nAs a result, your brain may sense threats\neven in non-threatening situations.\nAnd number six, you are unlikely\nto show problem behaviors\nwhen you're feeling calm, safe,\nand doing things you enjoy.\nHow do you act when you're having fun?\nWhether it's listening\nto your favorite music\nor playing video games, you\nmay find yourself feeling calm\nand safe while doing the things\nthat you genuinely enjoy.\nYou are neither restless\nnor feeling like you need\nto catch your breath.\nAccording to Dr. John, anxious\nindividuals are unlikely\nto display any problem behaviors\nwhen feeling calm and safe\nand doing something they enjoy.\nOn the contrary, people with ADHD\nwill experience problem behaviors\neven when they engage in a particular fun\nor exciting activity.\nFor example, a person with ADHD\nmay become so engrossed\nwith painting a picture\nthat they tune out or completely\nignore everything else.\nThis behavior is known as hyperfocus.\nDid you relate to any of\nthe signs we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this
