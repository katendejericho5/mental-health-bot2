    "transcript": "- [Woman] Hey friends,\nwelcome back to another video.\nIs there someone trying to manipulate you\nevery time you talk?\nThey just gotta have it their\nway, no matter what it takes\nand maybe you are aware\nit's all manipulation,\nbut you still can't help but get angry.\nAnd you wish you had a come back\nfor their manipulative tactics.\nWell if you wanna stop that\nmaster manipulator once\nand for all, keep watching\nfor some powerful comebacks.\nNumber one, no, you probably\nalready heard the expression,\n\"No is a full sentence.\"\nEven though sometimes you\nwanna explain the reasons\nfor rejecting someone like when talking\nto a friend or a family member,\nyou don't need to justify\nyourself to anyone,\nno matter how hard a manipulator tries\nto make you do things their way.\nYou have the right to refuse\nto do anything you are\nnot comfortable with.\nDon't be afraid to say no and turn away.\nThey really aren't\nworthy of an explanation.\nNumber two, I don't\ncare about your opinion.\nManipulators usually take\ngreat pride in themselves\nand believe their opinions\nare the only right opinions.\nAnd they try to make you believe the same.\nAnd since they're the\nmasters of manipulation,\nmost of the time, they manage\nto push those opinions on others.\nBut when you tell them you\ndon't care about their opinion,\nsuddenly their tactics fail.\nThey can't believe someone doesn't care\nabout their cherished opinion.\nIf you use this comeback,\nyou might get a confused\nexpression and a minute of silence.\nNumber three, I feel sorry for you.\nIt's not uncommon\nfor a manipulator to\nthink they are superior\nand they believe that\neveryone else thinks the same.\nThey think you'll believe\nanything they say simply\nbecause they're so great and important\nand they expect admiration.\nSo telling them you feel sorry\nfor them could be quite shocking to them.\nBonus points if you explain\nwhy you feel sorry for them,\nthey're just a sad, lonely\nperson trying desperately\nto convince themselves\nthat others like them.\nNumber four, I don't have time for this\nbecause who does have time\nfor being manipulated?\nMaster manipulators\nfeel the need to control\nand dominate everyone and everything,\nwhich also includes your time.\nThey think they have the right\nto always be in your face\nwith their tactics and demands.\nSo tell them straightforwardly\nthat there are\nso many things that are more important\nfor you than they are.\nLet them know you're not available\nand that you refuse to spend\neven one minute listening\nto what they have to say.\nAnd number five, don't talk to me.\nWhat better way to stop a manipulator than\nto not even engage in a conversation.\nSometimes that can even be the\nonly choice you're left with.\nOf course, this comeback\nmay not work instantly.\nEven if you try to shut them down,\nthey will probably\ncontinue their mind games.\nSo that's where you need\nto show them that you really\nmean it by walking away\nfrom them or simply ignoring them\nas if they're not there.\nThis may seem petty at\nfirst, but your mental health\nand dignity is more\nimportant than their ego.\nTell them you don't\nwant them to talk to you\nand after that, make your\nactions speak even louder.\nSaying those things\nto such a dominating\npersonality can feel scary\nand you might be afraid of\ntheir reaction and anger,\nbut refusing to let them hold any power\nover you is the most important\nstep to free yourself\nfrom their manipulative grasp.\nWhen you show them that\nyou are not as weak\nas they think you are, they\ncan't see you as their prey.\nSo take a stand for yourself\nand don't be afraid of anyone.\nHave you had experiences\nwith a manipulator?\nLet us know in the comments\nand share this video with\nanyone who may benefit.\nAs always, the references\nand studies used are listed\nin the description.\nUntil next time and thanks for watching.\nTake care."
