    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nAmerican novelist Thomas Wolf once said,\n\"Loneliness is and always\nhas been the central and inevitable\nexperience of every man.\"\nAnd most of us would probably agree\nbecause we've all felt loneliness\nat some point in our lives.\nSo if you are struggling right now\nwith a deep loneliness in life\nthen you'll probably relate\nto these seven telltale signs.\nNumber one, you feel numb all the time.\nLately, whatever emotions\nyou used to feel a lot,\nbe it happiness, sadness,\nexcitement, interest\nor amusement, just don't\nseem to be there anymore.\nAnd nothing you do to cheer yourself\nup or make yourself feel something,\nagain, seems to be working.\nMost days, you just feel\nempty, lost and confused.\nYou're numb and emotionally detached\nbecause you're struggling\nwith a deep sense\nof loneliness that you\ndon't know how to deal with.\nNumber two, you can't\ncontrol your emotions.\nOn the rare instances,\nwhen you do manage to\nfeel something again,\nit's not much better\nbecause you can't seem\nto control your emotions.\nNow you get upset over\nthe tiniest inconvenience\nand suddenly don't know how to stop crying\nor lash out at the people around\nyou for no apparent reason.\nUnable to control your anger.\nPsychologists call this\nemotional volatility.\nAnd it's very common in people\nwho suffer from depression\nsevere anxiety and loneliness.\nNumber three, you feel\nlike you are too different\nfrom other people.\nEven around your closest\nfriends and family,\nyou still feel like an outsider.\nLike nobody really knows\nor understands you.\nYou struggle to connect\nwith others and you feel you don't belong.\nThis is because all too often\nour loneliness can\ndrive a wedge between us\nand everyone around us,\nblinding us from their warmth\nfriendship and compassion\nuntil all we're left\nwith is this nagging fear\nthat we're too different\nfor anyone to ever accept\nus for who we really are.\nNumber four, you question the\nmeaning and purpose of life.\nSome people tend to\nbecome more introspective\nand philosophical when they feel lonely.\nSo if you found yourself\nquestioning the meaning and purpose\nof life lately, this\nmight be the reason why.\nSometimes we might try to\nconfront our loneliness head\non and dive deeper into\nour own psyche to get\nto the root of it all.\nRegardless of whatever it is\nyou might find there in your\ninnermost thoughts, fears\nand desires, your more than likely to come\nout on the other side, a\nwiser more insightful person\nwith a new perspective on life.\nNumber five, you are always exhausted.\nAnother warning sign\nthat you might already\nbe feeling a deep loneliness\nwithout even realizing it\nis if you find yourself\nalways feeling exhausted.\nIt's like all of a sudden,\neven the simplest tasks\nlike returning a phone call,\ngoing out to buy groceries\nor cooking yourself a\nmeal seem too overwhelming\nand tiring to do.\nYou tread your feet all day long\nputting things off for as long as you can,\nonly to collapse on your bed exhausted\nand completely spent every night,\nwhich brings us to our next point.\nNumber six, you waste\nyour time doing nothing,\nmindlessly scrolling through\nsocial media, spending hours\nplaying video games, watching\nshows you don't even like,\ngossiping, gambling, partying, drinking\novereating, oversleeping, overspending.\nAll your time has been\nconsumed with these activities.\nAnd sure they might be fun and\neven relaxing in moderation,\nbut indulging in them too much will only\nleave you feeling lonelier than ever.\nWhy?\nBecause while all these things might seem\nlike a good way to distract us\nfrom our loneliness and make\nus feel good about ourselves,\nat the end of the day,\nit'll only remind us\nthat we don't feel like we're\ndoing anything worthwhile\nwith ourselves or our lives.\nAnd number seven, you stop\ntaking care of yourself.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly\nthe moment you start to\nneglect your own needs\nand stop taking care of\nyourself is a trouble sign\nthat your mental health is\ntaking a turn for the worst.\nHave you stopped brushing your teeth\nor combining your hair lately?\nDo you no longer do the\nthings you used to enjoy\nlike going out with friends\nor indulging in hobbies?\nDo you go for days without taking a shower\nor constantly leave your room in a mess?\nAll of these things\nare common side effects\nwhen we struggle with a\ndeep sense of loneliness\nin our lives.\nWe feel helpless and unfulfilled\nstarved of meaning, connection,\nintimacy and purpose.\nSo we just stop taking care\nof ourselves altogether because\nwe feel like it's pointless.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nHave you personally experienced\na deep sense of loneliness?\nIf you are struggling\nwith your mental health\nthe best thing you can do\nfor yourself is seek help\nand reach out to a mental\nhealthcare professional today.\nJust the fact that you're aware\nthat there is something\nmissing in your life shows\nthat you have a good idea of\nwho you are and what you want,\neven if you can't clearly\ndefine it just yet.\nTake this as a call to action\nto start soul searching and rediscover\nwhat makes life meaningful for you?\nWhat's your experience with loneliness?\nTalk about it in the comments below.\nDon't forget to leave a\nlike and share this video\nwith a friend who may find\nsome insight in it too.\nAs usual, all references used are added\nin the description below.\nSee you next time.\nTake care.\n(inspirational music)"
