behaviors that kill\nrelationships\nnumber one\nangrily reacting to criticism\nsometimes we feel the need to criticize\nthe people we spend time with\nthat critique doesn't need to be\nanything serious but the fact is we\ndon't like everything about people 100\nof the time\nso chances are your partner will\nsometimes criticize you too\nthe way you handle that criticism is a\nkey to a healthy relationship\ndo you get offended and give them the\nsilent treatment\ndo you turn it around against them\ndo you get angry and yell at them\nall of these behaviors could damage your\nrelationship in the long run it would\nsend a message to your partner that\nyou're not open for communication and\naccepting your own mistakes\ninstead try to think about what your\npartner said and why\ntake it as something that your partner\nfinds important and try to find a\nsolution together\nnumber two\ndisrespecting your partner's privacy\neven if you're a couple you're still an\nindividual\nas an individual you want to have your\nown private space for things you enjoy\nas a person\nyour partner deserves that space too\nproblems can arise if you overstep their\nboundaries this could mean going through\ntheir phone demanding to see their\nmessages or call logs\nnot allowing them to see friends or\nfamily and demanding you go out with\nthem every time everywhere this could\nmake your partner feel suffocated and\nlose a sense of individuality it could\nfeel like you're controlling them and\nbecome unhappy in a\nrelationship if you feel this behavior\nis common for you it's likely there are\nsome complex emotions underneath those\nactions\nfeelings of inadequacy low self-esteem\nand attachment issues working out these\nproblems in therapy could help you and\nyour relationship number three\nbringing yourself down\neven if you have a loving partner by\nyour side sometimes you may get\noverwhelmed with feelings of insecurity\nit happens to many of us and it is\ntotally okay to have

frustrated that they\ncan't help you with your self-image\ninsecurity could lead to other behaviors\nlike jealousy over analyzing your\npartner's words and needing constant\nreassurance this could drain the energy\nfrom both of you and damage the\nrelationship\nnumber four\ngiving ultimatums\nsometimes giving an ultimatum is the\nonly option you're left with to get the\ndesired outcome or change someone's bad\nbehavior\nfor example if their behavior is putting\nyou in a dangerous situation\nbut for non-harmful mundane situations\nopt for a conversation rather than an\nultimatum\nwhen you give an ultimatum you're trying\nto manipulate a person into doing what\nyou want\nyou may say something like if you go out\nwith that friend i don't like i'll break\nup with you\nwith this you're putting them in a\nposition where they're forced into a\ncorner they have to choose between two\npeople they love\nsince they are pressured into doing\nsomething they don't want to do your\npartner could start feeling resentment\ntowards you it could affect their\nself-esteem and destroy the trust you've\nbuilt over time and consequently hurt\nyour relationship\nand number five\ngiving the silent treatment\nhave you ever had an argument with your\npartner where you needed space\nafterwards\nit's okay to spend time alone to clear\nyour head until you're ready to talk it\nout\nthe silent treatment is different from\nthis\nwhile giving the silent treatment you're\nrefusing to talk about a problem\nignoring your partner and avoiding open\ncommunication\ngiving them the silent treatment instead\nof expressing your worries may act as a\nway for you to avoid taking\nresponsibility if you know you're in the\nwrong and it could also help you escape\nacknowledging or changing your behavior\na partner who is on the receiving end of\nthe silent treatment may feel confused\nignored hurt angry unloved or\nunimportant\nthey're left with no way to explain\nthemselves offer an apology or find a\ncompromise\nin the long run this could make their\nfeelings for you disappear\nand bring your relationship to the end\ndid you recognize some of these\nbehaviors in yourself\nif so it's okay as long as you're open\nto hearing it acknowledging it and\nchanging it\nnobody is perfect and nobody can expect\nyou to be perfect\nthe beauty of being in a relationship\nafter all is to be able to grow and\nchange for the better\none next to another\nand while you both work on yourselves\nyour bond will grow stronger than ever\ndid this video provide some insight let\nus know in the comments
