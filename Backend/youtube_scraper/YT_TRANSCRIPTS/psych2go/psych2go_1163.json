    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Go,\nhave you been feeling\na little stuck lately?\nIt's completely understandable if you are.\nIt seems like taking care\nof our mental health has never been harder\nthan in the last few years.\nIn times like these you may\nwish you had some magical powers\nto bring some light into your life,\nbut would you believe us if we told\nyou that you do have those powers in you.\nIt takes the form of a small\nsimple habit that could\nchange your life forever.\nIt's called gratitude.\nAnd if you keep watching\nyou'll see why it's a magical power.\nSo what is gratitude?\nGratitude is an emotion\nthat involves being thankful\nand appreciative of\nthings that surround you.\nIt stems from the recognition\nthat something good happens to you.\nYou can be grateful for\nexperiences that happen,\nthings that you own, people\nthat are in your life and so on.\nBy being grateful for something\nyou're actively acknowledging\nthe good in your life.\nThis is sometimes hard for many people,\nbecause we often get overwhelmed\nwith the challenges that\nlife puts in front of us.\nWe get blinded by our negative emotions\nand fail to see the positive side of life.\nBy practicing gratitude\nyou are able to make a much needed shift\nfrom that negativity.\nIt may seem like you have to suppress\nyour worries to be grateful\nbut that's not the case at all.\nA healthy mind recognizes\nand accepts the struggles\nbut it doesn't make\nthe struggles its home.\nIn other words, by being grateful\nyou're able to achieve more balance\nand make the good more important to you.\nSo how does it work?\nLet's take a dive into\nyour brain for a moment\nwhile looking at a simple analogy.\nTry to remember a route\nthat you are often taking.\nIt could be a path\nfrom your home to school\nor work, for example.\nThe first few times you took that route\neverything was new and unfamiliar,\nbut as time went by\nand you learned the way\nyou started moving almost automatically.\nYou didn't have to think\nabout directions or landmarks.\nYou just went straight ahead\nand in no time you\nreached your destination.\nYour brain also has pathways that go\nfrom point A to point B.\nThese points represent\ndifferent brain structures\nthat are in charge of different functions\nof your thoughts, emotions, and behavior.\nWhen you think about something\noften you are walking a certain\npathway again and again,\nand your brain is getting familiar\nwith the route of that thought.\nAt the same time\nwhen you want to shift\nyour way of thinking,\nyour brain faces some problems\nbecause it doesn't spend much\ntime traveling those routes.\nIf you spend too much time\nthinking negative thoughts,\nyour brain becomes very good\nat taking you to negative places,\nbecause it's learned that\nroute very efficiently.\nBut if you decide to make a change\nand try to go on a\ndifferent positive path,\nyou're helping your brain\nlearn that new route.\nThose new routes take you\nto certain brain structures\nthat are responsible for positive thoughts\nand that's how gratitude works.\nWhen you make it a habit\nto shift your point of view\nyou will be more likely to go\nto those positive places\nwhen things get hard.\nBecause your brain will\ntake you there on its own.\nNumber three, what are\nthe benefits of gratitude?\nWhen you're grateful you're acknowledging\nsomeone's act as meaningful.\nYou're thanking the other person\nfor whatever you're receiving from them.\nThis helps your relationship flourish\nand it strengthens your connections\nwith the people around you.\nIt can also show others\nthat you're not the one to\ntake things for granted.\nOn top of that, researchers have found\nmany physical and emotional\nbenefits of gratitude.\nIt's been shown that being grateful\nis associated with better physical health,\nlife satisfaction, hope and\npersonal growth, self esteem,\nquality of sleep, happiness and wellbeing.\nSo how do I make it a habit?\nWell, it's been said, that it\ntakes 21 days to form a habit.\nSo starting today and for the next 21 days\ntry keeping a gratitude journal.\nOf course you could just\nspend some time every day\nthinking about it,\nbut writing it down could ensure\nyou don't forget to do it.\nAnd you'll have it all\nin one place to reread\nwhen you feel like you need to.\nEvery night before you go to\nsleep or whichever time of day\nyou feel like it,\ntake out your journal and\nwrite down three things\nthat you're grateful for.\nSome days you'll have\na bunch to write about\nand some days you may find it hard.\nYou may think this day was horrible,\nhow do I find anything to be grateful for?\nBut that's exactly the point.\nThere is always something\nto be grateful for\nno matter how bad our days get.\nAre you grateful to have\na roof above your head?\nAre you grateful for the\nclothes that keep you warm?\nAre you grateful to have\naccess to the internet?\nAs we said before,\nit's not about ignoring the\nreal struggles of our lives.\nYou are allowed to have\na bad day or feel sad,\nbut the world is not\nstrictly black or white\nand your gratitude\njournal is here to remind\nyou that there is a spark\nof light even on rainy days,\nyou just have to be open to see it.\nSo do you think you'll\ntry out this simple habit?\nExpressing gratitude\nand reminding yourself\nof the good is something\nsmall that will work wonders\nif you're consistent with it.\nSo what's something you are grateful for?\nLeave a comment to\nshare with other viewers\nand the Psych2Go team.\nDid you enjoy this video?\nIf so don't forget to leave a like\nand a comment about your own experiences.\nShare this video with a friend\nif you think it'll help
