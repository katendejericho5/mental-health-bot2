    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nIs there someone you feel\na deep connection with?\nPerhaps their presence\nbrings you joy, peace,\nand a sense of security.\nWhether it's a platonic\nor romantic relationship,\nthere are certain healthy habits\nyou, your friend, or\nyour partner may practice\nthat can help strengthen\nyour bond and connection,\nand make it of very\nsuccessful relationship.\nYou may even be already communicating\nyour love and appreciation\nto each other in multiple ways\nwithout even realizing it.\nWanna know how to improve\nyour relationship,\nor whether or not\nyour relationship is a healthy one?\nHere are seven signs\nof a successful relationship.\nNumber one, you and your partner\ncan resolve conflicts.\nWhat do you do when you\ndisagree with your partner?\nFights are a normal part\nof any successful relationship.\nEveryone has different perspectives,\nand sometimes those perspectives\ncan conflict with one another.\nHowever, according to psychologists\nand relationship expert, John Gottman,\na hallmark sign of a healthy relationship\nis knowing how to recover\nfrom these disagreements.\nSo it's okay\nif you feel frustrated with your partner,\nlike you may never come to terms\nwith them about something.\nBut what's important is the way\nyou two approach this conflict.\nBy listening to one another,\nbeing open for a transparent conversation\nwhile respecting each other's ideas,\nyou can come out of\nconflict stronger than ever\nand feel even more connected\nwith each other than before.\nNumber two, you know how to compromise.\nIs there one person more\ndominating than the other\nin your relationship?\nFrom what restaurant you want to eat at\nto how many children you want together.\nYour relationship with someone\nwill likely consist\nof a lot of decision making as a pair.\nSure, you can follow your friend's lead\nand have sushi with her on Wednesday.\nBut on Thursday,\nit's your turn to pick.\nLearning how to make decisions together\ninvolves listening to\neach other's opinions\nand making compromises.\nWith that said,\nit's also important to be mindful\nif you feel that one side of the party\nis making too many compromises.\nBalance is the ultimate key\nto a successful relationship.\nNumber three, you have\nunconditional love for one another.\nUnconditional love outlines a type of love\nthat does not include what ifs.\nFor example, ideas like,\n\"I'll love him\n\"only if he buys me flowers every day,\"\nor, \"Our relationship would be great\n\"only if this happens.\"\nIt may call for an unstable relationship.\nWouldn't you feel more at peace\nif your partner loves you\nfor your entire self\nrather than certain aspects of you?\nWe as humans not only seek love,\nbut also security.\nPortraying an unconditional love\nfor each other\ncreates a sense of stability and trust.\nMaking the relationship long lasting\nand as wholesome as possible.\nNumber four, you can trust one another.\nDo you hide things from your partner?\nKeeping major secrets\nfrom one another\ncan grow into catastrophes.\nThis doesn't mean you must sacrifice\nthe occasional surprise\nbirthday party or gifts.\nBut if you find yourself\noften hiding your emotions\nand true thoughts from one another,\nthen maybe it's time to sit down\nand have a deep conversation.\nAfter all, trust involves\nhonesty and transparency.\nKnowing that they won't lie to you,\nand won't try to hurt you\nphysically or emotionally,\nand that you won't do the same\nis important in making the relationship\na safe and happy place.\nNumber five, you're kind to each other.\nNothing makes the relationship stronger\nthan treating each other\nwith empathy, respect, kindness,\nconsideration, and appreciation.\nIf you find yourself treating\nacquaintances and strangers\nwith more respect than you do\nyour partner, friend, family\nor someone you feel close with,\nperhaps it's good to take a step back\nand reevaluate who you prioritize.\nIf your relationship with someone\nbuilds on depreciating jokes\nor lighthearted goofiness,\nthat's fine too.\nAs long as you can show\nyour genuine appreciation\nfor them once in a while.\nSo the next time you see them,\ntry to shower them with compliments\nor make a gesture of kindness.\nYou may just make their day.\nNumber six, you see comfort\nin your relationship.\nHave you ever felt the urge\nto be with someone\nwhen you encounter a stressful situation?\nWhether your social battery\nhas been drained after a night out\nor you've been feeling anxious\nabout an upcoming exam,\nyou may experience a desire\nto be with a certain individual\nand seek comfort in them.\nIf that is the case,\nit means you have a very strong\nbond with this person\nand that your relationship with them\nhas become a safety net.\nA place you can call home\nand recharge whenever you feel down.\nAfter all, a successful relationship\noffers comfort to both parties,\neven in the most distressing situations.\nAnd number seven, you can be independent.\nDo you have your own time and space?\nWhile spending time with one another\ncan certainly improve your relationship,\nit's also important to be able\nto spend some time apart.\nHaving friends, personal, and hobbies\nmakes you a more complete person\nand a better partner.\nIt's understandable if you wanna be\nwith another person 24/7,\nbut please be mindful\nof their interests and state of mind.\nPsychologist Eli Finkel recommends\nlooking for hobbies and\nactivities on your own\ninstead of relying\non your partner or friend\nfor all of your existential needs.\nUltimately, wouldn't it be nice\nto have experiences\nto share when you reunite with each other\nat the end of the day?\nDid you relate to any\nof these signs we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share
