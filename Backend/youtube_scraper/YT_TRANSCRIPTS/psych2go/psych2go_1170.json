    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Ooh, wow.\nDo you remember your last crush?\nMaybe you have a crush right now.\nThey can fill you with both the elation\nwhen you see them or a nervous anxiety.\nWhatever the right words are\nto describe how they make you feel,\none thing is for certain.\nWhat your crush does or says\ncarries serious emotional weight with you.\nSince there's so much\nemotional investment,\nsometimes even the most confident of us\nhave insecurities and don't seize the day\nwhen the opportunity presents itself.\nEven worse is when those insecurities\nactively push this person away.\nAnd we may not even know it.\nGive me a break, right?\n\"We're already nervous,\"\nso let us help you out.\nHere are a few actions you may not realize\nare pushing your crush away.\nNumber one, ignoring them.\nSounds counterintuitive, right?\nIf you like someone, why\nwould you ice them out?\nPerhaps on the surface,\nyou justify it as playing hard to get,\nbut underneath, you are really trying\nto protect yourself from a rejection\nyou've convinced yourself\nis going to happen.\nIf your insecurity is screaming,\n\"They would never like the real you,\"\nyou can figure if you're crush sees you,\nthey can't hurt you.\nHold up, this isn't good.\nHave you ever been hurt\nor upset by someone who\nseems to be dodging you\nat every corner or ignoring you,\neven when they're right next to you?\nIt's like being ghosted to your face.\nThis is what you're doing to your crush.\nLeaving them constantly hanging\nor pretending they don't exist\ncan be rather harmful\nand may give them trust\nissues in the future.\nTrust us, you are not invisible.\nIt is likely they notice\nthe in-person ghosting,\nthey don't have a reason for it,\nso they're deeply disturbed as to why\nthis person seems to despise them.\nIf you've ever been ignored yourself,\nyou understand how much this hurts.\nSo you now have the power\nto stop hurting someone else.\nWe're not saying that you\nhave to glomp onto them\nwith romantic poetry in hand\nthe next time you see them,\nbut all it takes is being friendly\nand open to getting to know them\nso you can let them know how you feel.\nNumber two, nagging and insulting them.\nSo a piece of advice,\ndon't listen to those pick-up artist tips.\nEspecially ignore the one about negging,\nwhere something specific to the person\nis negated or insulted.\nThe reason often given is that either\nthis will make you look superior\nso the other person will want you more.\nOr for defense, through\npreemptive attacking.\nWe don't know about you,\nbut this sounds a lot more\nlike one person making an effort\nto hurt the other person.\nThe insults are emotionally\nand mentally scarring the individual.\nKnowing this, is the belief\nthat you're protecting yourself from hurt\nthat may or may not even happen\na truly justifiable\nreason for traumatizing\nthe very person you like?\nEngaging in insults is perpetuating\npatterns of abuse that continue to hurt\nnot only others but yourself as well.\nIt might be confusing if your crush\nand their friends insult\neach other to bond,\nbut they have an understanding\nof where the line is\nand connect differently to them than you.\nStarting with kindness and respect\nis always a good way to\ntake that step forward\nto developing a bond\nand understanding where the line is.\nNumber three, deflecting their advances.\nYou're not playing tennis.\nIf your crush compliments\nyou or makes advances\nand do you respond with an overhead smash,\nthey're not gonna return the volley.\nThis is a game, set, match,\nwhere your win might actually be a loss.\nWe get it.\nWhat if it's scary or\nyou feel not quite ready\nfor them to get close to you?\nThat's still no reason to deflect\ntheir actions hurtfully.\nIf the deflection is rough,\nthey can feel belittled.\nWorse, you could come off\nas condescending and cruel.\nSo you'd be sabotaging yourself.\nTo avoid this damage,\nyou could try simply meeting them halfway.\nInstead of knocking away their offer\nof how they think or feel,\nmake a matching offer of your own.\nYou can give your own perspective\nand make clear what your intentions\nor feelings are.\nNumber four, teasing too much.\nAh, yes, the magical concept of balance\nis at play here.\nTeasing can be fun,\nand it's not unusual to\ntease those you like.\nIf it's light and good-natured,\nit can help relieve tension,\nshow you're comfortable\nand confident around your crush\nand even open up conversation.\nThere's always a point of too much though,\nand then it gets ugly.\nExercise that self-awareness\nand looking at the situation as a whole.\nIf there's been too much\nor an overload of teasing,\nit becomes annoying, or worse, bullying.\nIf you're not careful\nor so wrapped up in teasing,\nyou may land on a subject\nthat is sensitive to your crush.\nAnd if you're always teasing and joking,\nthe other person feels they don't know you\nbecause nothing you do or say\nseems to be taken seriously.\nA sense of humor is great,\nbut successful teasing requires empathy\nso that it doesn't morph into humiliation\nor being demeaning.\nA healthy relationship\nrequires all parties within\nto have some reasonable\nlevel of self-confidence,\nas the previous points have shown\nhow overwhelming insecurities\ncan torpedo the whole thing.\nIn the end, why wouldn't you\ngive yourself the best chance possible\nto get to know this person\nyou've been crushing on?\nCommunicate and take the time\nto get to know them.\nYou might even find out\nyou don't have a crush\non them anymore after this.\nHave you noticed yourself\nor someone else doing any of these signs\nstated in this video?\nDo you have a crush right now\nand kinda wanna say something?\nFeel free to comment below\nand give us a like.\nCatch you next time."
