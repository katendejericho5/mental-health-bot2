    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you think\nthat beauty is the only thing\nthat makes people attractive?\nFor a lot of us,\nit takes more than a pretty face\nor dashing good looks to win us over.\nIt takes a kind heart, a beautiful mind,\nand a genuine soul to make\nus fall in love with someone.\nBut while we are admiring\nthese qualities in others,\nwe may end up forgetting that\nwe have these qualities too.\nWe can oftentimes be unaware or dismissive\nof all of our best traits and qualities.\nTo remind you that you're beautiful,\nhere are eight attractive\nthings you might be doing,\nbut don't notice.\nNumber one, you smile a lot.\nDo people see you as a\nwarm and friendly person?\nAre you always quick with a smile\nor a hello to brighten someone's day?\nWhile it might not seem like much to you,\nthat smile can catch other people's eyes\nand put them in a good mood.\nIt makes a good impression,\nand it shows other people\nthat you are a happy person\nwho finds joy in everyday things.\nAnd what's more attractive\nthan someone who has a\npositive, inviting energy?\nNumber two. You take\ncare of your appearance.\nEven if you might not be the best dressed\nor best looking person you know,\nwhat matters most to other people\nis that you take care of your appearance.\nIt's the little things\nthat make a big difference,\nlike freshly manicured nails,\na well-put-together outfit\nor a neat and tidy hairstyle,\nbecause it's not about how trendy\nor expensive your clothes are\nor about what brands you're wearing.\nWhat people find attractive\nis the way you carry yourself\nwith poise, confidence, and good grooming.\nNumber three, you talk about your hobbies.\nDo you have a hobby that you love\nor a favorite pastime you\ntalk about with your friends?\nWhether it's gardening,\ngaming, designing, painting\nreading, music, dancing,\nor playing sports,\npeople will always find\nyou more attractive\nwhen you have something\nyou're passionate about\nand which you're not afraid to share.\nSo keep this in mind\nnext time you wanna impress your crush.\nIt probably won't take much more\nthan being your genuine and true self,\nwhich includes talking to\nthem about your hobbies\nand favorite things to do.\nNumber four, you think before you speak.\nThere are few things that\nmake someone more unattractive\nthan being a gossip\nand getting your foot stuck in your mouth.\nImagine the person you've\nadmired from afar for so long\nfinally strikes up a conversation with you\nand you end up saying something stupid.\nIt can be a real turnoff sometimes.\nPeople who are careful to\nthink before they speak,\non the other hand, come off as\nmore intelligent, mysterious,\nsensitive, and sophisticated.\nYou say just enough to\npique their interest.\nSo they'll want to engage more with you.\nNumber five, you're a good listener.\nSimilar to the last point,\nbeing a good listener is a quality\na lot of people find attractive,\nespecially in a world where it seems like\neveryone is always trying to give\ntheir two cents about everything.\nThere's something nice and refreshing\nabout someone who doesn't\njust listen to respond\nor who isn't just waiting\nfor their turn to talk.\nBeing a good listener\nmakes the people you're\ntalking to feel more validated,\nappreciated, and attended to.\nIt shows them that unlike\na lot of people out there,\nyou're not just preoccupied with yourself\nbut care about other people too.\nYou are a giving and empathetic person,\nand this can make you more\nattractive than you think.\nNumber six, you easily make friends.\nAnother thing you may do\nthat you might not realize\nmakes you more attractive to other people\nis your easy ability to\nconverse and make friends.\nAfter all, who wouldn't\nbe attracted to someone\nwho makes everyone else\njust naturally gravitate towards them.\nWarm, friendly, and\neasy to get along with,\npeople will no doubt\nfind you more attractive\nthe more likable you make yourself seem.\nNumber seven, you take care of others.\nAre you always there for\npeople you care about?\nA true and generous friend,\nyou take care of your friends\nwhen they're not feeling well,\ncheer them up when they're down,\nand support them through everything.\nLoyalty like that is hard to come by.\nAnd that's what makes you so attractive.\nYou give so much of yourself,\nyour time, energy, and attention\nso freely that the people\naround you can't help\nbut feel lucky to know you\nand have you in their lives.\nAnd number eight, you compliment others.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nthere's nothing more attractive\nthan someone who makes other\npeople feel attractive too.\nSaying kind words and giving compliments\ncan warm everyone's\nhearts, and lets them know\nthat they can always turn to\nyou for comfort or support\nwhen the going gets tough.\nAnd you know what's\nmost attractive of all?\nThat you don't buy into the misguided idea\nthat we should all be\ncompeting with each other\nand that you need to\npush other people down\njust to raise yourself up.\nSo kindness is by far the most\nattractive quality of all.\nHave you started to realize\nthat you are more\nattractive than you think?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go post a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching and\nsee you in our next video."
