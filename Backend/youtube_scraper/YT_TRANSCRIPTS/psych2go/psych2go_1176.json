    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey there\nPsych2Goers and welcome back.\nAccording to a report published\nby the Centers for Disease\nControl and Prevention,\n7% of children aged three\nto 17 have been diagnosed\nwith anxiety disorders.\nThe types of anxiety which\nare commonly experienced\nby children include specific phobias\nor are more broad-based\nsuch as separation anxiety,\nsocial anxiety, and\ngeneralized anxiety disorder.\nWant to know the signs\nthat someone may have\ngrown up with anxiety?\nLet's delve into them together.\nNumber one, you live in\na chaotic environment.\nWhat exactly does a dysfunctional\nfamily environment entail?\nDoes this increase\nsusceptibility to anxiety?\nChildren crave a sense of belonging.\nA dysfunctional family impedes that need\nwith a perpetual absence of support,\nblocking a child's\nintegration with family.\nYou're faced with multiple\nforms of aggression or neglect,\nsuch as being belittled,\ndominated, lied to\nand controlled by your caregivers.\nThere's limited affection\nin the way of physical and\nverbal affirmations of love,\nempathy, and time spent together.\nNeglect and discord around\nother family members\nalways keeps you on edge.\nThe emotionally unstable and\nuntrustworthy environment\ncauses children to develop\ncertain defense strategies\nto maintain their safety\nand keep themselves intact.\nHowever, prolonged use\nof this defense strategy\nin the face of overwhelming\nstressors for far too long,\nmay pave the way to develop\nsevere forms of anxiety.\nNumber two, constant worry\nand negative thoughts\nhave been the norm.\nWould you call yourself a chronic worrier?\nDo you always report being tense\nand finding it hard to\nrelax and switch off?\nIt's actually normal to\nworry from time to time.\nPerhaps you're worried about\nthings like your health,\nfinance or some family issues,\nbut when anxiety is\nthe monster under your\nbed for a long, long time,\nand you find it difficult to fall asleep\nand stay asleep throughout the night\ndue to your noisy brain,\nthat's when your worry becomes\nexcessive and uncontrollable.\nEven when there's little\nor no reason for it to.\nThis may indicate an increased chance\nthat you may have anxiety\nor more specifically,\ngeneralized anxiety disorder.\nNumber three, you always\nfind it hard to concentrate.\nDoes your mind always tend\nto wander to the future?\nAnd you have to always ask your friends\nto repeat what they're saying.\nThis might be due\nto your having developed\nepisodic foresight.\nThis is defined as the mental construction\nof potential events\nand the ability to\nflexibly organize action\nin light of such anticipations.\nWhen you've been faced with\nanxiety for a long time,\nyou tend to think fast forward.\nYou're constantly on the\nlookout trying to foresee events\nand so have fallen into the habit\nof preventing the next possible mishap.\nYou tend to ruminate on minuscule details\nuntil they become the\nelephant in the room.\nMaking careful preparation for threats,\nopportunities and circumstances\nto control important\naspects of the future.\nNumber four, you have\nissues of separation.\nThrow back to the first day of school.\nDo you remember all those\ncrying and wailing little faces,\nor maybe you too?\nIt's actually a normal\nstage in development\nand helps children\nunderstand relationships\nand master their environments.\nBut separation anxiety is\na whole other phenomenon.\nThis term refers to excessive fear\nor worry about separation from\nhome or an attachment figure.\nWhen a child turns two years old\nseparation anxiety will normally end\nas they start to realize\nthat the attachment figure\nmay be out of sight now,\nbut will return later.\nThis situation dissipates\nwith the developmental\ngrowth of the child,\nbut when this level of anxiety\nsurpasses the developmental years,\nit's most probably\nseparation anxiety disorder.\nBeing reluctant to sleep without\nbeing near a major attachment figure,\nrefusing to attend camp\nor have a sleep over at a friend's home,\nor even needing someone to be with them\nwhen they go to another\nroom in their house\nare some ways this can manifest,\nas opposed to other peers of the same age.\nNumber five, you\nexperience bodily symptoms.\nJust before entering the stage\ndo you complain of tummy aches, nausea,\nand your muscles becoming tense?\nOr maybe you sweat profusely\nbefore a presentation.\nAll this is regarded as\nnormal and novel circumstance,\nbut when such physical reactions\nconstitute a major part of\nall your daily activities,\nit could be a nod towards\na highly anxious self.\nThose growing up with anxiety\ncan have trouble toggling\ntheir flight or flight state.\nYour body is ready to cry wolf\nat the slightest sign of distress.\nTheir heightened vigilance\nis quick to translate\ninto physical symptoms,\nsuch as stomach pain,\nnausea, or digestive trouble.\nInsomnia, weakness, or fatigue,\nand shortness of breath are\ncommon experiences as well.\nAnd number six, you are always tired.\nDid you just wake up from\na good eight hour sleep,\nbut still feel very exhausted?\nWhat? Yeah.\nAre you tired all the time,\nlacking the energy and\nmotivation to do anything?\nI feel you.\nIt's actually a very\nhuman thing to be tired\nand experience some form of fatigue,\nespecially after doing\ncertain strenuous activities.\nHowever, for people who\ngrew up with anxiety,\neven a small and simple act,\nsuch as making a cup of tea can\nfeel like a mental struggle.\nAnxiety pushes your body\nto be in survival mode\nall the time.\nYou are highly alert all the time\nand your body is flooded with energy,\ncausing a strain on\nyour adrenaline supply.\nThis condition is known as adrenal fatigue\ncausing you to feel drained.\nSo, do any of these\ndescribe your experience?\nPlease feel free to share any\nthoughts you have as well.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with those out\nthere with similar experiences.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos\nand as always, thanks for watching."
