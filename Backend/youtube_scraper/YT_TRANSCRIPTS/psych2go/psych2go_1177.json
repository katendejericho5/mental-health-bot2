    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey there, Psych2Goers.\nHave you been overwhelmed\nwith stress lately?\nLike, the kind of stress\nthat's adding and adding up,\ngetting ready to explode?\nThis feeling could be a warning sign\nof an impending mental\nor nervous breakdown.\nThis is a scary experience\nthat makes it impossible\nfor you to cope and function\nin your everyday life.\nSo to help you identify\nsome of these warnings,\nhere are eight early\nsigns to look out for.\nNumber one, you are more irritable.\nAre you finding that you are\non your last nerve lately?\nWhen you are on the verge\nof a nervous breakdown,\neven small things like someone\nbeing a little too late\nor walking a little too slow\ncan put you over the edge.\nThis can happen even if\nyou're not a hotheaded person.\nSuddenly, you just can't help yourself\nbut to feel intense anger\nat everyone and everything.\nNumber two, you worry about everything.\nIs your mind just cluttered\nwith worries about everything?\nWhen you are nearing a mental breakdown,\nyou may notice that your\nanxiety is off the rails.\nWhile it's normal to worry\nabout things now and then,\nit becomes a problem if you're finding\nthat you worry from sunrise to sunset,\nor that it's affecting your ability\nto do the things you love.\nThis can quickly become a cycle\nthat spirals out of control.\nNumber three, you withdraw\nfrom friends and family.\nWhen stress eats you up,\ntalking to someone you trust\nis a good self-care strategy,\nbut oftentimes, it just\nseems too difficult\nto hang out with anyone.\nYou may start to feel\nlike all you wanna do\nis get away from people\nand spend as much time\nas you can alone in your bed.\nTalking to others may\nmake you feel exhausted,\nand you may keep canceling plans,\nmaking up excuses for staying home.\nOr just plainly ignoring anyone\nwho tries to talk to you.\nThis is a sign that you're\nreaching your breaking point,\nand the isolation may\nfurther add to your problems.\nNumber four, your appetite has changed.\nFeeling intense stress\ncan change your appetite.\nAre you noticing that you\nare forgetting to eat,\nor when you do eat,\nthat it makes you feel\nsick to your stomach?\nOr, are you finding that\nyou're not interested,\nand things just don't seem to\ntaste as good as it once did?\nOr on the other hand, you\nmay indulge in overeating\nas a way to cope with stress.\nYou may crave food that\nyou know is unhealthy\nmore than you usual.\nWhile your eating habits\ncan have drastic impacts\non your physical health,\nit also affects your\nmental health as well.\nNumber five, you sleep\ntoo much or too little.\nHow have you been sleeping lately?\nDo you have trouble\nfalling or staying asleep?\nOr maybe your sleeping more than usual?\nInsomnia is another common\nsymptom of mental breakdown.\nDifficulty falling asleep\nor waking up several times\nduring the night is not only frustrating,\nbut it can also worsen\nyour other symptoms.\nOn the other hand, sleeping too much,\nknown as hypersomnia, can\nalso be a problem as well.\nDespite those extra hours,\nyou may find that you're\nstill feeling sluggish.\nSleep, like most things\nin life, needs a balance.\nNumber six, you're finding it difficult\nto focus and remember.\nHave you noticed that you\nare blinking out more?\nMaybe you're always looking for your keys\nand can never remember the\ntime of your next appointment.\nDo you also find it hard to focus?\nYou try to work or\nlisten to someone speak,\nbut your mind is wandering.\nLong-term stress can impact\nyour brain's physical structure.\nThe stress hormone,\ncortisol, that your brain\nhas too much during this\ntime makes it difficult\nfor you to stay on top of your game.\nIf left unchecked, it can\nincrease these problems later.\nNumber seven, you're losing\nyour energy and motivation.\nWhen you take all the not sleeping,\nnot eating and excessive\nworrying into account,\nyou might feel like you're\ndriving on an empty tank.\nYou may find that it's harder and harder\nto find the point in doing anything,\nwhich kills your motivation.\nFatigue can make it difficult\nfor you to function normally,\ndropping your quality of life.\nThis excessive tiredness\ncan be an early sign\nof a mental breakdown, and\none of the more severe ones.\nAnd number eight, you\nhave difficulty breathing.\nAre you finding yourself needing\nto catch your breath more?\nAccording to a published in a\nRespiratory Medicine journal,\nthere is a strong link between stress\nand respiratory symptoms.\nDuring periods of intense stress,\nyour body is trying to prepare itself\nto run away or fight for its life.\nThis mechanism, called\nfight or flight response,\nmay sometimes manifest itself\nas a shortness of breath.\nYou may feel like you're barely\nable to catch your breath,\nsuffocating, hyperventilating,\nor having a tightness in your chest.\nOf course, shortness of\nbreath can also be linked\nto other problems, so if you're\nfinding this problematic,\nit's best to make an appointment\nwith a healthcare provider.\nFeeling your mind and body giving up\nunder all the pressure is extremely tough.\nIt's important to know,\nhowever, that you're not alone,\nand getting help is possible.\nMaking an appointment\nwith a healthcare provider\nor mental health professional\nis a great first step\nto getting your health,\nboth mental and physical,\nback on track.\nSimilarly, taking small steps at home,\nlike improving your eating habits,\ngetting a regular sleep schedule,\nand reaching out to loved\nones or faith leaders\ncan help you in your journey as well.\nWe hope you were able to\nfind this video helpful.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand
