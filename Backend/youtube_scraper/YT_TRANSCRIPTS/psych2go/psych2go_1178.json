have strong\nfeelings for an ex-partner?\nIs there someone you've been dating\nwho's confessed they no longer\nwish to see romantically?\nIf you are dealing with unrequited love,\nyou're not alone my friend.\nSocial psychologist, Roy\nBaumeister says 98% of people\nhave suffered from unrequited love\nat one point in their life.\nSo what should you do about it?\nHow do you move on?\nWell, here are a few tips\non how to deal with unrequited love.\nNumber one.\nAccept their feelings\nand the end of a possible\nrelationship with them.\nHave you let them know how you feel?\nIf they seem comfortable\ndiscussing the topic,\nlet them know how you feel about them.\nAn open discussion about how you both feel\ncould be a great start.\nOnce you found out how they feel,\nyou then might have an\neasier time moving on.\nDo they not feel the same way?\nWell, the first step in this case\nwould be to accept how they feel\nand close the door on that\npossible relationship with them.\nThey've let you know\nthey're not interested\nin a relationship with you.\nFinding out how they feel can be a way\nto rip off the bandaid and\nstart the journey to moving on.\nIt's best to stop any flirting with them\nand stop any begging for them\nto reconsider their feelings for you.\nAccept your life won't be with them.\nMove forward with other\nlife possibilities.\nNumber two.\nStop daydreaming about them.\nSo how do you begin to accept\nthe end of a possible relationship?\nWell, do you find yourself\ndaydreaming about them?\nIf you simply have a crush\nand don't know how they feel,\nlet them know your feelings.\nDon't think that'll work?\nTry looking for signs they\nlike you in the first place.\nDo they get nervous and smile around you,\nengage in conversations with you,\nstare at you, look interested\nin what you have to say,\neven know you exist?\nIf all signs show they don't like you\nand you know they're unavailable,\nit's time to stop the daydreaming.\nEach time you catch yourself\ndaydreaming about them,\nfocus your attention on\nsomething else you desire.\nThis could be a passion,\na goal or something else.\nNumber three.\nAllow yourself to mourn the\nidea of being with them.\nStill having trouble accepting\nthey aren't interested in\npursuing a relationship with you?\nWell, perhaps you first need\nto mourn the loss of this idea\nthat you two could've been\ntogether, because you can't.\nIt was an idea, a daydream,\nor perhaps maybe you were\ntogether at one point,\nbut you both have changed.\nAllow yourself to feel\nwhatever it is you're feeling.\nWelcome this sadness in,\nshed a tear, express your\nfeelings to someone you trust\nand then maybe you'll have\nan easier time moving on\nafter you've allowed yourself\nto express the emotions\nto yourself or a friend.\nDon't judge yourself for\nfeeling a certain way strongly.\nIf you allow yourself to mourn,\nthen it may be easier for\nthese feelings to pass\nwith due time and acceptance.\nNumber four.\nDistract yourself with passion\nprojects and new skills.\nSo how do you pass the time?\nDistract yourself.\nPick up that old dusty\nguitar and get practicing.\nStart a passion project,\nlearn a new skill,\ntake a weekend trip.\nAll of these things are great distractions\nand the distractions\nwhere you make progress\nand learn something new are even better.\nTurn the focus on yourself instead\nand pour your heart into something else\nbesides romantic love.\nYou may even love yourself\nmore in the process.\nNumber four.\nRealize they aren't as\nperfect as they seem.\nStill have a hard time dealing\nwith feelings for your crush?\nWell, maybe they aren't as perfect\nas you make them out to be in your head.\nThink about it.\nAre you building something up\nin your head that isn't there?\nWe all have flaws, we're human.\nWe still love others, flaws and all,\nbut you may have missed out\non some of your crush's flaws,\nbecause you think they're more\nperfect than they really are.\nYou may have accidentally\nput your crush on a pedestal\nwhen it's perhaps the idea\nof them that's perfect\nthan them in actuality.\nThe sooner you realize they're\njust human and not perfect,\nthe easier time you'll have in moving on.\nAnd number six, know that\nthere won't always be closure.\nStill, keep moving forward.\nAre you looking for closure?\nWell, you might need to end your search,\nbecause there isn't always\nclosure in every relationship.\nYou can't always expect closure\nand you can't depend on it to move on,\notherwise you may spend a long\nand miserable time waiting for it.\nIf you have a crush that's unavailable,\nyou may be wondering if they\nwould still choose you somehow.\nIf you've told them how you feel\nand there are no signs\nthey like you romantically,\nit's best to stop waiting\nfor signs that aren't there.\nThere won't always be\na fulfilling discussion\nwhere they give closure or\nsay what you need to hear.\nThe trick is to keep moving\nforward and sooner or later,\nyou may realize you did receive closure,\na different kind through a passage of time\nand self reflection.\nYou closed the book on them yourself.\nSo how will you deal with unrequited love?\nWhat will be your distraction?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this\nvideo and if you did,\ndon't forget to click the like
