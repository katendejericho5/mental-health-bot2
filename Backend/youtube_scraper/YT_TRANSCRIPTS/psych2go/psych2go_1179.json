    "transcript": "- [Amanda] When you're asked,\n\"What's it like growing up?\"\nIs your immediate feeling one of warmth,\nsupport, or wholesomeness,\nor do you suddenly feel a little tense,\nremembering consistent\ncriticism, feeling shame,\nor being a scapegoat for everything?\nThat parental relationship\ncould be troubled and toxic,\nwhich would leave you,\neven now, feeling confused,\nmaybe anxious or lost.\nWe get that entertainment\nsources out there\nshow nothing but the\ntoxic-turned-gold story of parenting\nand we are here to shed\nsome truth on that.\nNamely, that reality isn't like that\nand you aren't obligated to\nbelieve the Hollywood fantasy.\nHopefully, these next bits of truth\nwill help all of you\nout there find some hope\nor at least a starting point to healing.\nNumber one, accept that they won't change.\nQuick, picture ideal parents in your mind.\nWe're willing to bet that details aside,\nthe ideal parent loves their\nchildren unconditionally,\nmeeting their child's needs\nwith all their actions firmly\nset to benefit the child.\nToxic parents don't do this.\nThey often don't even come close\nto meeting the child's\nneeds for love and support,\nwhich has a lasting damaging impact.\nEven the idea that parents\nwould willingly do this\nis abhorrent,\nso we hold onto the belief\nthat once we become adults and succeed\nor present evidence of what they've done,\nthose parents will be remorseful,\nchanging their whole mindset.\nThis expectation will provide\nnothing but disappointment.\nIn fact, you may have already\ntried and been let down.\nSo you thought, \"Maybe next\ntime if I do this one thing.\"\nStop.\nIt won't be the next\ntime or the time after.\nYou know why?\nBecause it's not you that's the problem.\nThey won't change and that\nis neither your obligation\nnor responsibility.\nThose needs for love and affection\nweren't met by your parents as a child\nand they won't be as an adult.\nSo, let it go.\nYeah, sing it if you need to.\nThe good news is, though,\nyou don't need them to do it for you.\nYou can meet those needs yourself\nfrom another source of your choice.\nThis will allow you\nto have a different\nrelationship with your parents\nbased on reality and not wishes.\nNumber two, you are the\nmaster of your own happiness.\nYour parents do not decide your happiness.\nThey aren't the happy key,\nwhereby if only you have\nthat secure relationship,\nyou'd be happy.\nIf you're banking on this,\nyou've given them all the power\nand it doesn't belong to them, it's yours.\nYes, we naturally desire certain things.\nHowever, we are the only\nones who get to decide\nif that is something that\nis a part of our happy.\nHappiness is, and always\nwill be an inside job.\nNumber three, acknowledge\nthat you are not at fault\nfor your childhood pain.\nToxic parents manipulate\nand a part of it is convincing the child\nthat all the abuse is their fault.\nThat's not true.\nPerhaps they implied or outright said\nthat if you hadn't done this\nthing or acted that way,\nthey would never have gotten angry,\nwould never have been forced to abuse you.\nThey're leaving out that\nif it wasn't that thing,\nit would've been something else.\nThe abuse is because of\ntheir defect, not yours.\nTheir inability to deal\nwith their own shortcomings\nis why they blamed you.\nIt wasn't your fault\nthen and it isn't now.\nNumber four,\nyou are not irreparably broken.\nWhen your past haunts you,\nit's easy to slide into the belief\nthat the childhood wounds will never heal,\nforever thwarting your ability\nto have a healthy relationship.\nAll right, Morpheus time.\nWhat if we told you that it's\nperfectly possible to heal?\nThe caveat is that,\nwell, it's gonna take effort on your part.\nWe understand it won't be easy.\nHowever, the fact that\nyou recognize the trauma\nis affecting you\nand your ability to form\na healthy relationship\nmeans you're already\npracticing self-awareness.\nYou see the issue and know it.\nIf you know what it is,\nyou can grab that little\nmonster and deal with it,\nlike reach out to a professional\nfor effective guidance.\nFor example, talk therapy\nhelps you process your past\nand increase your level of self-awareness.\nAnd number five, forgiving\nthem is not required\nfor healing to begin.\nAs much as we all make\ngripe about adulting,\nthere is one advantage.\nYou have the capacity and\nfreedom to care for yourself.\nYour nurture, comfort, and improvement\nare no longer dependent upon your parents.\nYou are not required to\nforgive what they did.\nYou do need to acknowledge\nthat it happened, though,\nso you can squeeze the release clasp\nstopping their garbage\nfrom dragging you down.\nHaving toxic parents may\nstart in your childhood,\nbut you're not obligated to let it haunt\nand guilt you for the rest of your life.\nGrasp your identity.\nAllow yourself to\nacknowledge your strength\nto accept what happened and heal.\nYou are no longer a child\nand they do not decide your future.\nDid any of these tips surprise you?\nDo you recognize any of this in others?\nPlease discuss, comment,\nand give us a like.\nCatch you next time."
