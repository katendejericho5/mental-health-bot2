    "transcript": "making friends is difficult but\nrewarding however losing friends is the\nrisk we take whenever we begin a\nfriendship friendships change over the\ncourse of life and not always for the\nbetter so when a friendship does come to\nan end here are a few things to remember\nnumber one it's okay to grieve the loss\nand accept your emotions something\nunexpected happens when a close\nfriendship ends it feels like a genuine\nloss according to relationship counselor\nVictor sander the grief that we feel at\nthe end of a friendship is extremely\nsimilar to the grief we experience at\nthe end of any key relationship like a\nfamily member or romantic partner it's\nnormal to feel regret sadness and anger\nwithout your friend by your side you may\nnot know what to do with yourself that's\nwhy you should take time to grieve the\nloss and accept your emotions as you\nwork your way through your emotions and\nfigure out how to process everything\nanother thing to remember is number two\nletting go of resentment will help you\nour first reaction to someone leaving or\nbetraying us is to get angry it's an\nunderstandable reaction whether a\nfriendship ended suddenly or because of\na chain of events you may feel anger\nmixed in with a bunch of other emotions\ndon't let this feeling drive your\nactions try to avoid talking about them\nto your other friends or taking actions\nthat you know will hurt your ex-friend\nBeating into that instinctual reaction\ncan end up making you even more\nmiserable you may even learn to resent\nyourself for the end of the Friendship\naccording to psychotherapist Amanda Anne\nGregory resent is an emotional response\nto something you perceive as wrong an\ninsult or injury if you resent your\nfriend it means that something needs\nyour attention once that friendship has\nended that resentment that you felt no\nlonger serves a purpose there's nothing\nto fix so you can breathe a little\neasier and work through the emotions you\nfeel about them you can put that energy\ntowards other areas in your life or\nsimply grieving number three this is a\ntime for reflection and learning in our\nlives there are certain events that can\nteach us a lot about ourselves if we let\nthem an ending friendship can be a\ntreasure Trove of information according\nto psychologist Pierre vermesh\nintrospection allows us to see things\nmore objectively when a friendship ends\nbeing introspective can help you see\nthings objectively not blaming anyone\nbut coming to an understanding of how\nexactly things came to be as they are if\na friendship has ended now is a good\ntime to ask yourself questions about it\nif this person drove you away find out\nwhat it is about them that created\ntension what were the red flags in you\nor your ex-friend that could have helped\nyou avoid this situation what are some\nways you could have improved yourself is\nthere something you were doing that was\ncounterproductive it sounds like the\nbeginning of a rabbit hole so as you\nlook into it and reflect on everything\nremember that you like all people will\ncontinue to learn and grow over your\nentire life if you feel like you may\nhave been the person at fault don't beat\nyourself up over it learn from it number\nfour no one can look after you like you\nhuman beings require social interaction\naccording to psychologist William Bowski\nand colleagues without friendships we\nmay struggle to deal with stress to grow\nas people and fail to seek out new\nexperiences but just because we need\nfriends doesn't mean we are completely\nincapable of doing these on our own\nfriendships have their benefits but no\none can know what you need better than\nyourself if you've just ended a\nfriendship with someone close do the\nthings that you like to do on your own\nnow is also a great time to chase\npassions and do the art or writing\nyou've always wanted to do but never had\ntime for there is a lot of fun to be had\noutside of friendships for now focus on\nself-care and the things that make you\nhappy and number five you are capable of\nmoving on most people have more than one\nfriend but that doesn't mean that the\nfriendship you had is replaceable maybe\nyou just clicked with this person in a\nway that you haven't with anyone else\nyou may not get this friendship back but\nthe potential for you to have something\neven better is always there according to\nrelationship therapist Jamie Waxman if\nthis friendship really has to end and\nyou want to move on it may be beneficial\nto get a sense of closure bearing in\nmind all of the reflecting you've been\ndoing the emotions you've been dealing\nwith and the resentment you've let go of\nyou may finally be in a good enough\nposition to send them one final message\nor meet in person to tell them how you\nfelt and to express what you've learned\nfrom your time as their friend it\ndoesn't have to be dramatic or\naggressive the best closure is the kind\nthat comes peacefully wish them well and\ncontinue your journey without them\nremember that no one is replaceable and\nthat includes you there are so many\npeople out there for you that you might\nnot have met yet if you want to be our\nfriend click subscribe good luck psych\nto goers you've got this"
