    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Have you ever\nexperienced physical symptoms\nand not known why?\nIt could be that you're\nexperiencing anxiety\nwithout realizing it.\nSo what exactly is anxiety?\nExperiencing occasional\nmoments of anxiety is normal,\nsuch as when facing a problem at work\nor before taking an\nexam where you may feel\nyour heart beating rapidly,\nsweaty palms or nausea.\nBut these symptoms of\nnervousness dissolve over time.\nWhile you may have experienced\nthese symptoms at some point,\nanxiety is more than\ntemporary worrying or stress.\nWorries and stress arise\nfrom external triggers\nsuch as an upcoming deadline\nor an argument with a loved one.\nAnxiety on the other hand is persist worry\nin the absence of stressors.\nThe American Psychology\nAssociation defines it as\nan emotion characterized by apprehension\nand somatic symptoms of tensions\nin which an individual\nanticipates impending danger,\ncatastrophe or misfortune.\nAside from its mental symptoms,\nanxiety also produce a\nroster of physical symptoms\nsuch as insomnia, fatigue\nand muscle tension.\nMost people pay more attention\nto the physical symptoms\nas they're easy to identify,\nand as a result tend to treat the symptoms\nrather than the underlying cause.\nSo with that said, here\nare six symptoms of anxiety\nthat can help you discern if\nit's an illness or anxiety.\nNumber one, irritability.\nYes, this symptom may seem vague\nbecause when you're unwell,\nwho wouldn't be a bit irritated?\nHowever, if you find\nyourself getting worked up\nover the slightest things, that\ncould be a sign of anxiety.\nAnxiety triggers our fight\nflight or freeze response.\nIt also makes you believe that\nyou're constantly in danger\nwhich reduces your tolerance to stress.\nAs your stress tolerance decreases\nyou become more susceptible\nto snapping at someone.\nAccording to statistics, only\na small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nIf you're not subscribed yet\nand you enjoy what you see\ndo consider hitting the subscribe button.\nThis encourages you hoops algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content\nto more people out there.\nNumber two, depersonalization\nor derealization.\nAnother sign that your\nphysiological symptoms\nare the result of anxiety\nand not a sickness\nis if you experience frequent\nbouts of derealization\nor depersonalization.\nBoth symptoms disrupt\nhow you perceive yourself\nand the world.\nDerealization is a sensation\nof being outside of your body\nand is a frightening thing to experience.\nOne minute you can be\nwalking down the street\nand suddenly everything feels\ntwo dimensional or unreal.\nDepersonalization is usually described\nas an out of body experience.\nMost times you feel like you're watching\nand hearing yourself in real time,\nbut your actions feel distant\nlike you're not the person doing them\nand your limbs or body\ncan appear distorted\nand foreign to you.\nReports show that stress and\nanxiety are the primary causes\nof derealization and depersonalization\nbecause your fight or flight\nresponse to stress floods\nyour brain with adrenaline\nwhich redirects blood\nfrom the brain to the larger\nmuscle groups and core.\nBecause your brain has less blood\nyou may feel more lightheaded,\nand as a result you may\nexperience derealization\nand depersonalization.\nIf this happens to you,\nit helps to breathe.\nThe adrenaline usually\ntakes two to three minutes\nto metabolize but you may take 20 minutes\nto calm down physically and mentally.\nNumber three, phobias\nand coping mechanisms.\nAnother sign that you're\nexperiencing anxiety\nand not a physical\nillness is if you notice\nthat you've developed new\nand unexplainable phobias.\nWe all have phobias whether\nthey developed during childhood\nor are the result of a bad experience.\nPhobias are our brain's way of\ntrying to keep us from harm.\nHowever, some phobias are\nthe results of anxiety\nand can become obstacles\nin your daily life.\nTechnically phobias are\ncategorized as anxiety disorders\nand fall into two group;\nspecific and complex.\nSpecific phobias usually\nstem from a bad experience,\nbut complex phobias stem from\nmental or emotional distress.\nSpecific phobias usually\ndon't need treatment\nbut complex phobias, like a agoraphobia,\nthe fear of being in busy\nplaces and social phobia do.\nThese phobia opioids can\nmake you feel more alone\nand can also affect your self-esteem.\nNumber four, attacks, trouble breathing.\nA telltale sign of anxiety is\nexperiencing a panic attack\nor anxiety attack.\nThough both terms are\nused interchangeably,\nthey're different.\nA panic attack is a sudden\noverwhelming surge of emotion\nsuch as fear and discomfort.\nYou may feel your chest tighten\nas your breathing has stopped.\nYou may also feel dizzy or lightheaded.\nWhile anxiety attacks\nhave similar symptoms,\nthey're a bit different as\nthey're the result of symptoms\nthat have been gradually building up.\nNumber five, gastrointestinal disruptions.\nGastro intestinal issues\nare another sign of anxiety\nbut can also arise independently\nof your mental health.\nWhile anxiety and gastro\nillnesses are mutually exclusive,\nthere is research supporting the theory\nthat anxiety causes\ngastrointestinal disorders\nsuch as irritable bowel syndrome\nand studies have shown the comorbidity\nbetween anxiety and\nirritable bowel syndrome.\nThere's lots of research that treatment\nfor some gastrointestinal\ndisorders may involve therapy.\nAnd number six, physiological strangeness.\nA final sign that you're\nexperiencing anxiety\nis if you feel tingling or numbness\nusually in your face and limbs,\nwhich is the feeling of blood\nrushing to your extremities\nas your fight or flight response kicks in.\nWhile blood rushes to our extremities,\nother areas of your body can feel weak.\nTingling and numbing can also\nbe caused by hyperventilation\nwhich indirectly happens\nwhen you're anxious.\nAlong with the symptoms\nlisted in this article,\nthere are other ways\nanxiety can manifest itself.\nDespite its symptoms,\nanxiety is manageable.\nPlease reach out to a\nmedical health professional\nor a therapist for help.\nDo you recognize any of\nthese
