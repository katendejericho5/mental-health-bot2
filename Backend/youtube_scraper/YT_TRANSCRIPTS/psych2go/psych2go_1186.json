    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nNearly 2/3 of individuals\nwith bipolar disorder\nhave been misdiagnosed at\nsome point in their lives.\nPerhaps even more troubling\nis that it takes an average\nof 10 years from the time\na person experiences their\nfirst bipolar mood episode\nuntil they receive bipolar\ndisorder treatment.\nThis treatment gap is the result\nof widespread misunderstandings\nabout bipolar disorder\nand how it shows in episodes,\nas well as a general aversion\nto discussing this persistent\npsychological disorder,\nespecially when symptoms are\npresent in a young person.\nBefore we take a look\nat the differences between\nBPD and bipolar disorder,\nlet's take a moment to\nunderstand what these terms mean.\nWhat is bipolar disorder?\nAccording to APA,\nbipolar disorder is a\ngroup of mood disorders\nin which symptoms of mania\nand depression alternate.\nIn the DSM-5-TR and the DSM-5,\nthe group includes primarily\nthe following subtypes:\nbipolar I disorder,\nin which someone fluctuates\nbetween episodes of mania or hypomania\nand major depressive episodes\nor experience a mix of these,\nand bipolar II disorder\nin which the individual fluctuates\nbetween major depressive\nand hypomanic episodes\nand cyclothymic disorder.\nWhat is borderline\npersonality disorder, or BPD?\nBorderline personality disorder\nis defined as a personality disorder\ncharacterized by a longstanding\npattern of instability\nin mood, interpersonal\nrelationships, and self-image\nthat is severe enough to\ncause extreme distress\nor interfere with social and\noccupational functioning.\nAmong the manifestations of this disorder\nare self-damaging behavior,\nlike gambling, overeating,\nand substance use;\nintense or unstable relationships,\nuncontrollable temper outbursts,\nuncertainty about self-image,\ngender, goals, and loyalties;\nshifting, self-defeating behavior,\nlike fights, suicidal gestures,\nor chronic feelings of\nemptiness and boredom.\nIn summary, BPD is a type\nof personality disorder\nthat causes people to feel, think, relate,\nand behave differently than\npeople without the condition.\nBipolar disorder is a\ntype of mood disorder,\nwhich is a category of illnesses\nthat can cause severe mood changes.\nQuality and degree.\nThe first major distinction\nis that bipolar disorder\nis a primary mood disorder,\nwhereas borderline is a\nprimary personality disorder\nmarked by long-term\ninterpersonal dysfunction.\nAs a result, bipolar disorder\nshows up in mood episodes\nwith intervals of balance in between,\nreferred to as the baseline mood zone.\nAs a result, the symptoms\nof bipolar disorder\nare defined as episodic.\nIn contrast, borderline\npersonality disorder\nis when the conditions/symptoms\npersist across mood states.\nAs a bipolar type baseline mood zone,\npeople with borderline\npersonality disorder\nappear to be pleasant, calm or collected.\nRegardless of emotional state,\nborderline personality\nis frequently defined\nby an ongoing entangled and chaotic jumble\nof interpersonal\nconnections and self-image.\nDifferences in treatment approach.\nTo keep their condition under control,\nmost people with bipolar disorder\nrequire lifetime treatment.\nThis frequently involves medications,\nsuch as mood stabilizers,\nantipsychotics and antidepressants.\nPeople with bipolar disorder\ncan benefit from therapy\nto better understand their condition\nand build coping strategies.\nPeople with borderline\npersonality disorder\nfrequently require long-term treatment.\nSpecific types of psychotherapy are used\nto help people manage impulses,\nfeelings of distress or anger,\nand emotional oversensitivity\nto social interactions.\nMedications are occasionally used\nto aid with these symptoms,\nbut they aren't always helpful\nand aren't the primary focus of treatment\nfor borderline personality disorder.\nShort hospital stays\nare sometimes necessary\nto manage times of\ncrisis that pose a threat\nto one's safety and well-being.\nCauses of the symptoms.\nMood shifts in BPD are typically triggered\nby an environmental stressor,\nsuch as a disagreement with a loved one.\nMood shifts in bipolar disorder\nmay occur out of the blue,\nwithout any triggers.\nSleep cycles.\nDuring periods of mania and depression,\npeople with bipolar disorder\nhave severely disrupted sleep cycles.\nPeople with BPD usually tend\nto have a regular sleep cycle.\nRisk factors.\nThe link between bipolar\ndisorder and genetics\nis still a mystery.\nBipolar disorder is more common in people\nwho have a parent or\nsibling with the illness\nthan in the general population.\nHowever, most people who have\na close relative with the disorder\nwill not develop it.\nBorderline personality disorder is genetic\nand can be passed from\none person to another\nwithin a family.\nResearch suggests that people with BPD\nare five times more likely\nto have a close family\nmember with the disorder,\nsuch as a sibling or parent.\nSo, did you find yourself\nrelating to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nIf you or anyone you know\nis seriously struggling\nwith your mental and emotional well-being,\nplease seek help\nand talk to a mental\nhealthcare professional today.\nGetting in touch with the right person\ncan be a great first step\nto getting back on track.\nWhat are some things you've learned?\nWhat's something you\nwish to learn more about?\nAnd what's been your experience?\nLet us know in the comments.\nAnd as always, thanks\nso much for watching.\nWe will see you in the next video."
