    "transcript": "- [Narrator] When you think of\na highly intelligent person,\nwhat kind of habits come to mind?\nYou might think of a\nbrainiac wearing glasses,\nreading, books, and studying.\nBut did you know that there are other,\nlesser-known habits they engage in?\nHere are five odd habits\nhighly intelligent people have.\nNumber one, they are night owls.\nWhat time are you most active?\nResearch shows, that night owls\nare more intelligent than those\nwith regular sleep cycles.\nA 2009 study, published in the\nJournal of Personality and\nIndividual Differences,\nfound that high childhood IQ\nwas associated with nocturnal\nbehavior in adulthood.\nThe authors theorized,\nthat humans didn't evolve\nfor nocturnal activity\nbut highly intelligent people\noften choose to live life their own way,\nrather than sticking to\nsocietal conventions.\nSo instead of being active\nwhen everyone else is awake,\nthey stay up late,\nwhen they have no\nobligations or distractions\nso they can pursue their\ngoals more productively.\nNumber two, they are disorganized.\nHow much structure do\nyou like in your life?\nYou might think that plans,\nschedules, and systems,\nare a sign of intelligence\nbut research suggests,\nit's the other way around.\nStudies have found, that\nthe personality trait,\nthat has the strongest link\nwith high intelligence\nis low conscientiousness.\nThis means they have a preference\nfor disorder and flexibility,\nrather than organization and routine.\nResearchers believe, that\nhighly intelligent people\ndon't need rules, plans, and reminders,\nas they're smart enough to figure it out,\nand manage themselves.\nSometimes, order even restricts\ntheir freedom and originality.\nNumber three, they are loaners.\nHow much time do you spend alone?\nA study published in the\nBritish Journal of Psychology\nshowed that highly intelligent people\nspent a great deal of time alone.\nThey have many goals to pursue,\nto make the most of their\nabilities and ambitions\nwhich reduces the time\nthey spend socializing.\nOn the plus side, they tend to\nbe quite satisfied with this,\nas working on long-term objectives\ngives them a form of happiness\nthat nothing else can.\nHighly intelligent people\nare not only loaners,\nthey're happy being loaners.\nNumber four, they daydream.\nHow much do you focus on the task at hand?\nYou might think that\nhighly intelligent people,\nalways have a strong focus,\nso that they can accomplish\ntheir objectives.\nBut a 2013 study, published\nin Frontiers in Psychology,\nsuggests that mind-wandering,\nis another form of intelligent thinking,\nand that daydreaming should be seen,\nas a positive and\nconstructive mental technique,\nnot a distraction.\nHighly intelligent people use daydreaming\nto plan for the future,\nexplore creative solutions,\nand enhance the learning\nof new information.\nSome researchers even suggest,\nthat the attention demanded\nby modern schools and workplaces,\nis hurting our intelligence\nbecause it reduces our capacity,\nfor mental reflection and daydreaming.\nAnd number five, they talk to themselves.\nWhat do you think\nwhen you see someone\ntalking to themselves?\nIt might look a bit odd from the outside\nbut researchers believe,\nthat this habit is actually\na useful technique,\nused by highly intelligent people.\nIn a study published,\nin the Quarterly Journal\nof Experimental Psychology,\nit was found to improve,\nvisual perception and understanding.\nTalking out loud,\nallows the brain to retrieve\ninformation more efficiently,\nwhich helps to interpret\nthe environment around you,\nfind objects, and explore ideas.\nSo when you see someone\ntalking to themselves,\nthey might be a highly intelligent person,\nusing this technique, to\nthink of solutions and ideas,\nmuch faster than everyone else.\nSo there you have it.\nFive odd habits, highly\nintelligent people have.\nDo you relate to any of the habits\nmentioned in this article?\nLet us know in the comments below,\nand don't forget to like,\nand share this video,\nif you think someone else\nwill find it interesting.\nAs always the studies and references used,\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time,\nand thanks for watching."
