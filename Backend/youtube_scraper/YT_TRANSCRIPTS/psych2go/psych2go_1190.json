    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nBefore we start, we would\nlike to thank you all\nfor the support you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that.\nSo, thanks again.\nNow back to the video.\nDid you know that every\nlittle thing you do\ncan reveal signs about\nyour personality type?\nEven the way you walk can\ninfluence how others see you.\nA particular study carried\nout in 2017 by Caleb Backe,\na health and wellness expert\nshared and compared the\nwalking speed and styles\nwith the Big Five personality traits\nThe traits included were openness,\nagreeableness, neuroticism,\nextroversion and conscientiousness.\nBefore we begin, we\nwould like to remind you\nthat this video is not\nintended to make you feel\nover conscious about how you walk,\nbut it's a way to give you some insight\ninto how your walking style can influence\nhow others may think of you.\nSo with that said, Psych2Go presents,\nwhat the way you walk reveals\nabout your personality.\nNumber one, the executive.\nDo you walk at a fast pace\nwithout focusing too much on\nwhat's going on around you?\nAre you the type to hold your head up high\neven though you're absorbed\nin your own thoughts?\nIf so, you may have an\nexecutive personality type.\nAs an executive, your\nmain personality trait\naccording to the Big\nFive personality traits\nis conscientiousness.\nYou are goal-oriented and\na great problem solver\nbut your focus strides\nand your tendency to\nignore the surroundings\nmay give an unfriendly and\nintense vibe to other people.\nNumber two, the politician.\nHave you ever been told that\nyou walk in a lively manner,\nperhaps you hold your head up\nhigh with your chest forward\nand shoulders back?\nThis walk describes the politician.\nSince politicians are known to be prideful\nand graded speaking and\nengaging with people.\nYour main personality traits\nare openness and extroversion,\nalso desiring a acknowledgement\nand appreciation.\nYou're also someone who enjoys challenges\nbut gets bored very easily.\nNumber three, the warrior.\nDo you have a habit of\nkeeping your head down\nwhile walking slowly?\nThese two traits are commonly found\nin those who worry a lot.\nSo if your answer\nto the question is yes,\nthen you might be a warrior.\nYour inner cautiousness\nmakes you take slower and shorter strides\nbecause you're always\nlooking up for yourself.\nWarriors also have the personality trait\nof introversion or low extroversion.\nSo you might find yourself constantly\nkeeping your eyes on the ground\nrather than walking with\nyour head held high.\nNumber four, the chiller.\nAnother type of walk\nis called the chiller.\nAnd this is when you walk at a slow pace\nwhile taking soft steps\nand where your body is in a\nloose and relaxed posture.\nThe chiller refers to someone\nwho has a very easygoing\nand relaxed approach to life.\nYour main personality\ntraits are a agreeableness\nsince you're someone who\ntends to focus on others\nmore than yourself.\nAnd you're also very calm and intuitive\nbut may give off the\nimpression of a slacker\nor someone who's easily\ninfluenced by others.\nNumber five, the arm-crosser.\nAre you someone who\nprefers to cross your arms\nwhen you walk?\nThis action usually signifies\na desire to distance\nor isolate yourself by\ncreating a psychological\nand physical barrier,\nwhich in turn can signal vulnerability.\nHowever, studies have shown\nthat there is a special importance\non who you're giving the impression to.\nBecause crossing your arms with strangers\nhas a different meaning\nto crossing your arms\nwhen surrounded by friends.\nUltimately strangers\nwill get the impression\nthat you're distancing yourself,\nwhile friends will get the impression\nthat you're interested and\nengaged in the conversation.\nNumber six, the stomper.\nDo you tend to walk\nwhile taking loud steps\nthat resemble a stomp?\nThis action can give people around you\nthe impression that you\nare angry, frustrated\nor that you are a persistent person.\nIn addition to it possibly meaning\nthat you have a short temper.\nIt can also give the impression\nthat you have a childish nature.\nAnd number seven, the show-boat.\nLastly, the show-boat\ndescribe someone who walks\nwith a high level of\nconfidence and intent.\nAlong with walking with\nyour head held high\nand your shoulders back,\nyou also have a tendency\nto emphasize gestures\nsuch as swaying your arms or hips\nin an exaggerated manner\nto attract the attention\nof those around you.\nThe show-boat generally refers\nto people who like to brag or boast.\nYour personality has traits\nof command and charisma.\nAlthough people might get the impression\nthat you're self-absorbed.\nSo which type of walk do you do?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you
