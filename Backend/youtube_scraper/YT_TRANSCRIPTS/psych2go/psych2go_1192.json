    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nhave you ever wondered if\nyou're actually introverted?\nWhile many people know their\ncamp almost immediately,\nthose who fall somewhere along\nthe middle of the spectrum\ncan have a harder time determining\nwhere they really stand.\nIf so, hopefully this video\ncan give you a clearer picture\nand answer your questions.\nLet's look at six signs\nyou're not an introvert.\nNumber one, you prefer being with friends,\nbut you don't dislike strangers.\nEveryone enjoys hanging out with friends,\nbut when you're with new acquaintances,\nhow do you feel about it?\nIf you feel at ease talking with strangers\nand can become friends\nwith them right away,\nyou probably lean more closely\nto the extroverted side.\nWhile introverts aren't necessarily shy\nor socially awkward,\nit can be tiring for them\nto effortlessly let conversations\nflow with strangers,\nunless they hit a common\nground straight away.\nAmbiverts and extroverts,\non the other hand,\ndon't mind the prospect\nof entertaining strangers.\nThey can hit things off\nand genuinely enjoy\nconversations about most things\nstraight away.\nTwo, you're spontaneous.\nDo you like going out on\nevery occasion you can\nrather than staying\nhold up in bed all day?\nIf you find enjoyment in\ngoing on impulse trips alone,\nor with your friends,\nyou might have a more\nextroverted side in you\nthat you might have initially realized.\nMost introverts tend to be\nmore analytical and observant,\nthinking about a situation thoroughly\nbefore taking a plunge.\nOn the other hand,\nif you'd rather go with the flow\nand see where things lead you,\nyou're probably an extrovert.\nNumber three, take a timeout.\nWere you an extroverted kid?\nWere you somewhat popular,\nor a class clown who enjoyed\nmaking everyone laugh?\nIf you had extroverted\ntendencies when you were younger\nbut have since outgrown them,\nyou might still have a part of you\nthat enjoys interacting with other people.\nMaybe some traumatic events\nhave led you to stop\nbeing your usual self.\nMaybe being isolated is a coping mechanism\nrather than something you're\nnaturally drawn towards.\nWhoa.\nWell, people can grow and change.\nIt's always worth it to take a step back\nand find the roots of why you've changed.\nIf you can't do it yourself,\ntalk to a therapist or\na good friend about it.\nNumber four, you feel uninspired\nif you stay home on the weekends.\nDo you hate having nothing\nto do on the weekends?\nYou may be an extrovert.\nIntroverts are perfectly\ncontent having nothing planned\nfor the days they get to rest.\nSome may even enjoy the\nidea of canceled plans\nif it gets them to laze\naround in bed all day.\nExtroverts do love being\nout and about though,\nwhether it's to meet friends or to party.\nWhile introverts love their\nsocial time, occasionally,\nextroverts would always try to find ways\nto fill up their weekend routine\nwith a high energy and social endeavor,\nlike a party or meeting up with friends.\nFive, you're equally good at\ncommunicating and listening.\nDo you like shuffling\nbetween taking the lead\nand following others?\nIf so, those are key\nqualities of ambiverts.\nExtroverts are more attuned\nto talking than listening,\nwhile introverts typically\nprefer listening.\nHowever, if you find yourself\ndrawn to both qualities,\nyou may not necessarily be an extrovert,\nbut an ambivert instead.\nAn ambivert is capable\nof making some small talk\nthen can switch gears and get to business\nwith a good mixture of both listening\nand communicating well with others.\nAnd number six, you can\nmatch the mood of the crowd.\nDo you excel in reading the room?\nCan you hop into conversation\nwith the same wavelength of someone else\nfairly easily?\nAn introvert may take some time\nfor themselves to diffuse\nand analyze situations,\nworking things through in their head\nand on how to respond to strangers.\nAmbiverts and extroverts,\non the other hand,\ncan break in and naturally\nconverse with other people\nmuch more readily.\nThey also typically enjoy the moment\nand are more free spirited\nthan their introverted counterparts.\nWe hope you learn\nsomething from this video.\nSo which one are you really,\nintrovert or extrovert?\nOr maybe you're an ambivert?\nDid you relate to any of the above signs?\nIf you did,\nlet us know in the comment section below.\nThat's all for now, Psych2Goers.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember to subscribe to \"Psych2Go\"\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used\nare added in the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching,\nuntil next time.\n(gentle music)"
