    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome back.\n(sighs) Why did this happen?\nWhether you saw it coming or\nnot, the feeling is the same.\nYou're shattered.\nYou feel like your heart is\nbroken into multiple pieces.\nLife dishes out many\nunforeseen heartbreaks.\nThough the experiences may be similar,\nevery hurt is personal.\nTraumatic events from your\npast can leave you wounded.\nOver time, they take shape\nof an emotional wound itself.\nLike a physical wound, it's\nalways in your awareness.\nYou're protective and sensitive\nto anything that might re-injure it.\nAnd the same sensitivity often makes you\neven more vulnerable.\nHere are seven signs\nof an emotional wound.\nLet's all learn together, shall we?\n(soft music)\nNumber one, you cry\neasily over small things.\nDo you shed emotional tears\nalong with the fictional\ncharacter you're reading?\nIs there such thing as\ncrying too often or too much?\nSome people cry while reading a sad book\nor watching videos of baby animals\nwhile others cry only at funerals.\nIf you've ever had tears\nwell up in a meeting\nor wept out loud in a movie theater,\nyou may have wondered if it's normal.\nIt is found that women cry on\naverage 5.3 times per month\nand men cry an average\nof 1.3 times per month.\nTearfulness is commonly associated\nwith depression and anxiety,\nThis emotional state perpetuates\nwhen you've been emotionally\nhurt in the past,\nconsciously or subconsciously.\nAs a result, even the\nmere hint of anything\nthat arouses emotions\ncan cause tears to flow.\nNumber two, you lose interest\nin the things you used to enjoy.\nAt some point in their life,\nmost people would lose interest\nin things that used to excite them.\nEmotional hurt, however,\ntakes this loss to its limits.\nIt becomes impossible to draw enjoyment\nfrom things that once elicited excitement.\nYour emotional hurt makes even\npleasure seem like a task.\nYour world is drenched in gray,\nand you don't seem to\nhave the strength it takes\nto lift the paintbrush.\nNumber three, you get annoyed\neasily by people's behaviors.\nIrritability is the carbon\nmonoxide of emotional pollutants.\nNo one likes confrontation,\nbut you can run from it for only so long.\nAnger has its own role.\nBoth direct and indirect\nanger, or passive,\nis meant to communicate\nsomething important.\nWhat you really want is\nto connect and be heard.\nBut when anger is involved,\nthe result is often just the opposite.\nAggression in any form\nis the biggest hindrance\nto emotionally intelligent communication.\nPeople often think\npassive-aggressive communication\nis somehow better or nicer.\nIt's not. In fact, it\nmay actually be worse.\nIf you're looking for a true\nand meaningful connection\nand understanding with another person,\nyou need a better strategy.\nBeing compassionate with yourself\nand figuring out the source\ncan help bring yourself down\nwhen you're feeling on edge.\nBe compassionate with yourself.\nNumber four, you feel\nworthless and hopeless.\nHow can you increase your sense of worth?\nCan you earn it through what you do?\nHappiness is not obtained\nsolely by your achievements.\nSelf-worth based on\naccomplishments is pseudo-esteem\nand not the real thing.\nFeeling worthless often\ninvolves a sense of hopelessness\nand insignificance.\nSuch feelings often arise\ncommonly due to abuse or trauma\nor difficult situations\nthat pose a threat to a\nperson's sense of oneself.\nPinpointing the cause behind\nthese distorted thoughts\ncan help you to understand\nand address factors that\ncontribute to low self-esteem.\nNumber five, you keep\nreplaying the bad memories\nin your head.\nIs your head filled\nwith one single thought\nor a string of thoughts\nthat just keep repeating,\nand repeating, and repeating themselves?\nThe process of continuously\nthinking about the same thought,\nwhich tends to be sad or\ndark, is called rumination.\nYour history of emotional\nor physical trauma\nmakes you believe that by ruminating,\nyou'll gain insight into your life\nor a problem you're facing.\nAs when a ball is rolling downhill,\nit's easier to stop\nthe ruminating thoughts\nwhen they first start\nrolling and have less speed\nthan when they've\ngathered speed over time.\nIt helps to identify your trigger\nand find a distraction to\nbreak your thought cycle.\nFor example, calling a\nfriend or a family member,\ndoing chores around the house,\nreading a book, or walking\naround your neighborhood.\nThis helps to challenge\nthe onslaught of thoughts.\nNumber six, you feel too\nmuch until you're numb.\nAm emotional wound can also\ntrigger what is called apathy.\nEmotional hurt causes\nyou an emotional overload\nto the point that you become numb.\nIt's a form of self-defense\nagainst future hurt.\nApathy is a feeling, but\nit's also an attitude.\nAnd sadly, the attitude\nis one of indifference,\nunconcern, unresponsiveness,\ndetachment, and dispassion.\nEmotional hurt zaps you of so much energy\nthat you feel listless,\nalmost too paralyzed to act,\nand certainly without the will to do so.\nThis is why apathetic\nindividuals are easily identified\nby their passivity.\nYour interest in confronting\nlife's challenges\nis seriously compromised.\nYou just don't care anymore.\nTo defeat this stagnancy within,\nyou must be willing to commit\nto giving this apathy\nthe fight of its life,\neven though doing so\nfeels like it will take\na lot more energy and effort\nthan you're capable of.\nAnd number seven, you\nfeel clueless and stuck.\nEver had times when you\nfeel trapped or restless?\nWhere the life you're\nliving doesn't seem anything\nlike the life you wanted,\nas if on autopilot,\ngoing through the motions\nbut feeling unsatisfied?\nYour instincts are to shake it up,\nchange your job, or go on that vacation.\nBut that provides only a\ntemporary, not permanent, solution.\nInstead, the solution lies within.\nTopping up your ways of\nthinking about events\ncan actually help lead to new perspectives\nand diminish distress and anxiety.\nIt's important to do away\nwith your negative\nperceptions about yourself\nthat interfere with problem-solving.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with those out\nthere who need to hear this.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
