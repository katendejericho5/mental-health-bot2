    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey there Psych To Goers.\nWould you agree, actions\nspeak louder than words?\nThis can often be the case for some people\nespecially when it comes\nto expressions of love.\nSaying the three magic words\ncan be a nice thing to hear\nfrom your significant other,\nbut there are other\nways that people choose\nto express their love for others.\nHere are some signs which\nmay that somebody really\nloves you even though they don't say it.\nNumber one, you feel safe\nwith them or in their company.\nDo you ever have the feeling\nthat you're completely relaxed\nwhen in their presence?\nSafety is the cornerstone\nof any healthy relationship\nso it goes without saying\nthat having a partner who\nrespects you, your feelings,\nand your wellbeing may\nwell have loving feelings\nfor you and care for you deeply.\nFurthermore, feeling safe\nextends to feeling free\nto make your own decisions\nand being able to express\nyourself without fear of criticism\nor put downs.\nNumber two, they'll find ways\nto stay connected with you.\nDo they send good morning\nor goodnight texts when\nyou aren't together?\nAw, that's so sweet.\nIn this modern era of technology\nyou don't always need to\nsee each other physically\nin order to show affection.\nThe virtual realm can also\nshow that they care about you.\nSending something as simple\nas a text message can show\nthat someone is thinking about you.\nIf they make an effort to\nstay connected with you\nwhen you're absent from one another,\nthis may be an indicator\nthat the person has\nstrong feelings for you.\nNumber three, they actively listen to you\nand ask about your day.\nAre they always making it\na point to show an interest\nin what you do?\nA partner who loves you\nwill take an active interest\nin even the smallest details of your life.\nThis can help couples to build\ntheir love for each other\nand keep communication routes open.\nActive listening plays a key\nrole in healthy relationships.\nPartners acknowledge things\nwhich need to be improved\nas well as things which are going well\nwithout causing distress.\nNumber four, they make an effort to engage\nin physical touch with you.\nDo you often find yourself\nholding hands with them?\nSuch gestures are important\nfor maintaining intimacy\nand it may be one of the\nways that your partner shows\nthat they care.\nBethany Riccardi, a relationship educator,\nadvises that it is\nimportant to keep an eye out\nfor body language cues in your partner.\nIf your partner's love\nlanguage is physical touch,\nthen this could be a good indicator\nthat they are showing their\nlove through physical affection\nrather than through words.\nNumber five, they're proud\nto have you in their life.\nEven if your significant\nother has not dropped\nthat L bomb yet\nthat does not mean that\nthey're not feeling it.\nIf they've introduced you to\ntheir friends and close family\nand share pictures on social media,\nthat could demonstrate\nthat they're inviting you\ninto their world and that\nthey're pleased to share that\nwith the rest of the world.\nBut it is also true that\nnot everybody is public\nwhen it comes to displays\nof affection in this way.\nBut as long as they're\nnot keeping you a secret\nthen it's usually a clear sign\nthat they may have deep feelings for you.\nAnd number six, they are\neasy to communicate with.\nDoes communication come easy\nbetween you and your partner?\nThis is often a reassuring sign.\nLove requires open and\nhonest communication\nbut that does not always\nmean that you have to\nshare every private thought\nor feeling with them.\nIf they are the right person for you\nthen they understand that.\nFor a relationship to thrive,\ngood communication might\ninvolve things such as\ndiscussing emotions,\nobserving body language,\nidentifying areas of conflict,\nand checking in about\nboundaries in the relationship.\nIf you notice any of these\nsigns in your relationship\nthis may show that your partner\nhas loving feelings for you.\nIt's important to note\nthat people choose to\nsay those three words in their own time\nand it's not something\nwhich should be rushed\nor said for the sake of it.\nEven if somebody has not\nsaid that they love you\nor you did not observe\nthe signs just mentioned,\nit does mean that they don't\nhave loving feelings for you.\nSo give them the chance\nand continue to have open conversations\nabout your feelings towards each other.\nWhat are you your thoughts on this topic?\nAre there any more signs\nthat you've noticed?\nHoping to see you in the\ncomment section below.\nIf you found this video helpful\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with others.\nWondering about them as well.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych To Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nThanks for watching.\n(gentle music)"
