    "transcript": "the concept of self-love has been around\nsince the 50s today self- Lov looks a\nlittle different we've become familiar\nwith self-love practices like self-\nforgiveness and affirmations but the\nquestion lingers do these practices\ntruly fulfill our emotional needs the\nconcept of love in the modern world has\na lot of contradictions with technology\nwe've brought ourselves closer together\nthan ever before yet people are loner\nthan ever sometimes as we become\nseparated from friends and family we\nrely on ourselves to feel love D but can\nself-love be enough how love has changed\nthe friends and partners we end up with\nhave always depended in the communities\nwe are part of this hasn't changed with\ntechnology but the problems that we\nencounter are different The Game of Love\nHas Changed and some ways we are forced\nto be contradictory if we want to prove\nthat we love ourselves we might post a\npicture of ourselves on Instagram which\nin turn feeds us the external validation\nof others this raises the question if we\nlove ourselves why do we need external\nvalidation experimental psychologist\nElizabeth galiner asked that same\nquestion she found that the correlation\nbetween the likes we receive in our\nself-esteem is actually very minor this\nis likely because the act of self- Lov\nand social media has little to do with\nself- validation and more to do with the\nprocess of building strength and\nIndependence in other words self-love is\na process loving yourself openly is just\nthe part of the process and doesn't\nnecessarily portray the end result of\nbeing fully content within yourself as\nself-love is a NeverEnding adapting\nprocess it can't replace the love we\nneed from others the shape of love love\ncan take many shapes ancient Greek\nphilosophers broke it down into\nunconditional love familiar love\nromantic love guest love platonic love\nand self-love over time this has been\nsimplified and understood by\npsychologists as four types of Love\nplatonic love erotic or passionate love\nfamiliar love and a love of mankind you\nmay notice that this list excludes\nself-love self- Lov cannot fulfill us\nlike external love making it difficult\nto categorize it in the same way we need\nthe benefits of platonic familial and\nromantic love such as validation stress\nrelief and emotional support clearly\nexternal love comes with a lot of\nbenefits but as those of us who do feel\nlonely or worry about being loved know\nsometimes all we really need is a loving\nhug and that can come from any loved one\nphysical affection has been found to not\nonly soothe us and make us happy but it\ncreates beneficial cognitive and\nneurobiological changes too giving us\nall of those benefits with one simple\nact we can run a warm bath treat\nourselves with retail therapy or take\nourselves on solo dates but none of this\ncan replace what real physical affection\ncan do for us self-love or narcissism\nhaving a passion for yourself can be\ngreat you need a passion for yourself if\nyou want to believe that you can achieve\nall of your goals and be who you want to\nbe the scales can't tip to the side of\nnarcissism when your self-love depends\nin comparison when your love comes from\nbeing more intelligent or more beautiful\nthan others it is more likely to be\nnarcissism this is another reason why\nself-love isn't enough self- Lov can\ncome from narcissism or become\nnarcissism if it is your only source of\nlove this is why it is so important to\nextend your love to others to love and\nto be loved love is a transaction in\nself-love there is little to lose or\ngain we need the love of others just as\nmuch as we need people to offer our love\ntoo when we love someone we forego our\nown desires for their benefit you might\nthink this will be a distraction and\nyou'll be worse off by prioritizing\nother people however romantic love and\nparticular can increase our motivation\nand give us Direction in life ironically\nbeing loved can also improve our\nself-esteem more than self-love can\nunless you're intentionally cutting\nyourself off from people we typically\ndon't choose to go un loved it's\npossible friends don't come easily to\nyou or family has issues but the reality\nis that there are ways to find love to\nmake new friends to make a new family\nlove just needs to be shared if you feel\nlike you have no one but yourself to\nlove or be loved you can start by making\nnew friends reconnecting with old ones\nor even getting a pet having love in\nyour heart is a good thing no matter\nwhat if we're going to look after\nourselves we need to share our love with\nothers if this video taught you\nsomething new or gave you something to\nthink about leave a like And subscribe\nto Psy to go for more videos like this\nyou've got this"
