    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nThey say beauty is in\nthe eye of the beholder.\nDid you know that physical appearance\nis only one of the many\nfactors of attractiveness?\nBecause contrary to popular belief,\nbeauty is more than skin deep.\nIn fact, current psychological\nresearch actually states\nthat there are plenty\nof different behaviors,\nattitudes and personal qualities\nthat can make someone more attractive.\nSo, here are seven tried and true\npsychologically-backed ways\nthat you can instantly make\nyourself feel more attractive.\nNumber one, flash them a smile.\nResearch shows that smiling\nis one of the full proof ways\nwe can instantly look\nand feel more attractive\nbecause it expresses happiness, interest\nand enjoyment of the\nother person's company.\nWhen you flash them with a smile,\nit makes them feel more at ease around you\nand they're likely to reciprocate\nwith a smile of their own,\nwhich eases a lot of\nawkwardness and tension.\nJust be careful not to overdo it though\nso it doesn't come off\nas fake, forced or phony.\nNumber two, improve your posture.\nAnother effective way you can\nincrease your attractiveness\nis by sitting up straight\nand improving your posture.\nWhy? Because having good\nposture makes you look taller,\nmore confident and seem more put together.\nIt's also great for making\na good first impression.\nNumber three, wear clothes\nthat make you feel confident.\nOne of the reasons why people care so much\nabout the way they look\nor the way they're dressed\nis because your clothes\ncan actually tell people\na lot about you.\nEven if you're not\nparticularly stylish or trendy,\nas long as you know how to dress in a way\nthat suits you and flatters your figure,\nyou'll instantly look smarter,\nmore sophisticated and more attractive.\nYour personal style\nlets people know a bit more\nabout your personality.\nAnd of course, if you feel\ngood about the way you look,\nthen it's definitely\ngoing to make you feel\nmore attractive too.\nNumber four, crack a few jokes.\nAmong all the qualities and traits\nmost people tend to look\nfor in a romantic partner,\nhaving a good sense of humor\nis usually somewhere at\nthe top of their list.\nSo next time you see someone\nyou like and want to impress,\ndon't be afraid to crack a few\njokes and show off your wit.\nIf it lands, then you'll successfully\nhave demonstrated to the other person\nhow charming, playful, and fun you are.\nBut even if it doesn't,\nthere's still a good chance\nthey'll be endeared by it anyway.\nNumber five, do something exciting.\nMaybe you are in a band\nor play a musical instrument\nor write poetry or paint.\nMaybe you're a great singer or at dancer\nor cook delicious food.\nMaybe you love to travel,\nsurf or go hiking.\nThe bottom line is\nwhatever your particular hobbies might be,\nas long as you can show\npeople that it's a lot of fun\nand you enjoy it,\nthen it'll instantly\nmake you more attractive\nto them without fail.\nEven just being willing to\ntry something new and exciting\ncan be enough to make\npeople more attracted to us\nbecause it shows a positive, confident\nand fun-loving attitude.\nNumber six, nourish your mind,\nSimilar to having a good sense of humor,\nmost people fall for someone's mind\njust as much as they fall for their looks.\nSometimes even more.\nSo if you're looking to make\nyourself more attractive,\ntry doing something like reading books\non science or philosophy,\ncatching up with some contemporary news,\nimproving your chess skills\nor learning a new language.\nLearning new things will make you\na better conversationalist too.\nAnd number seven, love\nand accept yourself.\nLast but perhaps most importantly,\nnothing is more attractive\nthan someone who is\nsecure in their identity\nand sense of self worth.\nSelf-love and self-acceptance\nmakes someone who is\nbeautiful inside and out\nbecause they don't need\nto turn to other people\nfor external validation.\nThey know who they are\nand what they're worth\nand they won't waste any\ntime trying to impress you\nby being someone they're not,\nchasing after someone\nwho doesn't want them\nor changing who they are just\nto make you like them more.\nSelf-love and confidence are attractive.\nSo do you agree with what\nwe've mentioned here?\nWhat are some other ways that\nyou can feel more attractive?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nDon't forget to leave a like\nand share this video with friends\nwho may find some insight in it.\nAs always, all references\nused are in the description.\nUntil next time."
