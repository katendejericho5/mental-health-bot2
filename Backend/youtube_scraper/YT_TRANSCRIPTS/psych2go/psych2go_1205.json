    "transcript": "- Hello, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever felt stuck?\nMaybe there are some things\nthat are leaving you unhappy.\nSome little habits that\nend up doing more damage\nthan good in the long run?\nHow many things prevent\nyou from being happy?\nHere are some things that\ncan make you truly unhappy\nthroughout your day and in the long run.\nLet's recognize them now so we can see\nif we can replace them with\nsome healthier habits instead.\nNumber one: Extending your\nbedtime into the late hours.\nHow often do you neglect\nthat sleepy feeling\nyou experience late into the night\nafter yet again, another\ncat compilation video?\n\"Ah, but they're so cute,\"\nyou remind yourself.\nMy cat Whiskers and I love watching them.\nBut sleep is a necessity,\nwhile cat videos aren't.\nSorry, Whiskers.\nDo you often extend your\nbedtime when you don't have to?\nThe inevitable sleep\nprocrastination, revenge bedtime.\nDo you even go to bed at all?\nIt's recommended we get roughly seven\nto eight hours of sleep.\nLet's aim for the eight-hour\nmark, Psych2Goers.\nYou may be a night owl,\nbut you still need your Zs.\nSo set a bedtime and start winding down\nan hour or two before.\nThis will prevent you from\nfeeling foggy and groggy\nthroughout your day.\nSleep deprivation may lead to putting you\nin a bad mood as well, so get some rest.\nYour further morning self\nwill thank you later,\nlikely in the morning.\nNumber two: Not enjoying\nthe simple moments.\nDo you notice the sweet,\nsimple moments in your life?\nAre you grateful for them?\nSavoring the little moments in your life\nmay make you a bit happier.\nThe practice of savoring\nhas been viewed by many\nto be a way to increase happiness.\nWe can use our thoughts and actions\nto increase our appreciation\nof positive experiences\nand emotions, and the duration of them.\nWhen we do so, this is known as savoring.\nTo practice savoring,\nthe next time you\nappreciate something small,\ntake an extra minute to\nconsciously acknowledge it\nand bask in it.\nDon't let these moments pass\nyou by, be aware of them.\nBecause if we never\nnotice the little moments\nthat are actually more\nspecial than we realize,\nwe may slide into feeling a\nlittle unhappier than we were\nif we had savored them.\nNumber three, never exercising.\nWhen's the last time you\nhit the gym, the treadmill,\na walk, dance, yoga?\nExercise plays a factor in improving\nour self-esteem and happiness.\nContinuous exercise has\nbeen shown to reduce stress,\nanxiety, and symptoms of depression.\nSo it's a good habit to put into place.\nStart with just five minutes\na day when you wake up.\nThen when that becomes a habit,\nadd an extra five minutes.\nContinue doing so until\nyou feel comfortable.\nThe point is, it's easier to start a goal\nof five minutes a day than expect yourself\nto suddenly exercise an hour a day.\nWithout exercise, you'll likely miss out\non a bit of happiness.\nNumber four, ignoring your\nmental and physical wellbeing.\nDo you pay attention\nto your mental health?\nWell, you're watching\nPsych2Go, so hopefully,\nyou're giving your mental wellbeing\na little recognition and motivation.\nBut what about your\nphysical health as well?\nYour life can be filled with busy days\nand constant interruptions,\nbut it's best not to ignore\nyour mental and physical health.\nMost of our health\nproblems will arise later\nrather than sooner if we don't\ntake care of our health now.\nThe National Heart, Lung, and\nBlood Institute recommends\nthat you get your cholesterol measured\nabout once every five years,\nstarting at the age of 20.\nThat's one way you can check\nup on your physical health.\nMental health, know that\nit's okay to take breaks\nwhen overworked or even\non those normal work days.\nA short break can be healthy.\nAnd if you feel overwhelmed\nor emotional, express yourself\nby journaling or talking to someone.\nIt's always best to seek out\nhelp when you feel burnt out,\nfeel outta control, or simply\nneed someone to talk to.\nSo it's best to tend to\nyour health when you can.\nThe long-term results may just\nmake you a little happier.\nNumber five, not progressing.\nIt's great to have a break,\nbut just because you're on one\ndoesn't mean you can't advance\nyour skills somewhere else.\nWhen's the last time you\nlearned something new\nduring your free time?\nLearning can make us feel\nproud, productive, and happy.\nSo why not take up a new hobby?\nAdvance your music skills, read that novel\non your bookshelf, learn a new language.\nThe possibilities are endless.\nYou may think of school as a chore.\nLearning doesn't have to be that way.\nYou can make your own lessons\nand become your own teacher.\nThe topic for today's\nlesson, anything you want.\nJust don't give yourself\ntoo much homework at once,\nand make sure to get some sleep\nso you have enough energy to learn.\nAnd number six, only staying\nin your comfort zone,\ntoo comfortable.\nAre you afraid of what\ncould happen if you fail?\nOf course, everyone considers\nthe possibility of failure.\nBut never taking risks\nis a big life mistake.\nAnd it could lead you down\nsome unhappiness in the future.\nThose who have lived a\nlong life often mention\nhow they wished that\nthey'd taken more risks.\nIn the last years of your life,\nwould you rather have known\nyou took the risk instead\nof living in regret?\nIt's time to get out of your\ncomfort zone and progress.\nIf we always do what makes us comfortable,\nwe may start to feel stuck.\nThe small goals can be easier to notice,\nbut what about those\nexciting long-term goals?\nWe need to explore what else is out there.\nThere may be a new how\nhobby, career, skill,\nrelationship, or journey\nout there for you.\nSo let's get to it.\nWhat things tend to\nmake you a bit unhappy?\nDo you have some exciting new habits\nyou'd like to implement?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go
