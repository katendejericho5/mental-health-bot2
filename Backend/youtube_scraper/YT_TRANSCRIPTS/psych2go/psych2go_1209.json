    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you think of\nyourself as a nice person?\nWhat do you think it is\nthat makes someone nice?\nSome might say humility,\npatience, and consideration,\nwhile others might say it's generosity,\nempathy, and forgiveness.\nThe bottom line is a lot of it has to do\nwith how you treat other people.\nBut what about how you treat yourself?\nWhat if the niceness you show to others\nactually comes at the expense\nof your own happiness and wellbeing?\nSome people might try to take advantage\nof those positive qualities\nand use your good nature against you.\nWorst of all is you might just let them\nbecause you think that's\nwhat nice people do.\nSo with that said,\nhere are eight signs that you're not nice\nbut actually a people pleaser.\nNumber one, you tend to over apologize.\nHas anyone ever said to you\nthat you say sorry too much?\nDo you often find yourself apologizing\nfor things that aren't even\nyour fault or in your control?\nWhile it's certainly an admirable quality\nto be able to own up to your mistakes\nand to take accountability for\nthe things you've done wrong,\nit's also important that\nyou are able to distinguish\nbetween humility and self-blame.\nWhen you apologize over and over again\nwhen there's no reason to,\nor struggle with excessive\nfeelings of guilt,\nthen it's most likely\nthat you've started to confuse being nice\nwith being a people pleaser.\nNumber two, you find it hard to say no.\nJust like knowing when to apologize,\nmany of us were taught at a young age\nthat it's always good to be helpful\nand generous towards others.\nWhat you should also\nkeep in mind, however,\nis that it's also important\nto prioritize your own needs\nand to establish healthy boundaries\nby learning when to say no.\nSo if you're someone who struggles\nto turn down even the\nmost ridiculous of favors,\nsimply out of fear of hurting\nother people's feelings\nor letting them down,\nthen there's a good chance\nyou're probably a people pleaser.\nNumber three, you agree with everyone.\nThink back to the last\ntime someone had asked you\nfor your opinion.\nDid you answer honestly,\neven when you knew they wouldn't agree\nor it would go against what\nother people believed in?\nOr do you tend to just listen\npolitely to those around you\nand keep your thoughts to yourself,\nno matter how much you disagree with them?\nWhile it's certainly polite\nnot to criticize people\nfor things that aren't\nany of our business,\nsuch as their looks,\ntheir weight, and so on,\nit is good and important\nto speak your mind\nwhen it comes to the things\nyou really believe in,\nwhich brings us to our next point.\nNumber four, you change to\nbetter accommodate others.\nDo you hide certain parts of yourself\nwhen you're with people?\nTruth be told, many of us have\nprobably felt the pressure\nto conform and change\nsome aspect of ourselves\nto seem more desirable to others,\nbe it in a romantic context,\nlike to impress your crush,\nor in a social context,\nsuch as to act a certain way\nto fit in with the popular\nkids or to please your parents.\nBut the moment you start\nto lose sight of yourself\nand change too much of who you\nare just to please the people\nin your life, you are\ninadvertently telling yourself\nthat their happiness\nmatters more than yours.\nNumber five, you feel\nuncomfortable with conflict.\nAre you always wondering\nwhether someone is upset\nwith you or not?\nPerhaps you can't stand\nthe thought of anyone,\neven total strangers, being mad at you,\neven for the things you know\nyou are completely justified in.\nA sign that you may be a people pleaser\nis if you're always choosing\nto give in and apologize\nrather than stand up for yourself\nand what you think is right\nbecause you don't know how\nor don't want to deal with conflict.\nIn fact, you may even go to great lengths\nbending over backwards just to avoid it.\nNumber six, you take responsibility\nfor other people's feelings.\nEmpathy can be a very beautiful thing,\nand the ability to put yourself\nin other people's shoes\nis how you're able to understand\nand connect with them deeply.\nBut be careful.\nRemember that you're not responsible\nfor other people's feelings\nand that it's not up to you\nto fulfill their emotional needs.\nDon't make the mistake of doing so\njust because you think\nit's the nice thing to do.\nIt'll only leave you frustrated,\nstressed out, and emotionally drained.\nNumber seven, you constantly\nseek external validation.\nAre you always looking\nfor some kind of approval\nfrom people around you?\nMaybe you never feel good\nabout your accomplishments\nuntil you receive praise\nfrom other people.\nOr perhaps you need kind words\nand appreciation to\naffirm your self-esteem\nand will go to great\nlengths just to get it.\nBut seeking too much external validation\nand defining yourself\nentirely by how others see you\ncan be problematic and self-destructive.\nAfter all, you're going to\nhave to learn sooner or later\nthat you can't please everybody\nand that you can only\nmake yourself truly happy.\nAnd number eight, you don't speak up\nwhen your feelings are hurt.\nLast but certainly not least,\nbeing too much of a people pleaser\nto speak up when other\npeople hurt your feelings\nbecause you think it's not their problem\nor that it might upset them\nis a clear a sign as any\nthat what you're actually\ndoing isn't being nice\nbut that you're being unfair to yourself\njust to make other people happy.\nIn time, if you continue to keep it up,\nyou may end up finding that it'll keep you\nfrom forming authentic\nand mutually satisfying relationships.\nSo do you think you might be guilty\nof being too much of a people pleaser?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe
