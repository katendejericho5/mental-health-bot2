what's\ngreat about you in subtle ways.\nHow will they know you're\ninterested in them?\nWhat will make them wanna\nget to know you more?\nWhat subtle things make\nsomeone start liking you\nas a person?\nWant me to let you in on a secret?\nYou have some pretty\ninteresting and great qualities,\nbut others just don't know about them yet.\nSo to help you with that,\nhere are six tips to make others like you.\nNumber one, ask questions\nto show your interest.\nDo you forget to ask follow-up questions\nto whom you're speaking with?\nYou're in a deep discussion\nand you're definitely interested\nin what they have to say,\nbut how can they know you are?\nSocial psychologist and professor\nat James Madison University, Natalie Kerr,\nwrote in a Psychology Today article\nthat research shows that\npeople who ask more questions\nduring conversations are\nperceived as more responsive\nand are better liked by\nconversation partners.\nA good point indeed.\nWouldn't you get the impression\nthat your friend is actually\ninterested in your story\nif they asked to hear more?\nThe next trick is to actually\nactively listen to them\nand ask follow-up questions\nwhen you're curious about something.\nNumber two, show you're\ntrustworthy and keep your promises.\nAre you trustworthy?\nDo you keep your promises big and small?\nAccording to research,\ntrustworthiness is very\nimportant to others\nwhen it comes to relationships.\nA 2007 research study from researchers\nat the University of Singapore,\nArizona State University,\nand the University of Florida\nfound that trustworthiness\nwas an extremely important\nvalue in relationships\nfor people.\nThe study states, \"Across\ndifferent measures\nof trait importance and different\ngroups and relationships,\ntrustworthiness was\nconsidered extremely important\nfor all interdependent others.\"\nSo next time you make a promise,\nit's a good idea to keep it.\nIt will show others you're trustworthy\nand they may just like\nyou more for that too.\nNumber three, give genuine compliments.\nWhen you think of something\nnice about someone,\ndo you often let them know?\nDo you compliment others\nwhen you get the chance?\nIt may just make someone's day.\nThe reward theory of attraction\nis a good example of how others\nmay start to like you more\nwhen you make them feel better.\nThe theory states that\npeople will like those\nwho they associate rewarding events with.\nOr if your behavior\nmakes them feel rewarded,\nthen they'll like you more for it.\nIf you're often in a good mood\nand in turn make them feel\nbetter, that's a reward.\nIf you don't shy away\nfrom complimenting them\nwhen they've done something\nkind, that's a reward.\nThey'll simply feel\nbetter being around you.\nNumber four, let them know you exist\nand be around them more often.\nDo you want someone to like you?\nWell, they first need to know you exist.\nAccording to the mere-exposure effect,\nthe more we're repeatedly\nexposed to something,\nthe more familiar we become with it\nand people will start\nto prefer the very thing\nthey're more familiar with.\nSo make yourself be heard and seen.\nStay around for those coffee conversations\nduring lunch break,\ninvite some people out to\nan event you're going to,\nlet people develop familiarity with you.\nNumber five, befriend their friends.\nIf you have a shared friend,\nyou already have something in common,\nand perhaps an easier way\nto get to know someone.\nThis is similar to the triadic closure.\nIf there are connections\nA to B and B to C,\nthen there is a likelihood\nof the connection\nfrom A to C to be created as well.\nSo if you really wanna\nbe friends with someone\nand realize you know someone\nthey're friends with,\nlet them know.\nYou'll not only have something\nsimple to both relate to,\nbut you may also have a better\nchance of becoming friends\nwith that person as well.\nAnd number six,\nlet them know you like them\nor enjoy their company.\nHow often do you let\nothers know you like them?\nPeople have an easier time liking someone\nwho likes them back.\nSo let them know you appreciate them.\nLet them know you enjoy their company\nor give them a hug or a\nwave when you see them next.\nThey'll have an easier time liking someone\nwho they know genuinely\nappreciates and likes them back.\nWouldn't you wanna know if they liked you?\nSo which tips will you use\nwhen making new friends?\nHow will you let others\nknow you appreciate them?\nWill you give out genuine compliments\nwhen you think of them?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go
