    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Daydreams are normally\nmini poofs of happy, breath\nof fresh air what-ifs,\na brain micro vacation.\nYes, we've thought of what we'd do\nwith the bazillion dollars\nwe won from the lottery too.\nHowever, when the balance\nof daydream and reality tips\nso that your real life\nis seriously disrupted\nor even rejected,\nthe daydreams have\nturned to the dark side,\nbecoming maladaptive.\nMaladaptive daydreaming\nis an extreme escapism coping mechanism,\nusually in response to\ntrauma, abuse, or loneliness.\nIt can be an addiction\nand a sign to seek professional assistance\nas it's commonly found in\nthose with mental health issues\nlike PTSD, anxiety, or\nobsessive-compulsive disorder.\nHere are a few ways you can tell\nif that dragon riding trip you took\nafter winning a mighty\nbattle is a normal daydream\nor heading towards maladaptive.\nNumber one.\nDaydreaming blackouts.\nWe all have somewhat of an internal clock.\nSure, some are more accurate than others,\nbut we all usually have an inkling\nof a few minutes or a few seconds.\nWith daydreams, we can usually tell\nour mind's drifted off for a few moments.\nAt most, you imagined a\nlittle story in your head\nfor what felt like one minute,\nbut you're not too surprised\nif you see it was actually three or four.\nWe then shake off the\ndaydream and get back to life.\nIn the maladaptive daydream,\nyou essentially lose real-life time.\nYour internal clock just turns right off\nand you get so engrossed in the daydream\nthat you're living your life in your head,\nhaving no sense of the real world.\nIt could be morning\nand by the time something\npulls you back to reality,\nyou could be looking at the\ndarkened sky and wondering,\n\"Where did the day go?\"\nNumber two.\nExtremely vivid daydreams.\nDaydreams, just like nighttime dreaming,\nusually have that soft edge,\ncloudy feel about them.\nIf you picture it, you can\ndefinitely tell it was a dream.\nIf you talk to someone else\nabout it, you might say,\n\"So I had this idea that...\"\nOr, \"I was just thinking\nhow great it would be if...\"\nMaladaptive daydreams are\nrecalled far more vividly,\nsharply, and viscerally.\nIn fact, they feel so real\nthat they could be mistaken\nfor a real-life memory,\nwhich is why it can be helpful\nto have something else for backup\nto ensure that you're\nremembering actually happened,\nlike an associated activity or\na physical piece of evidence\nlike a receipt.\nBonus tip.\nThis can help you discern\nif you're getting gaslit\nor if you should increase your self-care\nwith your doctor's guidance.\nNumber three.\nLiving the daydream out loud.\nSit back for a quick second\nand imagine what you'd say\nif you had a chance to run\ninto your favorite celebrity.\nDid you half-smile,\nmaybe raise your eyebrow at the thought?\nThat's normal\nand we bet it was at least a\nlittle bit fun to imagine that.\nAnd now you're outta the daydream.\nIn fact, while you were\nimagining the scenario,\nyou still knew where you were for real.\nIf you were maladaptive daydreaming,\nsomeone in the same space as you\nmay have observed you talking out loud,\npacing or making motions\nlike you were interacting\nwith the invisible person.\nYou were so into the fantasy\nthat the ability to tell the difference\nbetween that and reality was lost.\nSo you just started living\nthe dream literally.\nNumber four.\nThe daydreaming evicts night\ndreaming, we mean insomnia.\nMaladaptive daydreaming can\nplay a big part in not sleeping.\nThe daydreams and fantasy scenarios\nbecome so obsessively engrossing\nthat it keeps the part of\nyour brain associated with it\nturned on and awake,\ninstead of letting it rest,\nlike it normally would at bedtime.\nEven worse, the insomniac brain\ncan have trouble properly\nturning on the regions\ncritical to the ability to focus\nand concentrate for working memory.\nThis makes it even easier\nto slip into daydream mode,\nnot a good cycle.\nImproving sleep can help somewhat\nand there are entire\nstudies, labs, and regimens\nthat could help.\nJust look under sleep hygiene.\nAnd number five, lucid daydreaming.\nWhen exiting out of a normal daydream,\ngenerally, you give yourself\na little mental nudge\nto shake off the soft\nfocus camera in your head.\nYou are back to the humdrum work meeting\nand you might quickly whisper\nto someone next to you,\n\"Uh, what did the manager just say?\",\nhaving realized you didn't\nreally listen to them\nfor the last 60 seconds.\nBasically, you know you are\ndaydreaming, you're now back,\nand you just wanna catch\nup on what you missed.\nMaladaptive daydreams\nare more like being stuck in\nthe matrix and you're not Neo,\nbut you might be one of the crew members.\nYou know you're in the daydream,\nbut you don't know how\nto get back in touch\nwith the operator to get back to the real\nor are you in the real already?\nWhat's real and isn't real\ndoesn't have a clear division\nfor the maladaptive daydreamer.\nThis is distressing\nas they just aren't sure\nwhat they can trust.\nDaydreams are normal\nand can keep us from becoming\noverly tense or snapping.\nThey can even be useful,\nhelping us plan events\nor giving a little\njuice to our creativity.\nWhen daydreams go bad, though,\nwe need to turn to self-care.\nAs the saying goes,\n\"Check yourself before\nyou wreck yourself.\"\nAnd maybe have a\nprofessional do the checking.\nHave you noticed any of\nthese things with yourself\nor with others?\nHow has it affected you?\nWe welcome your insights and comments.\nYour life might not always\nbe cupcakes and unicorns,\nbut it's real, which makes\nit that much more precious.\nSo stop daydreaming, give us a\nlike, and we'll see you soon."
