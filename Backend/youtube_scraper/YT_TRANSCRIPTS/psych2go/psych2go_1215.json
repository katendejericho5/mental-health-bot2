    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Is there someone\nyou like at the moment?\nWhen you're attracted to somebody\nyou may spend half of your\ntime fantasizing about them\nand the other half wondering\nif they like you back.\nAnd if the idea of asking them directly\nsounds too overwhelming and stressful,\nyou could try to look for subtle\nor sometimes not so subtle clues,\nsuch as verbal or non-verbal communication\nto find your answer.\nHere are five of the common\nsigns you could look out for.\nNumber 1, you can't look\naway from each other.\nDo you always catch yourself\nlocking eyes with them?\nPerhaps you tend to look at each other\nfrom across the room or\nsteal small shy glances\nwhen you're next to each other.\nThe effects of mutual eye contact\non feelings of romantic love\nhave been studied for a long time now.\nA classic study going as far as 1989,\nfound that staring into someone's eyes\ncan increase your feelings towards them.\nThe participants in that experiment\nwere randomly paired with strangers\nand tasked to gaze into each\nother's eyes for some time.\nAfter filling a survey\nthey found that the\ncouples who participated\nin mutual eye contact\nreported feelings of affection and liking.\nSo it's a good sign if you and your crush\ncan't seem to take your\neyes off each other.\nNumber 2, you find excuses to touch.\nThere's nothing better than accidentally\ntouching the hand of\nsomeone you secretly like.\nYour fingers meet for a moment\nand all you can think about\nis how it would feel to\nactually hold their hand.\nWell, when the attraction is mutual,\nyou may notice that\nyou aren't the only one\ntrying to sneak in some\nskin to skin contact,\nwhether it's casually putting\ntheir hand on your shoulder\nor walking so close to you,\nthat your elbows touch,\nfinding chances to be close to each other\nis a good sign that they like you too.\nNumber 3, you are texting nonstop.\nImagine this.\nIt's late at night,\nyou're laying in your bed\nready to sleep,\nbut you started a conversation\nwith your crush hours ago\nand you just can't make\nyourself go to sleep\nwhile they're on the other\nside of the screen texting you.\nAnd at this point, it's\nclear you like them,\nbut you can take it as a sign\nthat they like you just as much too.\nWhy else would they\nstay up talking to you?\nAnd if you find that the conversation\ndoesn't end after you fall asleep,\nthat they text you the next morning\nwith a good morning or send\nyou a funny meme they saw\nand hoped you'd like,\nthen it's clear that you\ncan't get enough of each other\nand that you're both just\nfinding creative excuses\nto keep in touch all the time.\nNumber 4, you shower each\nother with compliments.\nDoes your crush have something nice to say\nabout you almost every time you meet them?\nAnd do you tend to take that opportunity\nto compliment them back\nwithout sounding pushy?\nGiving compliments\ndoesn't automatically mean\nthat you like that person.\nOftentimes, you may compliment others\njust to be nice and polite,\nbut flirtatious complimenting\nis completely different from that.\nThis comes from the heart and\nit happens much more often\nthan just being nice.\nOn top of that, when two\npeople like each other\nthey also tend to get\nmore deep and creative\nwith their compliments.\nFor example, while, \"Nice shirt,\"\nis not a bad compliment,\nit can't beat someone saying,\n\"You're such a wonderful person,\"\nor, \"I really like hanging out with you,\nbecause you're so fun.\"\nSo if you find that you\nboth tend to give each other\nendless compliments,\nthen there's definitely\nsome chemistry between you.\nAnd number 5, people around you tease you.\nWhen it comes to having a crush,\nyou may sometimes think that\nyou're doing really well\nat hiding your feelings,\nbut more times than\nnot it's pretty obvious\nto the people around you\nthat there are some sparks going on.\nThey might notice you\nglancing at each other,\nblushing or acting a little bit nervous\nwhen you are together.\nAnd when they notice, they\nmight start teasing you\nin a good way of course,\nby saying things like,\n\"You're such a cute couple,\"\nor, \"Are you gonna admit you're together?\"\nWhile you may tell them that\nthey're outta their minds,\nsecretly, you're hoping the same thing.\nDo some of these signs\ndescribe your relationship\nwith the person you like?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to Like, Subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified.\nWhenever Psych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching and\nsee you in our next video."
