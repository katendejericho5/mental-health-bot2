    "transcript": "- [Narrator] What do you think of\nwhen you hear the word mania?\nAccording to a book\nwritten by a sociologist,\nJohn Alan Lee, called \"Colours of Love\",\nmania is a type of love that is described\nas a possessive or obsessive love\nthat can lead to extreme\njealousy and codependency.\nMania is caused by an imbalance\nof love and insecurities\nby two people.\nBut the good news is\neven if you find yourself\nin one of these styles of\nlove that Lee describes,\nyou won't stay there forever.\nPeople ebb and flow in and\nout of these styles of love.\nNow let's explore six signs\nyou might be experiencing obsessive love.\nNumber one, lack of\nconcentration and focus.\nHave you ever found yourself\nlosing focus on your tasks\nbecause you're constantly\nthinking about your partner?\nThis could be a sign that you\nare experiencing obsession.\nThe person experiencing this type of love\noften concentrates all\nof their time and energy\non that other person.\nThey may feel lost without them,\nfeel like part of them\nhas been ripped apart,\nfeel like they can't be\nthemselves without them and more.\nAccording to researchers\nin the field of sociology and psychology\nwho have researched these types of love,\nthese feelings could be\nrelated to codependency\nwhich brings us to\nnumber two, codependency.\nIf your mood, happiness and identity\nis defined by another person,\nthen you could be in a\ncodependent relationship,\nstates in Everyday Health\narticle about codependency.\nAccording to the article,\nif you find it difficult to make decisions\nin a relationship,\nidentify your feelings and communicate,\nperhaps you have fears of abandonment,\na sense of responsibility\nfor the actions of others,\nhave an unhealthy\ndependence on relationships,\npoor self-esteem and you\nvalue the approval of others\nover your own, then you're codependent.\nIn a codependent relationship,\nusually, there is one partner\nthat can't make decisions\nand the other partner revels\nin making the decisions for them.\nCodependency is part of\nthe mania love dynamic.\nNumber three, you don't feel good\nwhen you don't get\nattention from your partner.\nHow do you feel when your partner\nis not interacting with you?\nNormal, worried, angsty, void?\nIf you get extreme, negative emotions\nthat are related to attention,\nthis may be a sign of mania.\nThese feelings can be\nmanifested in wanting to talk\nor text with your partner all the time,\ngetting sad, feeling desperate\nor worried if they don't\nrespond right away,\nthinking that they're ignoring you,\ndon't love you anymore,\nor are avoiding you if a few hours\nor a day goes by without\nthem answering you.\nYou may also feel a void or emptiness\nwhen you know that you can't\ncommunicate with them anymore,\nlike when they go to sleep.\nThese are part of the\nemotions and reactions\nthat characterize the love style of mania\naccording to J.A. Lee.\nNumber four, extreme jealousy.\nExtreme jealousy can come in many forms\nfrom just being insecure\nor becoming aggressive\nand getting physical.\nOne of the things that\nextreme jealousy causes\nis the inability to relax due to the fact\nthat you're often thinking about\nwhether or not your partner\nis cheating on you.\nIt can also create problems\nin the relationship\nlike lack of trust, shouting and abuse.\nJealousy that is taken too\nfar will sever and damage\nthe relationship completely.\nAccording to an article on Verywell Mind,\nunhealthy jealousy is rooted\nin fear of abandonment\nand a worry about not being truly loved.\nThis is why the person acts out\nby aggressively questioning their partner,\nfeeling paranoid, trying\nto control their partner,\nviolating personal space\nand privacy among others.\nIf you're dealing with\nfeelings of extreme jealousy\nand can't seem to solve them on your own,\nwe advise that you contact a mental\nor relationship and\nmarriage counselor near you.\nNumber five, extreme possessiveness.\nOftentimes, extreme jealousy\nleads to extreme possessiveness\nin an attempt to control\nand keep your partner close.\nPossessiveness can look like breaking\nthe partner's boundaries,\nintruding in their personal space,\ntrying to control who they see or talk to,\ntrying to control how they dress,\ntheir outings, what they eat,\nbreaking into their phone,\nblaming, guilt tripping,\nmanipulating them,\nnot letting them go out\nwithout you and more.\nLisa Firestone, a clinical psychologist,\nstates that acting possessive\nwill work to cut ties with them.\nAccording to her,\nexercising power over your partner\nactually diminishes your\nown attraction to them.\nPossessiveness leads to lower\nrelationship satisfaction\nand deteriorates it.\nIn the end, if the\nbehavior is not stopped,\nit will culminate at the\nend of the relationship\nand result in two wounded people.\nAnd number six, desperately\nneeding your partner.\nHave you ever felt overly needy\nor desperate to be with your partner?\nIt can feel like a constant grappling\nor different sensations on your chest\nthat sometimes lead to panic attacks.\nExperts relate this mainly to\nabandonment and lost wounds\nthat make you feel the need\nfor your partner constantly,\nkeeping them from going\nout to do simple errands\nto needing them near you\nin order to fall asleep.\nPeople also do this to\nfind a sense of value\nthat they cannot find within themselves.\nThey need to be valued by the other person\nin order to feel good about themselves\nbut demanding too much of your partner\nbecause of your need for them\ncan leave both of you drained\nand strain your relationship.\nDid you relate to any of these?\nThe best ways to avoid\nmania are to recognize\nobsessive or possessive behavior\nbefore acting it out.\nLearn how to focus on\nyourself and your goals more\nthan on another person\nand learn how to build and put\ntrust in your relationships.\nIt's always a good idea\nto reach out to a mental\nor relationship and marriage professional\nif you think you need help\nor suspect that something\nis harming your relationship\nbut you can't seem to fix it\nyourself or figure it out.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching and see you next time."
