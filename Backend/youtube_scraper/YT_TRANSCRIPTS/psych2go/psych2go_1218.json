    "transcript": "hey psyched goers\nwe understand family is important and we\nget it that parenthood can have its\nchallenges we're here to try to give you\na helping hand by providing some\ninformation but please don't take any of\nthis personally moms are great\nrather they can be great but we know\nthat some mother and child relationships\naren't so great\nmaybe you're worrying about whether you\nare or are going to be that good mom or\nmaybe you're the child who wants to\nanalyze the kind of relationship that\nyou have with your mother and what\nimpact it's had\neither or let's take a look at five\nkinds of unhealthy mother child\nrelationships to watch out for and\nplease note that these refer to the\nchild as being prior to adulthood\nnumber one bosom buddies\nshe's my best friend i'm not a dictator\nhave you heard someone seriously\nproclaim that their child mother\nrelationship is one where they're bffs\nrather than parent and child\non the surface it sounds good right\nthe reality if that's truly what it is\nnot so much\nthis kind of relationship is egalitarian\nmeaning neither party has authority over\nthe other this means nobody is in charge\nthe mother is exhibiting a permissive\nparenting style that's not healthy and\nhas negative long-term repercussions\nwherein sharing secrets from child to\nparent have shown to result in higher\nquality relationships and a lower\nlikelihood of delinquency the mother\nburdening the child with things like\npersonal problems and economic strains\nhas shown detriment to the child what\ncan be concluded based on these findings\nbuilding intimacy with your child does\nnot mean wholly dumping your personal\nand emotional problems onto them a\nmother can still share a small dosage of\nher own mental life with her children\nbut not to the extent of distressing\nthem it should be just enough to help\nthem learn and understand mom as a human\nnumber two boss and subordinate\nbefore we talked about no one in charge\nthis is swinging the pendulum way to the\nother side where mom is constantly a\nmicromanaging dictator the typical\nscenario the child wants to go on a trip\nthey ask mom and have outlined all the\nsafety measures and all the educational\nmental and recreational benefits sounds\ngolden and yet the response is\nno i've decided what you're going to do\nand it's this thing that i have decided\nthe child reiterates the benefits\npleading their case yet the answer is\nstill\nno this is my final decision this is for\nyou and your own good mother knows best\nwatching psycho and bates motel we can\nsee this is not a precursor to healthy\nthings the micromanaging spawns feelings\nof inadequacy and despite sharing this\nwith mom she's dismissive and forces her\nroles and expectations as law since only\nshe can possibly know what's good for\nyou your words and choices have zero\nvalidity if this is constant without any\ngive this leads to the child feeling\ninsecure and helpless they may suffer\nfrom low self-esteem and be very fearful\nof rejection possibly to the detriment\nof any future choices\nnumber three the role reversal\nrelationship\nthe entire role of a mother is to raise\ncare for and protect the child because\nas non-adults they do not have the fully\nformed mental or emotional capacity\nequipped to care for themselves or\nothers\nyet this is exactly what happens in the\nrole reversal relationship also known as\nparentification\nan unfortunate but realistic scenario is\nwhen there is the divorce and the child\nis nowhere near adulthood but is old\nenough to perform basic functions the\nmother starts acting consistently\nreckless irresponsible and maybe even\nviolent\nsince mom is no longer being mom\nthe needs of the child for comfort\nattention and guidance must all be\nsacrificed so they can fulfill the\nlogistical and emotional needs of the\nmother\na parentified child has to bear the\nresponsibility of becoming a parent to\nmom because the latter neglects their\nown parental role psychotherapist dr\nsamuel lopez de victoria notes there are\ntwo types of parentification\nemotional and instrumental let's start\nwith emotional this is the most\ndestructive type of parentification the\nchild is forced to meet the emotional\nand psychological needs of the parent\nthe mother doesn't get these needs\nfulfilled from her partner so she forces\nthis confidante role on the child with\ninstrumental the child is expected to be\na tool the child is forced to be an\nadult caregiver by taking over the\nphysical responsibilities of the parent\nto near exclusion of being able to be a\nkid an example is having to constantly\ncook and raise their siblings since\ntheir parent is not doing it\nthe fallout is that the grown-up\nparentified child may experience\ndifficulty building a healthy connection\nwith their friends spouse or their own\nchildren\nnumber four\nthe emotionally absent mother so how are\nthings with your mom is she distant\npreoccupied or only consistent in her\ninconsistency regarding your emotional\nneeds\nyou just might have an emotionally\nabsent mother\nuk psychologist dr becky spellman notes\nthat a mother can intuit their child's\nemotions and respond appropriately to\nsuit them if they're uneasy like a warm\nhug for example\nwhen a mother is emotionally absent she\nlacks the empathy to meet the child's\nemotional needs\ncognitive development starts at around\nage five and it's around this time the\nchild might notice the mother ignores\nthem despite their efforts to engage\nwith her\nthe message they get is that engaging is\nuseless so they start to suppress their\nemotions which can become a precursor to\nmental health issues such as eating\ndisorders and other types of addictions\nfurther down the road in adulthood it\ncan also impact intimate relationships\nwhere they choose partners who are just\nas absent as the parent was\nthey may also become closed off because\nof the heightened fear of rejection they\nexperienced as children\nand number five\nthe mom and her trophy child\nsometimes a mother may have unrealized\ndreams or wishes so she uses her child\nas a surrogate to do what she couldn't\nher child becomes an extension of\nherself known as narcissistic appendage\nthe child is no longer an individual\nunto themselves but an object to be\nshined up and shown off to others to\nengender envy status and symbolize\nsuccess\nit's all about what the mother wants for\nherself\nthe child soon learns to discard their\nauthentic self in order to conform to\nwhat the mother wants them to do\nthe relationship built between a mother\nand child is complex fluid and usually\naffected by the environment the\nemotional and psychological state of the\nmother personalities and the mother's\nown upbringing\nto paraphrase a quote by bj neblet who\nwe are is made up of our experiences and\nresponses to all we have encountered as\nlife does not stand still those\nexperiences continue to ripple through\nour lives and affect us both good and\nbad\na healthy mother-in-child dynamic can be\nachieved if the mother is self-aware and\nself-reflective this allows the mother\nto behave authentically with their\naspirations which in turn leads to the\npositive growth of the child\ninformation from this video has been\nbased on
