    "transcript": "- Hi Psych2Go community.\nWe started almost five years ago\nwith the mission of making psychology\nand mental wellness topics\nmore accessible, educational\nand entertaining to everyone\nthrough our animated videos.\nIt's been a beautiful,\nyet challenging ride.\nWe hate to say it, but we're\ncurrently struggling a bit\nto stay relevant, to\ncontinue making innovative,\nnew topics that we haven't\nalready covered before.\nAnd we hate to be repetitive.\nSo if there are any topics\nthat you would like us to cover next\nor be part of something greater,\nplease comment something as simple as hi,\njust to let us know that\nyou're still around.\nWe feel so fortunate to\nhave potentially been able\nto impact each of you at some\npoint in time in your lives\nand so glad that you're still\nwith us watching this video.\nTo those of you who have\nbeen watching our content\nand plan to keep with us on this journey,\nthank you so much.\nTo those of you who\nhave shared our content,\nwe are so grateful.\nIt really makes a difference.\nAnd to those of you who have newly joined,\nwe are honored to spend\nthis time with you.\nWe won't let you down.\nOh, and I'm Amanda, the\nvoiceover for the channel.\nSo thank you just for everything."
