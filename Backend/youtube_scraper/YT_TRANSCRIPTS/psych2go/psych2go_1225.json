    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever\nhad a traumatic experience\nin your life?\nEven if you've never been in an accident,\nhad your life threatened or\nbeen in serious physical danger,\nthe answer can still be, yes.\nA traumatic experience\ncan refer to any situation\nthat evokes an intense, overwhelming\nand long lasting sense of\nfear, anxiety, and stress.\nEmotional and psychological trauma\nis something unfortunately,\na lot of people go through.\nIf left unresolved, trauma in any form\ncan manifest in negative\ncognitive, behavioral,\nor even physiological ways.\nHere are seven signs\nthat you're not broken\nbut maybe struggling with\nsome unhealed trauma.\nNumber one, you are in\na toxic relationship.\nMany people are uncomfortable\nwith seeking help\nor reaching out about toxic relationships.\nThis is most likely because\nwhile it may be easy to spot\ntoxic relationships from afar,\nit's a lot harder to do\nup close and personal,\nespecially with our own\nfeelings clouding our judgment\nand living with the emotional baggage\na toxic relationship brings\ncan lead to a lot of problematic behaviors\nthat make it more\ndifficult for us to connect\nwith other people\nin a healthy, meaningful,\nand emotionally intimate way.\nNumber two, you suffered\na significant loss.\nAnother reason why a\nlot of people may suffer\nfrom psychological trauma\nis if they have recently experienced\na significant loss in their lives\nthat they don't know how to deal with.\nGrief if left unresolved\ncan lead us who become more\ndetached and isolate ourselves\nfrom those around us.\nIt may make it more difficult to sleep,\nconcentrate or think clearly,\nand it could lead us to become moodier\nand emotionally volatile,\nprone to lashing out or breaking down\nover seemingly nothing.\nNumber three, you have certain triggers.\nEven if you feel that you already moved on\nfrom your difficult past,\nunresolved trauma may still\nlinger in your subconscious\nand form triggers.\nTriggers are defined\nas provocative content,\nimages or speech\nthat evokes an immediate emotional\nor psychological response\nsuch as panic, anxiety, stress,\ntension, dissociation,\nor extreme discomfort.\nSo when you feel triggered by things\nthat you may or may not associate\nwith a traumatic event in your life,\nthen there's most likely\nstill some unhealed trauma\nblocking your path\ntowards mental, physical,\nand emotional wellbeing.\nNumber four, you have\nunexplained symptoms.\nSimilar to the last point,\nunexplained somatic\nsymptoms are our mind's way\nof telling us while we\nmight think nothing's wrong,\nwe might still be harboring\nsome psychological wounds\nthat need tending to.\nSo if you've been having symptoms lately\nthat you or your doctor just can't explain\nsuch as migraines, muscle tension,\nbody aches, insomnia, loss of appetite,\nmemory loss, difficulty concentrating,\nfatigue, low energy,\nand depressive effect,\nyou might be better off\nspeaking to a therapist about it\nthan a physician.\nAll these are common in\npatient suffering from PTSD.\nNumber five, you struggle\nwith emotional intimacy.\nDo you find it difficult\nto open up and trust\neven your closest friends\nand family members?\nDo you struggle to maintain\nclose long-term relationships\nin your life?\nOr feel uncomfortable\nexpressing your true feelings\nto others?\nThis fear of emotional\nintimacy and vulnerability\nmay stem from a previous\ntraumatic experience in your life\nthat you've not yet come to terms with.\nAfter all, trauma has the power to impact\nnot only how we feel about ourselves,\nbut also how we relate to other people.\nNumber six, you suffer from\nfeelings of depression.\nAlthough many people\nmight not be aware of it,\nthere's a difference\nbetween feeling depressed\nand being depressed.\nIn certain situations,\nsuch as following the\ndeath of a loved one,\na major event, illness,\ninjury, and so on,\nit's perfectly normal to\nwrestle with such feelings.\nSo if you find yourself feeling depressed\nafter having experienced\na traumatic event,\nno matter how long ago it may have been,\nthen it might be your\nmind's way of telling you\nthat something's not right,\nand that there are still some\nissues you've left unresolved.\nAnd number seven, you have\nunhealthy coping mechanisms.\nLast but certainly not least,\neven if you feel that\nnone of the things we've talked\nabout so far apply to you,\nif you have any unhealthy\ncoping mechanisms\nfor your personal problems,\nthen it's a good sign\nthat you're still struggling\nwith some unhealed trauma.\nAlcoholism, substance abuse,\ngambling, overspending,\nover eating, withdrawing\nsocially, and self-harming\nare just a few of the\nmost common examples.\nOftentimes we turn to these\nproblematic coping mechanisms\nwhen we don't want to acknowledge\nor don't know how to process\nwhat it is we're feeling\nand what to do about it.\nSo do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nPlease, don't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental healthcare professional\nso you can better understand your trauma\nand how it's affecting your life.\nHealing from trauma takes time,\nbut seeking help is the\nfirst step towards recovery.\n(gentle music)"
