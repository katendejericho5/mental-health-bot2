    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Do you have a crush,\nand you are trying to figure\nout how to best tell them\nthat you like them\nwithout sounding creepy?\nWell, here are some tips\non how to show your crush you like them\nwithout sounding creepy.\nNumber one, hint that you like them first.\nDo you talk to your crush?\nOr have you been watching\nthem from afar in your class?\nThey know you a bit,\nmaybe as an acquaintance,\nbut you don't often speak to them.\nBefore you jump right towards\nrevealing that you like them,\nyou may wanna hint at it first.\nThis is especially true\nif you don't know them all that well.\nTry flirting with them a bit\nor increasing your eye contact,\nas long as you're not creepily staring.\nMaybe you can compliment\nthem a a few times\nwhile making eye contact and smiling.\nIf you've been texting them or\ntalking through social media,\ntry flirting a bit there\nbefore revealing how you feel about them.\nThis way, they have a chance\nto think about how they feel about you\nas a potential romantic partner first.\nNumber two,\nchoose to tell them in a\nlocation that's comfortable.\nStill nervous?\nTry choosing a comfortable\nlocation to tell them.\nYou don't wanna tell them in\nan overly crowded location\nwhere you have to yell\nfor them to hear you.\n\"I like you!\" Awkward.\nWell, at least you let them know.\nBut try to choose a\nlocation that's comfortable\nto the both of you,\nand maybe one that's more\nprivate or away from close ears,\nyou'll both have an easier time talking\nand revealing such personal details\nsuch as your feelings for one another.\nNumber three, look to the\npositive and be respectful.\nWhen telling your crush,\nyou wanna be respectful\nduring all parts of the conversation.\nBeforehand, don't dwell\non what could go wrong.\nPositive things can happen too.\nTry your best to stay confident,\neven if they don't feel\nthe same way about you.\nAnd if they do reject you,\nbe respectful and accept\ntheir decision and feelings.\nNumber four, practice what you'll say\nand ask friends for their thoughts.\nIf you're still a bit nervous,\nperhaps practice what you're\ngoing to say in advance\nin your mind.\nWill you talk about\nhow you've enjoyed\nspending time with them,\nthen reveal your feelings?\nWill you let them know you like them\nby asking them out on a date?\nYou could also ask trusted friends\nfor their thoughts as well.\nHey, you never know. Your\nfriend could be a wingman.\nNumber five, be yourself\nwhen you tell them.\nYou don't wanna try to\nbe someone you're not\nwhen asking them.\nDon't go for polar opposite personality\nwhen asking them out.\nDon't be untruthful in order\nto appear more attractive.\nSimply be genuine,\nrespectful, and yourself.\nYou're going to want your crush\nto like you for who you are.\nOtherwise, they'll end\nup liking, or not liking,\nwhoever you're trying to be.\nAnd that person doesn't exist.\nSo it's best to be yourself.\nAnd number six, remember it's\nnot as important as you think.\nWhile it can seem like\nan extremely major event,\nletting your crush know you like them\nis something many people do\nand it's not always as\nimportant as it may seem.\nIf they do say no, you'll one day move on.\nIf they say yes, perhaps\nthey like you as well,\nyou'll maybe realize it\nwas worth telling them,\nbut not something to be so worried about.\nThey'll either wanna\ngo out with you or not.\nEither way, you'll both continue on.\nIf you can, take a deep breath,\nrelax, and simply tell them how you feel.\nSo, will you ask your crush out?\nLet them know how you feel?\nIf you don't, will you regret it?\nIt's a good idea to be honest, respectful,\nand true to yourself.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did,\ndon't forget to click the like button,\ncomment, and share this\nvideo with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching.\n(chill music)"
