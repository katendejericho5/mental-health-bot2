    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever wondered\nif someone's attracted to you\nand you don't even realize it?\nIt can sometimes be hard to tell\nunless someone is obvious\nabout their interest\nbecause attraction typically appears first\non the micro level.\nIt's important to first\ndecipher if the person\nmight simply be a highly\neffective communicator\nwith a high social IQ\nwho is adept at making\npeople feel seen and heard\nwith their attentiveness.\nOn the contrary,\npeople who are attracted to\nyou might send mixed signals,\nespecially if someone is anxious\naround someone they're attracted to.\nSo for all these signs,\nplease use your intuition\nto decipher the clues.\nDisclaimer: this video is\nfor educational purposes\nand is based on personal opinions.\nThis video is not a substitute\nfor professional advice\nbut for a general guidance.\nWe advise you to always\nlisten to your intuition\nand always do what is right for you.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, mirroring behavior.\nAccording to clinical\npsychologist Holly Schiff,\nmirroring is when someone\nsubconsciously attempts\nto bond with you through\nmatching your behavior.\nIf you notice someone\nis making the similar\nfacial expressions as you,\nplacing their body in a similar posture,\nor even matching your energy levels,\nthey may find your\npresence attractive enough\nto express their interests\nthrough this nonverbal affirmation.\nNote that most people aren't likely\nto consciously catch themselves doing so.\nBut if you start to notice your date\nis matching your standing\nposture and speech mannerisms,\nit's a great sign of attraction.\nIt's also why couples\ntend to start looking\nand acting similar after some time.\nNumber two, physical flirtation.\nPeople who have physical\ntouch as their love language\nmight throw in some physical flirtation\nto show their interest in you\nsuch as a lingering hug, a\npat on your arm or shoulder,\naccidentally grazing your hand,\ntouching the mid to\nlower part of your back.\nTake notice of whether they\nseem communicative with everyone\nwith their physical touch,\nor if it's only you that\nthey are extra attentive to\nin this form.\nSome people may use physical\ntouch as a bonding technique\nto help themselves and\nothers feel more comfortable\nin their presence.\nSo it could be that they'd be\nnervous about acting that way\ntowards someone they're attracted to.\nNumber three, belly button alignment.\nMargaret Stone, a licensed\ntherapist and dating coach,\nstates that aligning one's\nbelly button with another\nis a sign of attraction,\ntrust, and security,\nsomething which is also\ndone subconsciously.\nCouples who tend to face each other,\neven one in large groups,\nare doing so to feel socially\nsafe on a subconscious level.\nSimilarly, when someone\nis attracted to you,\ntheir body will give clues\nthat they'd like to become closer to you\nphysically or emotionally\nby pointing themselves directly to you.\nOr when someone is\nengaging in conversation,\ntheir feet may point\ntowards the person they're speaking with\nthat they're interested in.\nNumber four, open body language.\nIn a 2016 study on the\nimportance and impact\nof body language on speed dating,\nresearchers found that participants\nwho displayed open non-verbal\nbehavior were deemed\nas dominant and attractive\nversus those who demonstrated\ncontractive cues.\nWhile it's now considered\nscientifically proven\nthat open body language\nlike uncrossing your arms,\ntaking up space, and standing\nwith a straight posture\ncan make you seem more attractive,\nit's also true that those\nwho are attracted to you\nwill appear more open in\ntheir body language as well.\nIf they're keeping their bodies vulnerable\nand in a welcoming stance,\nthey feel comfortable and safe around you.\nOn the other hand,\nif they seem to be closed\noff with their body,\nit might be their way of\nnonverbally asking for some space.\nNumber five, eyebrow flash.\nThis one might be hard to\nnotice, but if you do catch it,\ntake it as a good sign.\nAn eyebrow flash or an eyebrow raise\nis considered a micro expression,\nwhich means it only\nappears on a person's face\nfor a split second.\nMicro expressions are\nthe most telling signs\nof someone's true emotions,\neven when their words or\nconscious actions say otherwise.\nA quick raising of the eyebrows,\nespecially when someone first\nsees you walking towards them,\nfor example, could be expressing\ntheir genuine excitement\nthat you've arrived.\nContrast that with eyes that narrow\nwith downward turning eyebrows\nwhen someone is unhappy to see you.\nStrangers who find you\nattractive while walking past you\nmight quickly flash their\neyebrows as a subtle sign\nof surprise or delight\nin what they're seeing.\nBut note that an eyebrow\nraise that remains raised\nmight be less attraction\nand more surprise or shock.\nNumber six, voice changes.\nEver notice your best friend's voice\nbecoming suddenly higher or deeper\nwhile in the company of they're crush?\nWell, don't judge them for it.\nBecause it's quite likely that\nyou unconsciously do the same\nin the presence of someone\nyou are attracted to as well.\nA study conducted in 2014 found\nthat people speaking to\nsomeone they find attractive\ntend to change the tone, strength,\nand pitch of their voice when doing so.\nAccording to the study,\nit's even possible for those\nlistening in on conversations\nbetween two people who are\nattracted to each other\nto tell there's chemistry happening.\nTake note of how someone sounds\nwhen speaking to a\nfamily member or a friend\nversus when they're speaking with you.\nThey might seem more attentive\nin their speech style\nand desire to highlight\ntheir best qualities\nthrough their voice.\nFor example, if they'd like for you\nto believe they're masculine,\nthey might deepen their voice.\nAnd if they want you\nto think they're sweet,\nthey might soften their voice.\nNumber seven, inward leaning.\nJack Schaffer PhD states\nthat as rapport increases\nbetween two people, inward\nleaning may increase as well.\nThis happens gradually and\nwill often include signs\nof belly button alignment\nand open body language.\nThis might be easier to tell\nwhen involved in a one-on-one\nconversation than in a group.\nThe best plan of action is to first notice\nif someone is making frequent\neye contact with you.\nAnd if you reciprocate,\nthey begin to turn their body towards you\nand inevitably lean in,\nespecially if they're seated.\nTake this as a positive sign\nthat they are interested in\nor attracted to you.\nOn the other hand,\nthose who aren't interested\nin the topic at hand\nor seem confusingly indifferent\nto your impossibly good looks and charm\nmight lean back and keep\nthemselves at a distance instead.\nAnd number eight, distracted behavior.\nMaybe you're noticing your\ncrush seems more distracted\nin one-on-one study sessions with you\nthan when in a group setting.\nOr perhaps you notice that\nan acquaintance you just met\nseems completely unaware\nof their surroundings\nwhile in conversation with you.\nIt's even possible that strangers\nwho walk past you are distracted\nand do a double-take as you walk by.\nSomeone's attraction to you,\nwhether platonic or romantic,\nmight be obvious\nin their subconsciously\nfocused attention on you\nwhile seeming distracted\nfrom their previous focus of attention.\nSo as long as you're not out\nthere causing traffic jams\nor having people trip from rubbernecking\nto get another look at you,\nkeep being your enticingly\nattractive self.\nHave you noticed any of these signs?\nLet us know in the comments
