    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Despite how it might sound,\nbeing unmotivated and being\nlazy aren't the same thing.\nLazy is having ability to do it,\nbut making a conscious,\npurposeful decision\nof, \"Meh, don't wanna.\"\nCauses of motivation loss can\nbe from involuntary sources,\nlike depression or other\nmental health obstacles.\nThey leave you really you\nwanting to do something,\nbut there's this invisible\nrestraint keeping you from it.\nThe feedback from others\nmay still have you fretting\nthat you're being lazy and\nletting others down, though.\nSo let's look at some signs\nto help make that difference known.\nNumber one, you feel purposeless,\nwith a bleak outlook.\nYou might notice difficulties\nbecause of a change in your outlook.\nThe comparison of,\n\"Hey, this kind of thing\nwasn't a big deal before.\nWhy am I so not into doing this now?\"\nmight make you wonder\nif you're being lazy.\nWhat it could actually be\nis that you've grown to a point\nwhere you're looking beyond\ninstant impulse gratification,\nand you're contemplating\nwhy you do what you do,\nwhere you're going,\nand what do you want down the road.\nThis is great, and it can\nalso smack you in surprise.\nIt's all too easy to get lost,\nadrift in this feeling,\nwhere you start to think,\n\"What's the point?\"\nSo instead of getting excited\nabout your life and your\nfuture, you feel lost,\nand look at all things\nas an imminent fail.\nNegative self-talk like this\ncan make everything seem pointless\nsince it's never gonna work, anyway,\nwhich leads to a self-fulfilling prophecy\nof not coming together\nbecause nothing was done.\nNumber two, you've got that bad stress.\nStress is pretty general.\nYou basically need stress to\nalert you to fulfill a need.\nThere is good stress and bad stress.\nThe bad stress is the kind\nthat doesn't move you towards a goal.\nAn example could be an assigned workload.\nGood stress.\nYou have the right amount\nto challenge yourself,\nso you feel accomplished\nby the end of the workday.\nBonus, yes!\nGive yourself a prize!\nThat is a good feeling.\nYou've taken a step towards\nthat raise, promotion,\nor retirement fund.\nBad stress.\nYou've been given so much work\nthat you're working overtime,\nstill not able to get anything done,\nand now, all the drive\nis because you're worried\nyou might be fired.\nThere is no good goal to reach.\nIt's like being beaten up\nbefore all the initial bruises healed.\nEventually, you accrue so much damage\nthat you can't even do\nwhat you did before,\nthen progress towards\nany goals gets derailed.\nNumber three, your surrounding\nenvironment is draining you.\nDon't worry, we're not\ngonna feng shui on you here.\nThat might be a future discussion.\nBut think about where\nyou try to do your thing.\nIs it a place where you can look around,\nbreathe deep, and feel inspired?\nOr, is it where you get\ndepressed, with a wave of anxiety\nwhen you observe your surroundings?\nSurroundings mean the people\nyou surround yourself with, too.\nDo they boost you,\nor are they the kind that feel this urge\nto always find something wrong with you,\nyour work, or anything else you produce?\nIf you start the day with\na tight feeling of dread\nbecause you know that drab, gray office\nconnotes a prison to you\nand caustic coworkers await like vultures\nto pick at your bones?\nWork? We mean work.\nIt's no wonder you'd be unmotivated\nto show up early and be productive.\nNumber four, you have unrealistic goals.\nWe hear way too much,\n\"Well, you gotta try\neverything,\" without context.\nThis leads to many often\nforgetting the key factor\nof being self-aware of one's limits.\nIn the movement to shout,\n\"You can do anything!\"\nthe fact that humanity\nand tedious time-consuming\nhard work form limitations.\nLet's take an example end goal\nof becoming a marathon runner.\nThis can be an unrealistic goal\nif they ignore all the work\nthat training involves,\nthey haven't thought it through,\nor researched the subject.\nSo, when a week goes by and\nthey can't run 26 miles,\nthey give up\nbecause they're overwhelmed\nand disappointed.\nSometimes, that stage of being overwhelmed\nwill stop a person before they even start\nbecause they lack any\nsort of plan or structure.\nAnd all that's in their mind now\nis big, scary mountain of things\nthat need to be done with\nshiny objectives on top.\nThey haven't given themselves small,\non-the-way goals that are reachable.\nSpeaking of planning, number five,\nyou lack structure and routine.\nStructure? Ugh.\nRoutine? Who needs it?\nWell, you do.\nWe do.\nIt's how we work at\nthings to reach a result.\nMaybe your structure is\nfull of things, like,\n\"Go skydiving once a month to feel alive,\"\ninterjected with, \"Spend one\nhour per day doing something\nthat will get you closer\nto your objective.\"\nAnd that's still structure.\nThat's still a routine.\nThink of exceptionally\nprolific and successful author,\nStephen King.\nHe has a routine which\ninvolves starting the day\nwith a small timeframe\nand giving himself a quota of words\nor pages to complete by the end of it,\nno expectations.\nSave for life or death emergencies.\nThat structure and routine\nserves as your compass.\nIt gives you something to hold onto,\nwherein you can still know,\n\"I'm still getting closer to my goal.\"\nNot having it goes together\nwith not having purpose,\nyou're adrift, and since\nthere's nothing to guide you\nnor is there an anchor point to grip,\nthere's no motivation to move ahead\nsince you don't even know where ahead is.\nWe hope that these tips have\nhelped your self-confidence,\nat least a little,\nthrough realizing you're not lazy.\nThat crushed self-confidence is a big part\nof what feeds demotivation.\nNow that you know it's not\na hopeless case of lazy,\nyou can create a strategy\nto overcome the blockades,\none step at a time.\nDon't worry.\nThe Mojo's still there,\nawaiting for you to gather it back up.\nHow do you feel about these points?\nRecognize any?\nFeel free to discuss\nand we'll see you soon.\nThanks for watching.\n(gentle music)"
