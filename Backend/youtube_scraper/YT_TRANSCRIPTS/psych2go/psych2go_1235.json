    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you\nalways considered yourself\nan introvert\nbut found that you don't really\nfit into that description.\nPerhaps you don't mind being around people\nor even enjoy mingling\nand going to events,\nbut also don't relate\nthat much to an extrovert.\nApart from being an\nintrovert and an extrovert,\nyou could be a shy extrovert.\nCurious to know what this means?\nHere are eight signs\nyou're not an introvert,\nbut a shy extrovert.\nNumber one, you have no\nproblems connecting with people.\nIs it easy for you to\nget along with others?\nSure, approaching them\ncan be quite daunting\nbut once you've engaged\nthem in a conversation,\ndo you find yourself naturally going\nwith the flow of things?\nThis is a sign that\nyou're not an introvert,\nbut rather a sensitive or shy extrovert.\nYou may not be as boisterous\nand flamboyant as others,\nbut as a shy extrovert\nyou may find yourself getting comfortable\nand into the scheme of things\nonce the initial hurdle is overcome.\nNumber two, you don't turn\ndown invitations to hang out.\nAre you always present\nin group gatherings?\nLet's say your friend calls you\nfor a spontaneous cafe hangout session.\nAre you immediately outside the door?\nIntroverts often prefer\nhaving a lot of time\non their own to recharge,\nbecause they genuinely\nenjoy their own company.\nExtroverts, by comparison,\nlike going out socializing and having fun.\nFor them, life is all\nabout being with people.\nSo if you really enjoy\ngoing to public events\nbut don't know how to go\nwithout having someone\ninvite you to it, you're\nmost likely a shy introvert.\nNumber three, you're not that bothered\nwhen the conversation gets silent.\nDo you welcome pauses in conversations?\nWith conversations,\nintroverts may often find\nthemselves running out of things\nto say and struggling to\nkeep the energy going.\nExtroverts, on the other hand,\nwill talk animatedly without stopping.\nThey tend to find stretches of\nsilence to be uncomfortable,\nas it makes them feel like\nthe vibe is dying down.\nSo in these moments,\nyou may find them switching\ntopics and talking even more\nto compensate.\nIn comparison,\nshy extroverts tend to\nappreciate conversations\nthat have pauses in between.\nThis gives them time to\nthink, sort out their ideas,\nand identify how to say them\nin the best way possible.\nNumber four, you dislike\ntalking to a large crowd.\nDo you get stagefright or jitters\nright before performances\nor speeches of any kind?\nYou may think that this is a sure sign\nthat you're not an\nextrovert, but in actuality,\neven extroverts get jittery\nduring public events.\nIt's perfectly normal.\nAnd it might just mean that\nyou care about how you appear\nto others and that you want\nthem to like what you're doing.\nWhile some extroverts\nare naturals on stage,\nshy extroverts tend to be\nmore uncomfortable with it.\nYou may prefer speaking to\npeople on a one-on-one basis\nwhere there's not as much\npressure involved instead.\nNumber five, you don't\nmind some attention.\nHow do you handle being in the spotlight?\nIntroverts often get\nuncomfortable when faced\nwith a lot of attention,\nwhile extroverts usually flourish in it.\nSo if you occasionally\nenjoy being at the center\nof attention and being\naround groups of people,\nthen you're probably a shy extrovert.\nYou won't hog to be the main attraction,\nbut it doesn't hurt and it can\nfeel nice from time to time.\nNumber six, you choose your friends.\nSince full extroverts socialize a lot,\nthey tend to make a lot of\nconnections and acquaintances,\nthough they may not be particularly\nclose with any of them.\nOn the other hand,\nintroverts will often have a\ntight-knit group of friends\nthat they hang out with exclusively.\nInnocent social interactions\ncan be exhausting for them.\nThey won't go out of their\nway to meet new people.\nSo if you find yourself in\nthe middle of these two,\nwhere you're open to meeting new people\nand forming deep connections,\nbut want to take it slow,\nthen it's likely you are a shy extrovert.\nNumber seven, you communicate\nwith others regularly.\nAre there people you chat with every day?\nPerhaps you get sad when days pass\nwithout hearing from your friends.\nIntroverts like to have\na lot of alone time.\nIt's their moment to do\ntheir own thing and relax\nwithout other people's eyes\nweighing on their back.\nFor this reason,\nthey may disappear for\ninconsistent periods of time.\nBut as a shy extrovert,\nyou may notice that although\nyou enjoy your own company,\nyou also prioritize being able to talk\nto your favorite people regularly.\nAnd number eight, you\ncrave to be liked by others\nmore than the average introvert.\nDo you care a lot about\nwhat others think of you?\nIs it important for you to\nbuild a great first impression?\nWanting to be liked by\nthe general majority,\nmay be another sign that\nyou're a shy extrovert.\nThis doesn't mean that\nintroverts don't care\nabout other people's opinions of them.\nInstead, introverts are usually content\nwith their small circle of friends\nand won't give much thought to\nthose outside of that circle.\nSo if you find that you tend to care a lot\nabout what everyone thinks\nand tend to go out of your way\nto get their approval, then\nyou may be a shy extrovert.\nDo you think you are a shy extrovert?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share
