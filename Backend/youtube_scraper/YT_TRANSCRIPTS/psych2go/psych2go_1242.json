    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you have trouble making friends?\nWould you say that\nyou're socially awkward?\nWell, you've come to the\nright place, my friend\nbecause if you're looking for\nhelp while making friends,\nPsych2Go has some tips for you.\nHere is how you can make some friends\nwhen you're socially awkward.\nNumber one.\nStart talking to strangers.\nDo strangers intimidate you?\nOr maybe you simply have no\ndesire to talk to any of them.\nYou don't know them after all,\nhow would you know if you like them?\nBut in most cases,\nfriendships are started\nby simply uttering this one word, hello.\nThe word is, hello.\nObviously, you must be thinking\nit's not as easy as that\nand it isn't always,\nbut the more you get used\nto randomly saying hello\nto those near you, or those\nwho make eye contact with you,\nthe easier you'll get used\nto social interactions\nwith strangers.\nTomorrow, it might be a simple, hello,\nthe next week you ask them how they are\nor if that book they're\nreading is any good.\nMaybe you compliment them, even better.\nThis will ease you into\nsocial interactions.\nThe simple, hello,\npleasantries, small talk,\nand then genuinely interesting\nconversations, let's hope.\nNext time you see someone beautiful\nor maybe they're wearing a\nnice outfit, compliment them\nor maybe they're great\nat a particular skill,\ncompliment them.\nMaybe they're simply\nso kind you can't help\nbut tell them that they\nput you in a better mood.\nGotta start somewhere.\nGenuine compliments are the way to go.\nNumber two.\nStart up a conversation\nwith those who intrigue you.\nOkay, so you've been\nengaging in small talk\nwith strangers a bit more,\nbut you're still friendless.\nWell, try starting a\nconversation with someone\nwho intrigues you and\ndiscuss what it is about them\nthat intrigues you, as long\nas it's not anything weird.\nThey may just wanna know more.\nThis isn't to say it should be\nthe first thing you bring up,\nbut after talking with them a bit,\nmention what it is you\nappreciate about them.\n\"Wow, I love how passionate\nyou are about painting\"\nor \"I'm so intrigued by\nyour theories on lamas,\n\"tell me more.\"\nOdds are, they won't be\ndiscussing lama theories with you,\nbut hey, you get the idea.\nIf something drew you to them,\nmaybe you have something in common.\nFind out what you do have in common\nand discuss your shared passions.\nPeople generally get excited\nto discuss things they love\nso you'll both seem more\napproachable and friendly\nwhen you discuss the things you both love.\nNumber three.\nAwkward moments are bound to happen.\nDo you dread the\ninevitable awkward silence\nthat comes along with most conversations?\nWell, it's bound to happen, people.\nInstead of panicking, embrace the silence.\n(chuckles)\nEasier said than done, right?\nYeah, but you have to push\nthrough the silence sometimes.\nAsk yourself, \"Is this\nsilence really that awkward\n\"or is it just a few\nseconds of, well, silence?\"\nGo ahead and smile at the silence\nor simply take a deep\nbreath and move on in topic.\nYou may say, \"By the way,\nthis reminds me of...\"\nOr, \"Totally random, but lately\nI've been thinking about...\"\nOr simply ask them a\nnew question, just relax\nand the change in topic or\nsilence won't be as awkward,\nand if it is, it's totally\nfine to feel a bit awkward,\nbut try to accept this.\nYou'll recover.\nYou can, I believe in you.\nNumber four.\nBe around who have the\nsame values, hobbies,\nor passions as you.\nDo you want friends?\nWell, you may need\nsomething easy to talk about\nfor starters.\nSo try engaging with others\nwho share some same hobbies\nand passions as you.\nRemember finding something in common?\nWell, how can you find these people?\nTry to join a club focused\non a passion of yours\nor attend events focused\non your favorite hobby.\nInto chess lately?\nJoin a chess club.\nLove sketching?\nTry a painting class to find\nother artists like yourself.\nNot only will you meet more artists,\nyou'll learn to paint as well.\nHaving similar hobbies\nor interests with someone\nwill make it easier to strike\nup conversation with them.\nSo it's a great start.\nNumber five.\nPretend you're a extrovert\nat first and tell yourself\nyou're just saying a few words.\nDo you really struggle\nwith approaching others\nand striking a conversation?\nWhile you should always be yourself,\nit could be a good idea to\ntry to get in the mindset\nthat you're actually\nextremely extroverted.\nSay what?\nNo, don't actually\nclaim to be an extrovert\nwhen you talk them,\nbut simply let go of the\nbelief that you struggle\ntalking to others before\nyou approach them.\nWhen you struggle socializing with others,\nit's likely all you're thinking about\nbefore you engage in\nconversation with them.\nThose silences, you're thinking about\nhow you're not the best at socializing.\nThose moments of hesitation\nbefore you approach someone,\nyou're playing out scenarios\nof what could go wrong.\nSo simply let go of that idea\nand pretend you're used\nto talking to others\nwhen you approach them.\nIn fact, you love it.\nStill talk about what\nyou like and who you are,\nand admit you are an\nintrovert if you are one\nand the time comes.\nThe important thing is\nstarting the conversation,\nand you may just need to change\nyour mindset for a moment\nto break that barrier\nof fear or awkwardness.\nAnd number six.\nIf you're invited somewhere, say yes.\nSo you happen to know a few acquaintances\nand all is going well.\nOne day someone invites\nyou to a party of theirs.\nBefore you answer, you hesitate.\n\"Wait a second\", you think.\n\"I hate parties.\"\nYou start compiling a list of excuses,\nsome real, some imaginary.\n\"I'm not feeling too well.\n\"I have homework to do.\n\"I have to walk my dog.\n\"My mom's making lasagna tonight.\n\"Uh, lasagna does sound good,\"\nbut lasagna doesn't matter anymore.\nYou may not feel like making\nfriends when they ask you,\nbut you know later you may wonder\nhow the party would've been if you went\nand you may hold onto\nsome feelings of regret.\nYes, they may pass with due time,\nbut you may still want a\nfriend or two in the future.\nSo say yes, even if it\nmeans reassuring yourself\nthat you can leave at any time.\nYou can.\nSo why not show up and see how it goes?\nStrike up a few conversations.\nLet others know you simply\ndon't know anyone here\nbesides the host.\nThey'll often be inclined\nto talk to you more,\nmake you feel comfortable,\nand get to know you.\nSay yes to any fun invitation you get\nfrom a friendly acquaintance or a friend,\nunless they're offering you\ncandy, it's not even Halloween.\nAnd remember probably the\nmost important tip of all,\nyour mom's lasagna can wait.\nIt can wait.\nSo will you use any of these tips?\nWill you embrace your social awkwardness\nand in turn, gain\nconfidence because of this,\nand in turn, possibly have an\neasier time making friends?\nWill you attempt to overcome\nthe social awkwardness?\nEmbrace the silence, my\nfriends, embrace the silence.\nSee?\nAnd we're already friends.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand
