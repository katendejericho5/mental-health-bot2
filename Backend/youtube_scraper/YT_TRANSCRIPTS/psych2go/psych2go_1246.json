    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Depression is\nknown as a silent killer\nbecause it causes so much\npain to the individual,\nbut it's invisible for\npeople to see on the outside,\nespecially if the\nindividual hides it well.\nWe'd like to help get\nrid of some of the stigma\nand educate others about ways\npeople hide their depression.\nSo let's begin.\nNumber one, using laughter and humor.\nRemember the time you made\na joke about your pain\nand laughed about it with your friends\nand it made you temporarily feel better.\nSometimes depressed people use humor\nas a defense mechanism and fake\nbeing happy on the outside.\nMaking jokes and making people laugh\ndistracts the people around them\nfrom seeing that they're falling apart.\nNumber two, isolation and excuses.\nIf you find your friend\nconsistently giving weak excuses\nto not come over, they may\nbe hiding their depression,\nbut don't take it personally.\nDepression takes away your\ndesire to do the things you love\nand to be around people.\nSo they hide away.\nDepressed people are hard on themselves\nand sometimes getting\nout of bed is impossible,\nand basic hygiene practices are neglected.\nWe judge and compare\nourselves to others harshly.\nAnd we come up with\nelaborate excuses sometimes\nso we don't have to socialize,\nbecause then we would\nhave no place to hide\nour difficult and taxing emotions\nif we were around other people.\nThree, alcohol and substance abuse.\nPeople suffering from depression\nmight be turning to alcohol\nand other mood-altering\nsubstances on a daily basis.\nIt definitely has the\npotential to escalate\ninto addiction and ruin their lives\nand those around them,\nas these patterns become more frequent.\nA Journal Article by\nWilsnack, (indistinct)\nstated that alcohol use disorder\ncan occur alongside depression,\nespecially in women.\nThey partake in alcohol\nand substance abuse\nto numb their pain\nand the reality of what\ngoes on in their minds.\nBeing in their own head can\nfeel like being in a prison.\nAnd these coping\nmechanisms ease their pain,\nraise their mood, and\nremove them temporarily\nfrom their anguish.\nAccording to statistics, only\na small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nIf you're not subscribed yet,\nand you enjoy what you see,\ndo you consider hitting\nthe Subscribe button.\nThis encourages the YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content\nIn contrast to the point about isolation,\nsome depressed people are\nactually socially active,\nwhether it's online with\ntheir social media presence,\nor in real life with their\nstrangers, families and friends.\nThey are a ray of sunshine\nand seem quite bubbly\nand outgoing.\nThey compliment people\nand are fun to be around.\nOf course, some people\nare genuinely this way,\nbut others are forcing\nthemselves to be more cheery\nand bright to offset and hide\nany darkness and hopelessness.\nThey get to momentarily\nhide from it themselves.\nNumber five, anger.\nAn interesting fact in how\ndepression manifests in people,\naccording to the National\nInstitute of Mental Health,\nis the \"men are usually more aggressive\nand have misplaced anger\nwhile women are more\nprone to display sadness\nand be more withdrawn.\"\nThis however is not set in stone\nas people are more complex than that,\nand can obviously hide many things,\nincluding mental illness.\nAnger is another defense mechanism\nthat depressed people use\nto close themselves off\nfrom other people.\nIt creates a distance\nbetween them and others\nso that they don't see that\nunderneath the anger is sadness.\nNumber six, hiding distress\nby focusing on other people\nand other things.\nA depressed person in our world sucks.\nThere's a lot of misery\nand they feel trapped.\nSo they might hide by turning\nall of their attention away\nfrom the pain by distracting themselves\nwith the outside world\nand focusing outwards.\nThey will be readily available\nto help those around them,\nor even complete strangers\nthat focus on anything\nbut themselves because\nthe pain and turmoil\nare too much to bear.\nThey'll create never-ending to-do lists\nand immerse themselves in others' lives\nto not have to face their\nown negative thoughts\nand feelings.\nThis is another way to detach themselves\nfrom their depression because in a way,\nby being so generous with their time,\nenergy and even finances,\nthey get to be someone and somewhere else.\nAnd number seven, minimizing\npain and deflecting from it.\nWe often say, I'm okay, or I'm fine\nas social pleasantries during small talk.\nIt's not always true,\nbut we don't really have\nthe time to know more,\nespecially with how busy we are\nand how we feel the\ncompulsion to be somewhere\nand doing something.\nPeople who hide their\ndepression keep a lot of things\nto themselves.\nSo saying, \"I'm okay\" when they aren't\nis a usual practice to\ndeflect from their pain\nand to stop people from\nasking any more questions.\nDid you see any of these\nsigns in anyone else,\nor maybe do you see some\nof them in yourself?\nStruggling with depression is exhausting\nand emotionally draining.\nAnd because of the current\nstigma that comes with it,\npeople will hide it to protect themselves.\nIf you notice any changes\nsimilar to these and loved ones,\nlet them know that you're there for them.\nIf you are struggling,\nplease reach out to a\nqualified healthcare provider\nor mental health professional.\nGetting in touch with the right person\ncan be a great first step\nto getting back on track.\nWhat are some things you've learned?\nWhat's something you\nwish to learn more about?\nWhat has been your experience?\nWrite them down in the comments,\nand as always, thanks\nso much for watching."
