    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nHave you ever wondered\nif you are surrounded by the right people?\nPerhaps there are people in\nyour inner circle of friends\nwho are only around when\nthey need something.\nMaybe you find that they\nalways seem to agree\nwith everything you say and do,\nor maybe they always like\nthe same thing as you.\nIt's difficult to know whether someone\nis a truly nice person or not,\nespecially if they always\ndisguise themselves\nas such around you.\nBecause of their seemingly nice behavior,\na lot of fake people get away\nwith being labeled as good,\ndespite their toxic habits.\nSo to help you figure\nout whether the people\nin your life are really good for you,\nhere are six common traits\nof fake, nice people.\nNumber one, the only\nrespect people with power.\nHave you ever noticed\nsomeone acting extra nice\nwhen meeting people with a\nrelatively high social status?\nIt's normal to behave differently\nwhen interacting with\npeople of a higher status,\nfor example, you wouldn't\ntreat the Queen of England\nthe same way as you treat your friends.\nHowever, if you notice that change\nin behavior is too drastic,\nchances are that person\nis a fake nice person.\nAs a general rule, you\nshould always judge a person\nby how they treat their\nsubordinates, not their seniors.\nBy applying this general rule\nyou may just be able to determine\nwhether someone is a truly nice person\nor just someone who is interested\nin other people's power and status.\nNumber two, they pretend\nto try to please everyone.\nDo you know someone who\nputs an incredible amount\nof effort into pleasing everyone?\nBecause they want everyone to like them.\nThey can't stand the\nidea of being rejected.\nThis need to please everyone\nwill make them say yes\nto anything and everything\nthat is asked of them\nwhich often leads to them being\nlabel as nice and friendly.\nBut oftentimes you'll find\nthat they can't actually come\nthrough with their promises\nwhether it's because they've\nmade too many promises\nto too many people, or because\nthey don't feel motivated\nto fulfill what they had said.\nPeople like this tend to\ndisappoint in the end.\nNumber three, they\ndesperately seek attention.\nAre you friends with someone\nwho always needs attention\nbefore doing something nice?\nFake nice people are always\ndesperate for attention.\nSo, they'll tend to do\nthings to receive praise.\nIn contrast, genuinely nice people\naren't motivated by external factors\nsuch as other people's\napproval or attention.\nInstead, they're motivated\nby internal values.\nSo they'll do good things and help others\nbecause they want to.\nIf you notice that your\nfriends stop doing nice things\nwhen you don't praise them for it\nthen it might be a sign that\ntheir behavior is not genuine.\nNumber four, they gossip\nand talk behind your back.\nDo you have a friend\nwho's always gossiping\nand talking behind people's backs?\nWhile everyone has the right\nto express their opinions\nand say what they think,\ngossiping and talking about\nsomeone behind their back\nis a harmful way of attacking and damaging\nsomeone's reputation and character.\nInstead, people who are genuine\ntend to express their emotions openly\nand are willing to talk\nthrough their disagreement\nwith the person they're opposed to.\nNumber five, they disappear\nwhen you need them the most.\nCan you think of a friend\nwho is never around\nwhen you need them the most?\nThis is a very common trait\namong people who are fake.\nThey tend to be there for you\nonly when they need something from you,\nbut never the other way around.\nWhether it's asking you for a favor\nor wanting to take part in your success,\nfake nice people will only treat you well\nwhen it's convenient\nand beneficial for them.\nSo you might want to\navoid people like this\nif you don't wanna end up\nin a one-sided relationship\nwhere you are constantly\ntaken for granted.\nAnd number six, they avoid\nquestions about themselves.\nHave you ever talked to\nsomeone who constantly\navoided answering\nquestions about themselves?\nFake people tend to put\nan extraordinary amount\nof effort into avoiding any\ntype of personal questions.\nThe reason for this has to\ndo with their general goal\nof wanting to be liked\nby everyone around them.\nBy not answering any personal questions\nthey effectively avoid the risk\nof giving you the wrong\nimpression or opinion of them.\nSo instead, they may try\nto redirect the question\ntowards you and then agree\nwith whatever you say.\nDo any of these traits\ndescribe someone you know?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nUltimately it's always\nimportant to go with your gut.\nAll the points we've mentioned\ngives you a general idea\nof what fake nice people might\ndo in different situations,\nbut in the end, it all depends\non how you feel about them.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified
