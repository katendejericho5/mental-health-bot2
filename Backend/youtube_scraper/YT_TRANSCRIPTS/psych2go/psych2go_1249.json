    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nhow's your energy level?\nDo you feel worn out way more\nthan you think you should?\nYou can think of your energy like water,\nwith your body and mind being the bucket\nand the bucket has a hole.\nBut how do we fix that\nhole and get more water?\nLet's fix the leak with knowledge.\nHere are some habits we can mix\nto help with that energy flow.\nNumber one, watching lots of tear jerkers.\nHow ironic is this?\nWe like a show because it makes us feel,\nbut then we overload with binge watching\nand it makes us feel too much.\nEmpathy is great, don't get us wrong,\nbut letting it run amok by feeding it\nemotion wrenching shows\nmakes it a monster.\nWith all that high intensity emotion\ncontinually ramping up,\nour mental efforts to dampen\nand control the emotions\nkick in.\nThat extra effort means mental fatigue,\nand you got it,\nlow energy levels.\nSo keep up the good empathy work\nbut give yourself a break\nwith something fluffy\nonce in a while.\nNumber two, taking shallow breaths.\nAlthough breathing is automatic,\nwe have the power to affect the quality.\nImagine being parched\nso you fill a cup with two drops,\ndrink that have to refill\nit with another two drops\nand repeat.\nThe result is you're still thirsty\nand now you're also tired\nfrom the effort of\nexcessive multiple refills.\nDon't be stingy with oxygen.\nLimited O2 means less fuel\nfor our cells and organs\nand your brain starts to panic\nbecause it's feeling a little suffocated.\nThat anxiety just makes\nbreathing even shallower,\nand we're already feeling\ntired just talking about it.\nIt feels really good\nto unshallow yourself.\nJust takes several deep breaths,\nall the way down to your belly\nbutton and slowly exhale.\nYou good, we're good?\nNumber three, planning\ntoo far in the future.\nNow planning isn't bad, it's great.\nIt's how you minimize things\nlike not being able to pay rent\nor being able to get work done in time\nso you can go out.\nBut like most things, don't go overboard.\nSay it with us,\nbalance.\nIf your calendar is virtually made of ink\nand you have every moment\nof your life mapped out\nfor the next year, it\ncan get overwhelming.\nYou start to find that your\nmind keeps worrying about\nwhat's going to happen in the future\ninstead of focusing on\nwhat's happening now.\nThis anticipatory anxiety is still anxiety\nand can mess up your\nability to stay mindful\nand finish what's on hand.\nYou end up accomplishing less overall\nand feeling less than stellar.\nHaving you time and\ndoing nothing at all time\nis a necessary breather to stop yourself\nfrom screaming into burnout mode.\nIt's healthy, so go ahead and tell someone\nyou can reschedule.\nGrab a drink of your choice and chill.\nNumber four, letting little tasks pile up.\nThis is the procrastination\ngoblin calling in.\nThe little creature is whispering,\n\"You don't need to call the dentist yet.\n\"That light still has two\noutta three bulbs lit.\"\nKnow what they don't tell you?\nLots of little ignored things\nwill pile together like Voltron\nand become a huge thing\nthat keeps knocking at\nthe back of your mind.\nBefore you know it,\nyour brain only sees this\nmassive endless list of tasks\nthat's overwhelming so\nit stresses and worries\nand gets nothing done.\nYou can defeat it though,\nand you still get to procrastinate a bit.\nShh, it'll be our secret.\nYou can write the task down\non a readily available\nand visible to-do list.\nThis lets you parcel\nthem out into little bits\nin a reasonable amount of time\nsince they're not out of sight outta mind.\nNumber five, having to stay indoors\nfor a prolonged period of time.\nThis one's a toughie.\nWe know, I mean global pandemic, anyone?\nYeah, by law, we had to stay\nindoors for like two years.\nSo if you're feeling\ndrained, it's not abnormal.\nThe Journal Of Environmental Psychology\nfound that humans require\nnature to flourish.\nWhy?\nThey didn't say.\nBut the studies showed a\nsignificant increase in energy\nwhen your time was spent in nature,\neven if it was virtual or imagined.\nThey weren't even hiking\nor mountain climbing,\nso go ahead and lay on the lawn\nor daydream about it to\nget a bit of a boost.\nNumber six, slouching.\nAre you slouching right now?\nWe know gravity does it's thing\nand it just feels so much easier\nto slide down in your comfy chair.\nBut over time you're draining your energy.\nPoor posture puts additional\nstrain on our joints,\nligaments and muscles.\nAdditional strain means fatigue.\nIt's even been found that standing tall\nand sitting up straight can\nhelp with depressive symptoms\nin addition to reducing fatigue.\nHey, think of it as a good\nexcuse, we mean reason,\nto go shopping for a nice ergonomic chair.\nWe hear gaming chairs have\nbecome rather ergonomic.\nAnd number seven, not\ndrinking enough water.\nAll right, harsh truth time.\nHumans are bags of water, seriously.\nWe're something like 70% water.\nIn short, we need the stuff,\nit's actually required for life.\nWater is in everything,\nand if you ever wanted\nto be a water bender\nyou'll definitely know a good\nportion of blood is water.\nSo when you're dehydrated\nyour blood gets thicker, sludgier,\nmeaning it doesn't move\nso well through your body.\nYou know what blood does?\nEverything.\nIt's the ultimate courier for\nall things life necessary.\nSo if it gets all slow, everyone suffers.\nAnd when I say everyone,\nI mean your organs and muscles.\nYou cannot have a supply\nchain issue with your blood\nand still be energized.\nSo remember to have your personal\nanti sludge secret weapon on hand,\na water bottle.\nStay hydrated and feel the recharge.\nOur modern lives have these\nsneaky seemingly normal habits\nthat just sap away our energy,\nbut knowledge is power and now you know.\nDid any of these click with you?\nHave you tried any of the solutions\nand how did they work out?\nPlease feel free to\ncomment, share and discuss.\nHopefully these tips\nhave given you the energy\nto watch another video"
