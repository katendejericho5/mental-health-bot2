    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have big goals and dreams?\nDespite how challenging and lofty\nsome of them may sound,\nonce you have an ambition set in place\nand a vision of where\nthe finish line will be,\nyou're dead set on making it.\nIf this is you, then you're\nlikely to be a high achiever.\nWhile it may sound like\na grand title to have,\nbeing someone so dedicated\nto reaching success\ncan also cause you to pick up\na couple of not so healthy habits\nand practices along the way.\nBut by acknowledging them\nand understanding their consequences,\nyou can use what you know\nto help change any harmful\nbehaviors you have.\nSo here are five toxic\nhabits of high achievers.\nNumber one, you find it hard to say no.\nIs it difficult for you to\ndecline someone's requests?\nIf you are a high achiever,\nthen it's likely that people know you\nto be hard working and reliable,\nmaking you everyone's go-to\nwhen there's a favor to be asked or done.\nWhether it's your boss handing you\nan almost toppling\npaperwork stack to complete\nor a friend asking for homework answers,\nyou might find yourself saying yes.\nThis difficulty to decline and say no\nmight be due to a need\nto please other people,\nwhich may stem from a\nfear of disappointment\nor wanting to avoid conflict,\nespecially with superiors,\nlike teachers or bosses.\nBut being unable to voice a genuine answer\nprevents you from defending your needs,\nlike your time and energy\nand doubles any stress you already have,\nmaking you prone to burnout.\nNumber two, your too\nindependent for your own good.\nDo you see yourself as your best teammate?\nWhile being an independent\nworker is great,\neveryone has times where\nthey aren't able to shoulder\neverything they wanna take on.\nIf you struggle to seek help\nwhen things get overwhelming,\nit's unhealthy to force yourself to try\nand get the tasks done anyway.\nWhether you do so because of pride\nor because you think you'll\nbe a burden to others,\nit's important to know\nthat asking for help is more than okay,\nand doing so doesn't mean\nyou're any less capable as a person.\nAt the end of the day,\nyou have a limited amount\nof energy and can only take on so much.\nThis is why sometimes two\nheads can be better than one\nwhen you're in need of a helping hand.\nNumber three, you are a perfectionist.\nAre you someone who never settles\nfor anything less than an A+?\nWhen you set high standards\nlike this for yourself\nyou may also set yourself\nup for disappointment\nsince even the slightest\nfall from your standards\ncan result in a big blow\nto your self-esteem.\nIf you are a perfectionist,\nyour self worth may be\nreliant on your performance\nor you may only feel validation\nfrom your achievements.\nIf so, high achievers like you\nmight often find yourself dealing\nwith self-doubt, feelings of inadequacy,\nand difficulty coping with failures.\nBy striving for perfection,\nyou disregard the fact that you are human\nand you're bound to make mistakes.\nThis needless to say is\nnot a healthy approach\nto doing your best.\nNumber four, you are highly self critical.\nAre you your own worst enemy?\nEven when you do a job well done\nyou might still find\nsomething to criticize.\nBecause of this tendency to\nfixate over your weaknesses\ninstead of your strengths,\nyou might be always selling\nyourself short to others.\nBeing so self critical may be a result\nof low self-esteem and possibly\nbecause of growing up around parents\nor guardians who placed\nunrealistic standards on you.\nBeing hyper critical can cause you\nto blame yourself for every mistake\nand failure that happens.\nAnd also make you someone unable to accept\ncompliments from others as is\nby always responding with a flaw\nof yours to bring yourself down.\nWe all have our moments of\nself pity and self blame.\nwhen things don't go our way,\nbut it's important to remember\neven the most well accomplished people\nhave had their fair share of failures too.\nAnd number five, you neglect self care.\nDo you believe that you always\nhave to be working hard\nto achieve your goals?\nIf so, you might also\nbelieve that the fastest way\nto success is to work constant,\nlong, hard hours each day.\nBecause of this, you might\nskip well needed breaks,\nhave a poor sleep schedule,\nand not make time for\nactivities you like to do\nfor the sake of entertainment.\nBeing fixated on making\nthe most of your time\nby only doing work can also\nlead to feelings of guilt\nwhen you do spend time with your family\nor friends or doing activities to relax.\nBy neglecting self-care,\nhigh achievers like you\nare likely to work yourself\nto the point of burnout,\nwhich you might only\nrealize once it's too late.\nSo are you a high achiever?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from
