    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever felt that\nif you were smarter,\nyou would have fewer\nproblems in your life?\nWe've all wished for\nsome more intelligence\nwhen we got a bad grade\nor made a dumb mistake.\nOf course, we'd like to emphasize\nthat there are multiple\ndifferent types of intelligence.\nBut did you know\nthat high intelligence can\ncause its own problems?\nHere are five struggles only\nsmart people will understand.\nNumber one: you're prone\nto imposter syndrome.\nMathematician Bertrand Russell once said,\n\"The fundamental cause of the trouble\nis that in the modern world,\nthe stupid are cocksure\nwhile the intelligent are full of doubt.\"\nDoes this doubt sound familiar to you?\nSmart people are extremely aware\nof how much they don't know yet,\nwhich can lead to imposter syndrome.\nThose experiencing imposter syndrome feel\nlike they don't deserve\nthe success they've gotten\nand that they're a fraud\nwho's just been lucky so far.\nThey're constantly fearful\nthat they're not as talented\nas others think and their\nincompetence will be exposed.\nIf this sounds like you, don't despair.\nFind reasons to enjoy your\ntasks for their own sake\ninstead of anxiously wondering\nwhether you're good at them.\nNumber two: you're often alone.\nHow many things are on\nyour to-do list right now?\nIf you're a highly intelligent individual,\nthis list is probably overflowing.\nResearch shows that smart\npeople have a greater ability\nto solve problems and\nadapt to new challenges.\nAs a result, their time is\nmore focused on big goals\nthat make the most of their capacities.\nUnfortunately, this also\nmeans they have much less time\nto socialize, so they're often alone.\nIf this sounds like you, don't despair.\nThe research also finds\nthat smart people are\nimpacted by loneliness less\nbecause pursuing their\ngoals can be satisfying\nin their own way.\nNumber three: you're stuck\nin analysis paralysis.\nDid you take a long time\nto make your last big life decision?\nSmart people know the value\nof thinking things through,\ncollecting information,\nand considering multiple perspectives.\nThis is a key part of\nwhat makes them smart.\nBut do you also agonize\nover small decisions,\nalways unsure about the right choice?\nThen you might be experiencing\nanalysis paralysis,\nwhere you overthink a situation\nand don't take action.\nSmart people often find that\ntheir intelligence works\nagainst them when they face this problem.\nIf this sounds like you, don't despair.\nSet a time limit to make\ndecisions and then commit\nto whatever you've thought\nof when it expires,\neven if it doesn't feel\nlike the perfect choice.\nNumber four: you're burdened\nby high expectations.\nHave you ever been\nlabeled gifted as a child\nor told that you had a lot of potential?\nSmart people know this is not\nas encouraging as it sounds.\nThey're often burdened\nby the high expectations\nplaced on them throughout their lives.\nThey face constant pressure\nto excel at everything they do\nwith no room for failure or mediocrity.\nA study by the University\nof Texas at Austin\nasked elderly individuals\nwith high intelligence\nto look back on their lives.\nThe ones who had been\nlabeled gifted as children\nhad lower psychological\nwell-being and felt\nlike their lives had disappointed\neveryone's expectations.\nIf this sounds like you, don't despair.\nCelebrate achievements you're proud of,\nrather than thinking about the\ntimes you've let others down.\nAnd number five: you can't\nexplain yourself to others.\nDo you ever feel like\nothers just don't get you\nwhen you try to explain yourself?\nResearch shows that smart people suffer\nfrom the curse of knowledge.\nThis means they know so\nmuch that they can't think\nthrough the perspective of\nsomeone who lacks that knowledge.\nPassion, knowledge, and\nexpertise on a subject\ncan actually make someone worse\nat explaining it to others.\nAs a result, communication\nbetween a smart person\nand a novice can break down very quickly\nwhen the novice can't properly interpret\nwhat the other is saying\nand the other can't understand\nwhy the novice is confused.\nIf this sounds like you, don't despair.\nGetting regular feedback\nabout the other person's perspective\ncan help to bridge this gap\nand explain complicated topics.\nSo did you relate to any of these points?\nDid we miss anything?\nIf so, let us know in\nthe comments down below.\nRemember that intelligence\ncomes in many forms.\nIt's also not the end-all, be-all.\nIntelligence comes with its own problems,\nand it doesn't take you far\nwithout hard work and commitment.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find some\ninsight in the video, too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below, as always,\nand thank you for watching.\nI'll see you next time."
