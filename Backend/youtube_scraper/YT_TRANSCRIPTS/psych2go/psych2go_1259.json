    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nDo you have a crush?\nHaving trouble determining\nif they feel the same way about you\nthat you feel about them?\nWell, there are a few body language signs\nthat, together, could reveal\nif someone has a crush on you.\nHere are six body language\nsigns someone is into you.\nNumber one, their torso is\nturned towards you in a group.\nNext time you are in a\nconversation with your group,\nnotice what direction\ntheir torso is facing.\nIf their torso is turned towards you,\nthis could show they're interested in you.\nAlso, pay close attention\nto if their chest\nis more expanded and open,\nor closed off and inward.\nOpen body language often shows confidence.\nAnd if they continue displaying\nthis openness as you approach,\nthis could mean they are welcoming you\ninto this conversation.\nIf their body language is closed off,\nit may mean they're disinterested,\nor they might be shy.\nIf their face is flushed and\nthey appear shy, nervous,\nand smile at you subtly,\nthey could like you but they're just shy.\nLook out for other signs, as well.\nIt's important to understand\nthat some people can be simply shy.\nBut if someone appears completely\nuncomfortable with you,\nthen it's best to respect their space.\nNumber two, they mirror\nyour body language.\nHave you heard of the chameleon effect?\nThis is when we unconsciously\nmimic another's mannerisms,\nposture and facial expressions.\nWe mirror their body language,\noften because we like them\nor want them to like us.\nIf you notice your\ncrush starting to mirror\nyour gestures and body language,\nthis could mean they find you attractive\nand wanna get to know you better.\nCourtney Geter, a sex and\nrelationship therapist,\nstated that, \"People\nbegin to mirror each other\n\"when they're comfortable.\"\nSo you may be able to tell when someone\nis warmed up to you and likes you\nwhen they slowly start\nmimicking your behaviors.\nNumber three, they lean towards you.\nSo, what about when you two\nare sitting fairly close together?\nIs your crush unafraid\nto sit close to you,\nlean towards you?\nDo they lean towards you\nat any chance they get in conversation?\nWhen someone leans towards\nyou, they're on your side.\nNotice who's leaning into each\nother during conversations.\nAnd it's probably the\nclosest friends or lovers.\nSo if you spot your crush\nusing any chance they can get\nto get closer to you,\nit looks like they're\ncomfortable with you,\nand they may just like you, too.\nNumber four, they often subtly\ntouch your arm or shoulder.\nAnother easy sign to look out for\nis subtly touching your arm or shoulder.\nThey could gently nudge your arm,\nor maybe their hand brushes against yours.\nThey may excuse it as accidental,\nbut they likely wanna be that close to you\nin the first place.\nIf they don't claim it's an accident,\nthey could just be trying\nto break the barrier of awkwardness\nand be comfortable with you.\nAs long as both of you are comfortable,\nit's a good sign the two of\nyou could be more than friends.\nNumber five, their face is flushed\nand their temperature is hot.\nWhile you may think they look hot,\nare they physically hot?\nI mean, are they warm?\nIs their body temperature hot?\nWhen someone is attracted\nto another person,\ntheir body temperature may\nrise when they're with them.\nSo if you start a\nconversation with your crush\nand notice their face\nsuddenly gets flushed,\nit's a good sign they could like you.\nThey may turn their face\ndownwards out of nervousness,\nor maybe they smile wide\nwith instant happiness at seeing you.\nEither way, a flushed face could mean\nthey're actually crushing for you, too.\nAnd number six,\nthey look at you and smile\nor laugh in your direction.\nSo we have a flushed\nface, leaning towards you,\nmirroring your body language.\nWhat else?\nOf course, a classic\nsmile at the sight of you\nis always a good sign.\nBut it's even better if they're in a group\nand they look at you when they smile.\nIf someone says a funny joke,\nwho does your crush turn\nto you while laughing?\nIs it you?\nHmm, they may like you as a friend.\nOr if their face is flushed, too,\nit looks like they may like you.\nSo, does anyone show any\nof these body language signs around you?\nWho?\nIs it your crush, your friend?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the Like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching,\nand see you next time."
