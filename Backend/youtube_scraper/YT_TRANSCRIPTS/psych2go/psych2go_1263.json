    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nAnxiety is the result of the fight\nor flight response to danger.\nDo you feel anxious a lot?\nWhile it's normal to feel\nanxious from time to time,\nit can become a problem if it's overactive\nand kicks in despite you being\nin no real physical danger,\nas it can disrupt the function\nand the quality of your life.\nSome of the more general\nand common symptoms are:\ninsomnia, overthinking,\nand hyperventilation.\nBut did you know that there\nare also some symptoms\nthat often get overlooked?\nHere are seven anxiety symptoms\nthat often go unnoticed.\nBefore we begin, we would like to mention\nthat this video is created\nfor educational purposes only\nand is not intended to substitute\na professional diagnosis.\nIf you suspect you may\nhave anxiety disorder\nor any mental health condition,\nwe highly advise you to seek help\nfrom a qualified mental\nhealth professional.\nNumber one, stomach problems.\nDo you often get a stomachache\nwhen you're nervous?\nAnxiety has a strong link\nwith certain stomach problems,\nso it's common to experience\nan excess amount of gas,\nbloating, and indigestion when\nyou're nervous or stressed.\nMoreover, people with specific\ngastrointestinal conditions,\nlike irritable bowel\nsyndrome, among others,\nmay find that their symptoms\nflare up with anxiety.\nEating healthy and avoiding caffeine\nmay help reduce these problems.\nNumber two, forgetfulness.\nHave you ever found yourself forgetting\nwhere certain things are\nor losing track of what\nyou're supposed to be doing?\nWhen in a state of constant\noverthinking and worry,\nyou may find it hard to focus\nand to keep your thoughts organized.\nPart of this can be\nattributed to anxiety itself\nbut can also be attributed\nto sleep deprivation\nas a result of anxious symptoms.\nNumber three, unusual aches and pain.\nDid you know that your anxiety\ncan affect your physical\nas well as your mental wellbeing?\nWhen you're feeling especially anxious,\nyou may notice that you experience strange\nand painful sensations\nthat cannot be attributed\nto any illness or accident.\nThis is usually due to muscle tension,\nas a result of the\nfight or flight response\nof your body when you're anxious.\nNumber four, rash and\nother skin conditions.\nDo you get itchy when you're stressed?\nWeird itching, hives, and other types\nof rashes may be attributed to anxiety.\nAccording to a 2019\nEnlightened Solution's article,\nthis is due to an increase in cortisol\nand adrenaline that makes\nyour body more prone\nto developing these conditions.\nIt is important, however, to\nseek help if a rash gets worse\nor persists for an\nextended period of time,\nas it may be a sign of something else.\nNumber five, excessive sleepiness.\nHow much sleep do you get every night?\nHaving anxiety, where\nyou're in a constant state\nof alertness and worry, can\nbe draining and exhausting.\nCoupled with the fact\nthat anxiety can make\nsleeping more difficult,\nyou may find yourself feeling\ntired and sleepy all the time.\nWith less energy to do things you enjoy\nand difficulty getting\nyour much needed rest,\nthis exhaustion may end\nup affecting other areas of your life.\nNumber six, impulsive behaviors.\nHave you ever found yourself doing\nthings you wouldn't normally do?\nBecause anxiety can put your\nemotions into overdrive,\nit can cause you to act\nout in impulsive ways.\nYou might lash out at others\nand say things without thinking\nor find yourself taking\npart in harmful activities\nthat you'd normally stay away from.\nUltimately, anxiety can make it difficult\nfor you to think clearly\nand puts you more on the edge than normal.\nAnd number seven, feeling cold.\nDo you tend to wear a\njacket wherever you go\neven if you weather is quite warm?\nWhen you feel particularly anxious,\nyou may notice that you\nfeel colder than normal.\nThis is because the fight\nor flight response can\nmake circulation difficult,\npushing the temperature\nto the chilly side.\nThis is especially true\nwith your fingers and toes\nsince those are general areas\nwhere circulation is harder to reach.\nDo you know of other signs\nthat often get overlooked?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share it\nwith those who might benefit from it\nand don't forget to subscribe\nand hit the notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies used\nin this video are added\nin the description below.\nThanks for watching and\nsee you in our next one."
