    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever\nasked yourself, am I toxic?\nIf so, then you are taking a\nstep in the right direction.\nBeing self-aware is the\nfirst stage of acceptance\nthat you and everyone\naround you are imperfect.\nSometimes you don't\nnotice that your habits\nare harmful to you and your loved ones.\nAnd that's why it's good\nto learn more about them\nand how to reduce that behavior.\nSo here are six signs\nthat you are unintentionally\ntoxic, but not malicious.\nNumber one, you make a lot more\npromises than you can keep.\nDo you have a habit of\npromising a lot of things?\nThings like, \"I promise I\nwon't tell anyone your secret.\"\nBut then you end up\nspilling it out later on.\nIf you tend to over\npromise and under deliver,\nyou might not notice\nthat you're being unintentionally toxic.\nGenerally, over promising stands\nfrom our desire to be liked or accepted.\nBut this can damage your relationships\nand even your reputation.\nIn order to break away from this habit,\nit helps to take your time\nbefore promising something.\nTry considering, will you\nbe able to stand by it?\nWhat are its consequences\nif you do break them?\nBy identifying these things,\nyou will know the weight of\nwhat you're about to promise.\nBe straightforward and\ncommunicative about your limits.\nThey'll understand your side\nas long as you're clear about it.\nNumber two, you use pity to\nget the things that you want.\nYou find yourself using\nother people's pity or guilt.\nThings like, \"I feel so tired\nof doing everything in this house.\"\n\"If only someone could\nhelp me with the dishes\nthat would be great.\"\nOr maybe \"It's been so long\nsince I had time for myself\nand I still have to be on duty tonight.\"\nJust debate someone else in\ntaking your shift out of pity.\nThese actions are a form of manipulation\nand it also stems from you not knowing\nhow to ask for help directly.\nYou probably aren't used to opening up.\nThis can lead others to see you\nas selfish or outright manipulative.\nIt's helpful to know when\nto ask for help directly.\nOther people will understand.\nAnd when you reach out for help,\nit shows that you trust them.\nBe respectful, considerate,\nyet straightforward enough\nto get your point across.\nDon't be afraid to take help\nand be generous in giving it.\nNumber three, you're defensive.\nDo you notice that you're\nconstantly blaming people\nor outside factors?\nBlaming is an easy way out.\nWe make someone or\nsomething else responsible\nrather than owning up to our past.\nYou may feel inclined to do so\nbecause you wanna prove that you're right,\nto the point where you\nvictimize as yourself.\nBut sometimes being right\ndoesn't solve the situation.\nWhat was the problem in the first place?\nWhat can you do to fix it?\nTry to think as a team\nrather than calling out individual faults.\nThere are always multiple\nsides to a situation.\nSo the next time you find\nyourself in this situation,\ntry asking yourself,\nhow can you be better?\nBy do so, you're taking part of the blame\nand working to find a better solution.\nNumber four, you're overly sensitive.\nDo you feel like you need to\nhave a response to everything?\nWhen you're too sensitive\nyou may feel like everyone is against you\nor that what they say is a confrontation\nto your existence or belief.\nBeing too sensitive may be\ncaused by low self-esteem.\nYou may feel like you have\nto be constantly on the defensive.\nThis usually stems from a\nrough childhood upbringing.\nIf you were constantly\nridiculed about things\nyou didn't have control of, chances are\nyou grew up with insecurities over them.\nIn trying to heal from\nbecoming too sensitive,\nit's good to be self-aware.\nAcknowledge your tendencies and attempt\nto not defend yourself against them.\nIndulge in what self-care means to you.\nIdentify which parts of yourself\nyou like and focus on them.\nOnce you have a healthy view\nof yourself and identity,\nyou'll be more than capable\nof shrugging other people's opinions off.\nNumber five, you are\nexceedingly pessimistic.\nAre you the type of person\nwho always expects the worst outcome?\nLet's say someone compliments you,\ndo you simply appreciate the gesture\nor think that there's\nsomething more behind it?\nBeing pessimistic means that\nyou always see the negative side things.\nWhen other people are constantly subjected\nto this cynical energy,\nthey might feel that\nyou are a kill joy who wants nothing but\nto dampen the mood for them.\nIt may be that you're pessimistic\nfor the sake of being\npractical and realistic,\nbut sometimes it's good\nto let loose and have fun.\nPlus being too negative\ncan cause stress, anxiety, and depression.\nThere are always better ways\nto approach situations rather\nthan being pessimistic.\nTry to run words in your head first\nbefore saying them out loud.\nDo you think it would ruin the mood?\nIf so, then there's probably a better way\nand time to say it.\nDeveloping a positive mindset\nis a conscious effort.\nLook at solutions instead\nof potential problems.\nThat way, you're not\nwallowing in the bad stuff.\nLastly, it's best to surround yourself\nwith supportive, understanding\nand optimistic people.\nAnd number six, you rely\non others for validation.\nWhen you're too caught up\nin other people's opinions\nto the point where you plan your life\nor you're complimented, you may not notice\nthat you're being toxic.\nNot to them, but to yourself.\nYour body, your personality, your skills,\nevery part of you is beautiful.\nEvery part of you is important.\nBut if you need other people to say it\nbefore you can feel validated,\nyou may be facing insecurities\ndue to low self-esteem.\nIf you notice yourself relying\non other people's views\nmore than your own,\ntry to take a step back\nand examine why you feel that way.\nDo you want to feel accepted?\nIs your own opinion not\nenough on this matter?\nWhy do you think so?\nTake small conscious\nsteps to a happier self\nto rely less on outside validation.\nIt can work wonders.\nDid you relate to this video?\nRemember that you're not a bad person\nif you can relate to these signs.\nYou're already better by\neducating yourself about it.\nDo you have experiences with friends\nwho are being unintentionally toxic?\nHow do you handle them?\nShare your experiences in\nthe comment section below.\nWe appreciate hearing your stories.\nLeave a like and share\nthis video with a friend\nif you
