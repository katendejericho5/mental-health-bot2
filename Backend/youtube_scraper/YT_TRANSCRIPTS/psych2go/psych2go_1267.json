    "transcript": "- [Narrator] So here are five signs\nthat they are not interested\nin a relationship.\nNumber one, your crush\ndoesn't make an effort.\nEstablishing a relationship\nmeans that both parties\nneed to put in the effort.\nYou need to communicate,\nfigure out each other's\ninterests and hobbies,\nand spend time with each other.\nIn the early stages,\na romantic relationship\nmay begin as a friendship.\nHowever, the relationship changes\nwhen both people pay more attention\nto the small things about each other.\nInterest in each other\nstarts with simple questions,\nsuch as, \"Will they like this?\"\nThis question unravels\na slew of questions,\nwhich all point to one fact,\nyou want to know more about them\nbecause you've developed feelings.\nKeen attention to small\nand insignificant details\nmeans that you care about\nsomeone's well-being,\ncomfort, and opinion.\nIf your crush does not make an effort\nto know more about you and\nspend more time with you.\nthen they're likely not interested.\nNumber two, they talk\nabout their love life.\nThis sign is difficult to gauge,\nbecause it all depends on the tone.\nIf you're interested in someone,\nyou probably will not talk\nabout your love life with them.\nOf course, that doesn't apply to everyone.\nHowever, if your crush approaches you\nand wants to treat you as\na wingman or wingwoman,\nthere's a slim chance\nthat they're interested\nin you romantically.\nNumber three, they keep\nyou at an arm's length.\nWhen people fall in love,\nthey tend to reveal secrets\nthat they don't tell others.\nThey seek to establish emotional intimacy\nand welcome the other person\ninto their inner world.\nHowever, someone who is not\ninterested will not do that.\nThey may tell you things,\nbut they don't welcome you\ninto their private emotional life.\nNumber four, they flake out on plans.\nAnother sign that\nsomeone is not interested\nin a romantic relationship\nis flaking out on plans.\nFlaking out also refers\nto lacking commitment.\nWhen someone is in love,\nor at least interested,\nthey'll try to spend as\nmuch time as they can\nnear the person they like.\nHence, if your crush\nabruptly cancels plans,\nconsistently shows up late,\nand actively avoids making plans with you,\nthen they may not be interested.\nThen number five, they\nflirt with other people.\nThis is an obvious sign\nthat they're not interested.\nSome people may think\nthat the other person\nis playing hard to get,\nand that could be the case.\nPeople play hard to get to\nsee if others are interested.\nBut why would you chase after someone\nwho lures you in to play\naround with your feelings\nif it's obvious you're interested?\nIf your crush is constantly elusive,\nthen they might not like you the same way.\nDid you relate to any of these signs?\nFiguring out whether someone\nis interested in you is difficult.\nIf you are in an early\nphase of a relationship\nand are not sure if the\nother person is interested,\nnotice the way they act.\nCommunication is also key.\nIt's difficult to talk\nabout subjects like this,\nbut it can help both of you\navoid heartbreak down the line."
