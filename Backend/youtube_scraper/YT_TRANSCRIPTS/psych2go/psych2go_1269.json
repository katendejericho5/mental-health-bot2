    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nThe importance of being able\nto empathize with others\nis taught to us all at a young age.\nBut as we grow older,\nvalues like drive, ambition,\nand competitiveness\ncan come to replace empathy\nin today's success-oriented society.\nAnd as a result, empaths\nare often overlooked,\nmisunderstood, and undervalued\nin spite of their incredible gift\nto understand and connect with people\nin a much richer and deeper level.\nDefined as highly sensitive\nindividuals with a keen ability\nto sense the thoughts and\nfeelings of those around them,\nempaths are compassionate,\ninsightful, nurturing,\nand kind people.\nWanna know more about what certain traits\nand characteristics make an empath?\nWell, here are 10 telltale signs\nthat you are truly an empath.\nNumber one, you're highly intuitive.\nOne of the most notable\nthings about an empath\nis their incredible sense of intuition,\na rare and unique gift.\nEmpaths are easily able to sense\nwhat everyone else is feeling\nand read even the subtlest\ncues in their words,\nactions, and expressions\nall without even trying.\nSo if you tend to have\ngood instincts about people\nand strong gut reactions to things\nthat often turn out to be true,\nthen that is most likely\nbecause you are a full-fledged\nempath with good intuition.\nNumber two, you are\nhighly conflict-averse.\nThere are a few things\nan empath dreads more\nthan interpersonal conflict.\nIf it's between them and someone else,\nthey will most likely\navoid dealing with it\nfor as long as they can by\nacting like everything is fine.\nBut if they're caught in the middle\nof someone else's conflict,\nthat's about 10 times worse.\nBecause as an empath,\nthey just can't help but\nsympathize with both sides.\nNumber three, you're everyone's\ntherapist or a life coach.\nDo friends and family often\nturn to you for advice\nor confide in you about their problems?\nDo you sometimes start to feel\nlike you're more of a\ncounselor or a life coach\nthan a friend to most people?\nIf so, it's most likely\nbecause, as an empath,\npeople are drawn to your sensitive\nand compassionate nature.\nEmpaths are also known\nfor being good listeners,\nunderstanding friends,\nand just an overall comforting\npresence to be around.\nNumber four, you need time to recharge.\nAnother telltale sign that\nyou're truly an empath,\nyou sometimes need time to recharge\nand just get away from everybody\neven if you're an extrovert.\nThere are times when you feel suffocated\nby everyone else's thoughts and feelings\nthat it muddles your own\nand you can't seem to\nthink for yourself anymore.\nYou feel drained just\nby being around them,\nwhich brings us to the next point.\nNumber five, you tend to self-isolate.\nBeing alone and spending\ntime with yourself\nhelps empaths recover from the stress\nof constantly being bombarded\nwith other people's emotions all the time.\nBut for those who don't understand,\nit can easily be mistaken as a tendency\nto socially withdraw and self-isolate.\nSo your friends and family\nsometimes call you flaky\nand unreliable for this very reason.\nThis is a common struggle with empaths.\nNumber six, you dislike crowded spaces.\nIt's no surprise that\neven the most extroverted\nand outgoing of empaths\nwould dislike crowded spaces\nbecause of how they absorb both\npositive and negative energy\nfrom people just by being around them.\nSo being in a bustling\nbar or at a wild party\nwhere there are lots\nof people feeling a lot\nof different things is an\nalmost unbearable experience\nof sensory overload for empaths.\nNumber seven, you're\noverwhelmed by intimacy.\nNope, you're not afraid of commitment.\nAnd no, you don't have a\nfear of emotional intimacy.\nIt's just that when you're an empath,\nit feels like everyone\nis constantly being vulnerable around you\neven when they don't realize it.\nAnd it can be draining to spend\na lot of time around them,\nno matter how much they mean to you.\nYou often hear complaints\nfrom loved ones telling you,\n\"We don't talk enough,\"\nor that you're not spending\nas much time together\nas they'd like.\nNumber eight, you have\ndifficulty setting boundaries.\nEmpaths have a hard time knowing\nwhen to stop giving themselves to others,\nemotionally speaking.\nAnd they tend to prioritize\neveryone else's emotional well-being.\nBut setting boundaries helps\nempaths to minimize the burden\nof feeling everyone else's\nemotions all the time\nby giving them the time and\nspace they need to recharge.\nThe only problem is they're\ntoo afraid to bring it up\nbecause it might start a conflict.\nNumber nine,\nyou feel like you don't\nfit in a lot of the time.\nBecause genuine empaths are rare,\nit's easy for them to feel\nlike they don't really fit in\nanywhere a lot of the time.\nThey struggle to relate to most people.\nAnd in spite of being able to know\nand understand what they're\nfeeling all the time,\nthey're often misunderstood\nby those around them.\nAnd number 10, you have\na hard time not caring.\nLast but certainly not least,\nfinding it hard not to\ncare about something\nis perhaps the most obvious sign\nthat someone is truly an empath.\nAfter all, being highly attuned\nto other people's emotions\nhas its ups and downs.\nAnd this easily falls\ninto both categories:\nidealistic and altruistic.\nEmpaths struggle with their\nbleeding heart nature,\nand are often told they're\ntoo caring for their own good.\nThey feel compelled to\nhelp anyone in pain.\nAnd when they can't, it\neats away at their soul.\nThey're not like most people\nwho can just rationalize\ntheir way out of their guilt\nand inaction.\nSo, do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nHave you ever wondered\nif you were an empath,\nand did this video do anything\nto either confirm or\nrefute these suspicions?\nWhether you're an empath\nor know someone who is,\nthe bottom line is that empathy\nis a beautiful and precious gift\nthat doesn't get nearly as much\nappreciation as it deserves.\nAfter all, everyone has a\npart to play in this world,\nand empaths help to make it a better place\nin their own special way.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find use in this
