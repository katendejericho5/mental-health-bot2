    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have a nagging feeling\nthat some of the people who\nsay that they're your friends\ndon't really mean it?\nPerhaps you feel as if\nthey don't really want\nthe best for you or secretly\nwant you out of their group\nbut just won't come out and say it.\nA lot of the time when you dislike someone\nyou won't dare tell them directly\nin fear of confrontation.\nSo instead you may just let\nyour actions speak for you\nand hope they get the hint.\nSo if you've been\nwondering if the red flags\nyou've been seeing in some of your friends\nmean something serious, here\nare eight telltale signs\nthat can help you figure it out.\nNumber one, their body language\ntowards you is closed and negative.\nHave you noticed non-verbal cues they send\nwhenever you are together?\nAs much as you try to keep\nyour true feelings a secret\nthere are plenty of subconscious things\nyou do with your body that speak volumes\nabout how you really feel\nabout the people you're with.\nSome examples to keep a close eye on\ninclude crossed arms and\nlegs, minimal eye contact,\nphysical distance, and using\nbags, pillows, desks, doors\nand so on to hide behind\nwhile you're talking.\nNumber two they fake a smile around you.\nDo their smiles reach their eyes?\nAnother telltale sign that\nsomeone doesn't like you\nas much as they're letting on is\nif they're constantly faking\ntheir smiles around you.\nMost of the time when\npeople fake their smiles,\ntheir eyes don't crinkle\nand the rest of their face\nstays still while they do it.\nAnd while it can be difficult to tell\nif this is just because\nthey're tired, shy,\nor feeling a little awkward,\nif this person is more than\nan acquaintance to you already\nand you notice they're still\nfaking their smiles around you\nit might be because they\nsecretly dislike you.\nNumber three, they keep your conversations\nshort and impersonal.\nThink back on the last few times\nyou've spoken to this person.\nDid they seem in a hurry to leave?\nWere their replies short\nand devoid of emotion?\nWhen people secretly dislike you\nthey'll most likely try to avoid you\nand cut your conversation short\nby either giving you very vague answers\nlike \"I'm fine\" or \"Not much going on\"\nor \"It's all good\" or rushing\noff with a flimsy excuse,\nan empty promise of the next\ntime that never comes true.\nNumber four, there's a distinct\nlack of physical touch.\nwhile it's certainly true that some people\naren't as comfortable being touchy\nor physically affectionate\naround even their closest friends\nand loved ones, it's\nanother thing entirely\nwhen they're comfortable doing it\naround everyone except you.\nThe distinct lack of any kind\nof friendly physical touch,\nbe it a hug, handshake or pat\non the back is very telling\nthat they do not feel comfortable\nletting you into their personal space.\nNumber five, they don't\nmake any plans with you.\nCan you remember the last\ntime this particular person\nmade have plans with you\nor invited you somewhere?\nIf the answer is never\nthen it's probably time\nto take a good look\nat your friendship with this\nperson and ask yourself why.\nDo you invite them to places and events\nthey just end up canceling\nor postponing indefinitely?\nDo they often blow you\noff for the next cooler,\nmore exciting thing or exclude you\nfrom their plans with other friends?\nIt might sting a little to admit it,\nbut if so, there's a\ngood chance it's because\nthis person secretly dislikes you.\nNumber six, they rarely\nreach out or check up on you.\nSimilar to the last point,\nif the communication\nbetween you and this person\nis mostly one sided, then\nit's a red flag already.\nWhether it's leaving you unread,\nnot bothering to return your calls\nor never checking up on\nyou every now and then\nto make sure you're okay\nand see how you're doing,\nall of these behaviors\nshow indifference, apathy,\nand a definite lack of concern\nusually reserved for the\npeople we don't like.\nNumber seven, they tend to let you down\nand break their promises.\nAs cliche as it might sound,\na common adage you hear in\nfamily and couples therapy\nis if we don't have trust,\nwe don't have anything.\nMutual trust is really the foundation\nfor every healthy and\nlasting relationship.\nSo if someone is constantly\nletting you down,\nbreaking their promises\nand not being there\nwhen you need them to be,\nand as painful as it might be to admit\nall of these signs are telling you\nthat this person does not respect you,\nnor care about your feelings.\nAnd number eight, they don't\nlisten to your opinions.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nif someone can't be bothered to listen\nto what you have to say,\nsuch as when they make\ndecisions that affect you\nwithout asking you first or\ninsist on doing something\nyou've made very clear\nyou don't agree with,\nit's safe to say that this\nperson is probably harboring\nsome ill will against you.\nThis can manifest in other\nlittle passive aggressive ways too.\nLike never asking you\nwhat you feel like doing\nor always being on their\nphone while you're talking.\nAll these little things\nshow that this person\nis only pretending to like you\nand that they don't actually\nvalue or respect your opinion.\nIs there someone you think\nwho secretly dislikes you?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe\nand share it with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe
