    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Narcissism is a buzzword\nused quite a lot in modern day.\nIt's possible that we have\nall known or been involved\nwith somebody who has narcissistic traits,\nat some point in our lives.\nIt's even possible that some of you\nmay have had an narcissist\nas a romantic partner.\nIf you have, then you may resonate\nwith some of the points\nhighlighted in this video.\nFor those who don't know\nmuch about narcissism\nthen this video will hopefully\nprovide some insight.\nHere are 11 things narcissists never do.\n(upbeat music)\nNumber one,\nthey will never apologize to\nyou or admit they were wrong.\nSince the narcissist\nnever takes responsibility\nfor their actions, words, or feelings,\nwhat is there to apologize for?\nSome of you may feel like\nyou have had an apology,\nbut you'll never get a real\napology from an narcissist.\nYou might hear something\nalong the lines of,\n\"I'm sorry that you feel that way,\"\nwhich puts the\nresponsibility back onto you.\nIt's more likely that the, \"I'm sorry,\"\nrelates to them being\nsorry that they got caught\nand that this is more\nof an issue for them,\nthan actually being sorry\nfor whatever it is they did.\nAny apology will be rushed,\nand the conversation changed,\nso that the incident is\nbrushed under the rug.\nNumber two, they'll never tell the truth.\nThere are two different types of truth\nwhen it comes to a narcissist.\nTelling the truth, which they seldom do,\nand their truth, which is\ntheir version of the truth.\nNarcissist need to convince\nthemselves of certain things\nand can get easily offended\nwhen they get knocked off\ntheir pedestal that exists\nin their dream world.\nThey will proclaim that they are so loved,\nso important and so special.\nSo when a piece of reality\nreminds them of the real truth\nthis can be quite devastating for them.\nThey'll always have their\nown version of events.\nNumber three, they'll never\nforgive or make peace.\nFor the same reason the\nnarcissist does not apologize,\nthey also never forgive.\nAny kind of hurt is a cause\nfor retaliation and revenge.\nThe narcissist is always\nfighting for their survival,\nas life is a battle zone in their eyes,\nwhere everybody is potentially\nout to attack them.\nIf someone apologizes to them,\nnarcissists see it as\nproof of their superiority.\n(upbeat music ends)\nGenuine forgiveness\nis not a part of the\nnarcissists emotional lexicon,\nfundamentally because the narcissist\ncannot forgive themselves.\nNeedless to say, they will\nnever win the Nobel Peace Prize\nin relationships.\nThey thrive on constant, chronic chaos.\nNumber four, they will not listen to you.\nEver feel like you're\nnot being listened to\nwhen you're talking about your day,\nor when you're in an argument?\nChances are you're probably right.\nNarcissists tend to prefer\nthe sound of their own voices,\nso they don't hear,\nand probably won't want\nto hear you either.\nThey know that this will make you agitated\nand eventually wear you down.\nBe mindful of circular conversations\nthat you have with them,\nas this will indicate\nthat they have not listened\nto previous conversations with you.\nNumber five, they will\nnot take responsibility.\nEver heard, \"It's not my\nfault, you made me do this,\"\nand, \"I would never do that.\"\nNarcissists are particularly sensitive\nto shame, blame, and\ntheir identities are built\nagainst feelings of invalidation.\nAccepting responsibility of any kind\ntriggers the narcissists threat\nof exposure to criticism.\nNarcissists prefer to play the victim\nand will instead project\nresponsibilities onto others\nwithin their sphere of\npower, such as a partner,\nor their children.\nNumber six, they will not seek\nhelp or professional support.\nHave you ever worried about\nwhether you're a narcissist?\nFret not.\nIf you worry about this question,\nthe answer is probably no.\nSelf reflection and introspection\nare something a narcissist wouldn't do.\nWhy?\nWell, it's possible that\nthere is a little child\nhidden within them who is damaged\nand experiences feelings of inadequacy.\nThis is where the narcissist\novercompensates for them.\nThey need this side of\nthem in order to survive.\nFor the narcissist, self-reflection\nis a dangerous territory\nto be avoided at all costs,\nbecause it represents vulnerability.\nSeeking any kind of support\nsuggests that they have a problem,\nwhich is something they\ndo not believe they have.\nNumber seven, they don't address\nthe difficulties they have\nwith emotional stability and manipulation.\nThere is no denying that they are clever,\nparticularly at manipulating people\nand spotting their vulnerabilities.\nThey tend to engage primarily\nin black and white thinking.\nThey tend to either\nidealize or devalue others.\nThis can lead to a\npattern of codependency,\nespecially within romantic relationships.\nThey're not concerned with\nthe emotional consequences\nof others, due to\nimpaired empathic traits.\nEmotionally healthy beings\nwill experience emotions\non a daily basis.\nWhereas this is lost to the narcissist,\nwho is often trapped in their own lonely,\nself-protective construction of reality.\nNumber eight, they will\nnot act selflessly.\nSelflessness is the\nantithesis of narcissism.\nThis is due to their\nlacking sense of empathy\nand inflated sense of entitlement.\nNarcissists, by definition,\nare locked in an inward spiral,\nwhere they experience a\ngrandiose sense of self,\nputting themselves at the top\nof the emotional food chain.\nThey will do things,\nwhich from the outset,\nlook like they're doing a good deed,\nbut they create the\nadmiration that is attached\nto doing that good deed.\nThey wanna be congratulated\nas this feeds their need for validation.\nSo they won't do things that\ndon't offer them something\nin return.\nNumber nine, they will not provide you\nwith any sense of safety.\n\"It's me and you against the world,\"\nsaid a narcissist, never.\nThis is not how a narcissist operates.\nThey need you scared and insecure\nat the prospect of losing them.\nThey'll also be using a lot\nof gas lighting to confuse you\nand make you question yourself.\nThey may convince us that we cannot leave,\nor that we cannot find anybody better.\nYou won't feel safe.\nAnd frankly, you're not.\nNumber 10, they will not let you go.\nThey will never stop\nthinking that they own you,\nuntil you're replaced.\nA narcissist will not be done with you\nuntil you have served a purpose,\nit doesn't matter if you feel\nlike you're done with them.\nThe narcissist needs you as\na planet, circling their sun,\nto feel good about themselves.\nAnd number 11, they won't change.\nChange is possible for anybody.\nIf they really want it.\nThis is where it's difficult\nfor the narcissist.\nUnless they're willing to\naccept that there is a problem\nwith their behavior, they're\nnever going to address it.\nSimple as that. There has to\nbe a genuine want to change.\nSo, did this video explain a\nbit more about narcissists?\nIf you've been affected\nby any of the points\ndiscussed in this video and\nfeel comfortable sharing,\nplease leave a comment or\nconfide in somebody you trust.\nIt's also important to\nremember that narcissist traits\ncan also be linked to\npersonality disorders,\nwhich may go undiagnosed for a long time.\nSo make sure not to make assumptions.\n(waves crashing)\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat find use in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThank you so much for\nwatching and we'll see.\n(waves crashing)"
