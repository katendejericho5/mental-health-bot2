    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you know someone\nwho changed their behavior abruptly?\nAre they now easily\nangered and often talking\nabout depressing things?\nEvery person has a different\nreaction to trauma and pain.\nThis is why it's good to\nlearn in advance about it\nand what to do when the situation arises.\nSo here are six signs to look out for\nif you think someone is secretly in pain.\nNumber one, they become silent.\nDo you notice your friend or family member\nsuddenly goes uncharacteristically quiet\nwhere they no longer\nreply to your messages,\ndon't engage in social media,\nor don't communicate with\nyou the way they used to?\nIt might be that they're\nintroverted in nature,\nbut there's a difference\nbetween being introverted\nand a sudden change in behavior.\nIf you feel like there's something wrong,\nthere's a chance they're\nfacing a personal problem\nand hurting inside.\nPeople usually withdraw\nfrom social interactions\ndue to past trauma,\nwhich is a form of\nprotection and prevention\nagainst any emotional triggers\nor problematic situations.\nThey feel safer when they're alone\neven if it comes at the\ncost of isolating themselves\naway from their own friend groups.\nBut although space is important,\nsocial isolation can be dangerous.\nStudies have found that\nsocial isolation increases\nthe risk for health problems,\nto the same degree as abusing alcohol\nor smoking 15 cigarettes a day.\nWhen you know someone\nwho is acting like this,\nit's important to reach out to them\neven though it may be uncomfortable\nand you may receive a negative reaction.\nTell them that you're there for them\nand you're ready to listen to them\nif they would like to open up.\nNumber two, they lash out.\nWhen someone is in pain, they\ntend to become short tempered.\nThey may become easily\nirritated and possibly lash out\nor push you away when\nyou reach out to them.\nBut try to understand that\nthis behavior is normal\nand they're coming from a place of hurt.\nAnd they're doing this\nbecause they don't know\nhow to process their pain\nin a healthy way.\nSo they project it outwards.\nSo your response is the most\nimportant thing to consider.\nLashing back at them\nwould only make it worse\nand cause them to withdraw further.\nInstead, try to give them space\nso that you can still help\nthem when they need it.\nYou can choose to stay silent\nor talk it out with them.\nTell them how you feel\nand that you understand\nwhere they're coming from.\nNumber three, they become reckless.\nDo you notice the person engaging\nin destructive, risky behavior?\nSometimes it's good to take risks,\nand they can help you become\nstronger and more confident.\nHowever, if someone is\nbeing oddly reckless\nor more rash than usual,\nthey're most likely using\nit as a defense mechanism,\nor an escape from being hurt.\nSometimes it's smoking,\ndrinking, and binge eating.\nOther times, it maybe\nthey no longer take baths,\ndon't care about personal hygiene,\nand refuse to clean their rooms.\nIf someone you know is behaving like this,\nit helps to talk it out with them,\nor find alternative activities.\nThere will be times when\nthey don't wanna talk.\nSo if they would rather do something else,\nyou can join them or encourage them\nto watch a movie, play video games,\nor other stuff to help take\ntheir mind off of things.\nNumber four, they talk\nabout dark topics a lot.\nHave they ever mentioned\ndeath or being useless,\nand things like that?\nEven though it may be alarming,\nit doesn't necessarily\nmean that they're suicidal,\nbut it always helps to ask\nif they wanna talk about it.\nPeople who are facing\nemotional disturbance\nor past trauma tend to feel hopeless\nand are more likely to think\nabout their own lives and their meaning.\nIf that's the case,\ntry reaching out to them regularly\nand be by their side,\nsupporting and encouraging\nthem to seek help if needed.\nNumber five, they become\nincreasingly paranoid.\nDo you notice them nitpicking everything\nor becoming more cynical?\nRepressed, emotional pain can resurface\nin the form of paranoia and anxiety\nbecause they don't wanna be triggered\nby previous traumatic experiences.\nFor example, they may not wanna hang out\nwith their friends anymore\nbecause they're reminded of\na big fight that happened.\nSo they may become anxious\nabout meeting people\nand develop trust issues.\nTry to keep your mind open and\nput yourself in their shoes.\nIf you were in their\nsituation, how would you react?\nIt's critical to not\ndismiss their paranoia.\nValidate their feelings\nand tell them that\nyou'll be there for them.\nAnd number six, they're always tired.\nDo you notice your friends\nsleeping a lot or looking tired?\nWhen people experience a\nbad or traumatic event,\nthey can have aftershock reactions\nsuch as concentration\ndifficulty and fatigue.\nThey might not wanna get out of bed, eat,\nand take care of themselves.\nWhen this happens,\nit's good to let them do the things\nthat feel natural to them.\nIt's important that they get a lot of rest\nand know that their support\ngroup is within reach.\nIf they don't wanna eat,\ntry offering to feed them\nor try cooking them food.\nRecovery may take a while.\nAnd it may vary from person to person,\nbut if they know you're\nthere for assistance,\nthe impact on their healing\nprocess is significant.\nDo you know someone who is\ndisplaying these symptoms?\nIf so, there's always something\nyou can do to help them.\nAnd if you are the one who's in pain,\nplease remember that others\nare available to help.\nIf you know people who may\nrelate or learn from this,\nplease share it with them.\nThe references
