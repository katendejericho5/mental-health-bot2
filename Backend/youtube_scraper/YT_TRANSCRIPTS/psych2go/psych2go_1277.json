    "transcript": "(upbeat music)\n- Have you ever had days\nwhere all you wanted to do\nwas lie down and do nothing.\nYou felt like you've lost\nyour sense of direction in life,\nand didn't know what else to do.\n- Of course you have,\nbecause we've all had our off days.\nWe've all felt lazy,\nunmotivated and uninspired\nfrom time to time,\nwe live in such a cutthroat\nhyper-competitive society.\nThat's so obsessed with\nthe pursuit of wealth\nand success that it's made us feel guilty\nfor the time we spend not earning money\nor doing something productive\n- Living a life with this kind of pressure\ncan create a chronic level of stress,\nif we constantly overwork ourselves\nand is bound to have some adverse effects\non our mental and emotional wellbeing.\n- But what if it's more than that?\nWhat if your laziness is more\nthan just emotional burnout?\nWhat if it's already become\nsomething much more serious?\nWell, with that said\nhere are six warning signs\nto help you figure that out.\nLaziness can creep up on us\nwhen we have something important to do\nor if we've been working\nourselves too hard for too long,\nbut depression,\ndepression, isn't a choice,\nand it's definitely not something\nyou can just shake off or get over,\noftentimes depressive episodes reoccur\nthroughout a patient's life.\nSo months of therapy may be required.\n- [Katrina] Another clear\nsign is you often struggle\nwith feelings of unexplained,\nloneliness, sadness\nand hopelessness, along with it.\nNot only are you exhausted\nand low in energy\nbut you also feel\ndowncast and disheartened\nfor reasons you don't understand\nwhen you're battling depression\nnot even doing the things\nyou used to love the most\nor spending time with your loved ones\ncan make you feel better.\n- [Noah] If your laziness\nhas made you lose motivation\nand interest in everything,\nnot just school or work\nthen something can be seriously wrong.\nPeople suffering from\ndepression tend to lose interest\nin their hobbies and emotionally withdraw\nfrom those around them.\n- [Katrina] Do you feel that your laziness\nis getting out of hand?\nHas it become too much for you to manage?\nIs it getting in the way of your work\nyour school or your personal life?\nIf you answered yes to\nany one of these questions\nthen you may be dealing with\ndepression, not laziness.\nPsychologists tend to look\nfor the four Ds of abnormality\nthat is deviance, distress,\ndanger and dysfunction.\nSo if your laziness is\nsignificantly interfering\nwith your everyday tasks\nand living your life,\nthen it may be time to see\na mental healthcare professional about it.\nOftentimes laziness\nmanifest as procrastination\nand may be caused by a\nnumber of different reasons.\nSome believe it reflects\na lack of self-esteem\nwhile others would argue\nit's because of a lack of\npositive recognition by others.\n- It could also be due\nto a lack of discipline,\nself-control, and interest.\nBut what about depression?\nWhat brings about depression?\nWell, the truth is\npsychologists don't really know.\n- So if you are feeling\ndown, disheartened,\nor feeling unenergetic all of a sudden\nthis may be the reason why.\n- [Noah] Finally, but\nperhaps most important\nthe key difference between\ndepression and laziness\nis that laziness is changeable\nwhile depression isn't.\nIf you're feeling tired and unmotivated\nyou can do something about it.\nYou can get some rest and try out\ndifferent productivity\nhacks to help you get\nout of your funk.\nBut with depression, it's not that easy.\nAnyone who's experienced\nclinical depression\nwill tell you that\nif they had the choice to\nsnap themselves out of it\nthey would do it in an instant.\nIn fact, patients with depression,\noften report feelings of extreme guilt,\nshame, and helplessness as well.\nSo don't ever say that\nanyone with depression\nis just doing it for attention.\nMental illness is so much more than that.\n- So do you relate to any\nof the signs mentioned here?\nhave you been feeling\nextremely lazy lately\nand wondering if anything is more serious?\n- If you or anyone you know\nare experiencing serious\nfeelings of depression\ndon't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental healthcare\nprofessional and get help today\nbecause the earlier we\ncan diagnose depression\nthe easier it is to treat.\n(upbeat music)"
