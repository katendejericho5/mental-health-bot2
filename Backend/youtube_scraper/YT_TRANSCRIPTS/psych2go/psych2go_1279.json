    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nThe only consistency in life is change.\nThis goes for your mental health as well.\nYou will have good days,\nas well as bad ones.\nAnd that's the regular course of things.\nIt's also common that there\nare subtle shifts that occur\nyou may not readily notice.\nSo although you can't just\nstay better in a static state,\nthis also means you won't\njust stay down either.\nAnd let's try to keep all\nthose down times under control,\nby being able to recognize\nthe signs of struggle.\nHere are a few things to look out for.\n(traditional Chinese music)\nNumber one, you experience\na drop in brain functioning.\nThis one can be tough\nbecause your brain is your command center\nand is the very organ used\nto recognize the other signs.\nSo this sign requires a\ngood sense of self-awareness\nand being able to look at\none's self from the outside.\nMany of us aren't used to doing this,\nbut it's a good activity to practice\nas it can be applied to helping\nwith other mental health issues as well.\nWhen you can train yourself\nto mentally hang out\non the outside of yourself and observe,\nyou might notice behaviors and activities\nthat aren't the norm for you.\nSigns include getting\ndistracted more frequently,\nbeing consistently in brain fog.\nAnd you've been implementing\nlogical solutions,\nlike, I'm sure a cheeseburger\nwill make everything better.\nIt's easy to write these\noff as momentary lapses.\nThere's a big review this week,\nso I didn't get much sleep,\nfor example, and sure you might be right.\nHowever, maybe don't\ntotally just dismiss this\nas it's happened enough that\nyou are now taking the step\nto observe yourself from the outside.\nTake note, even if they're physical notes\nto help you remember,\nas these may well also\nbe subtle signs that your mental state\nis sliding down the slippery slope.\nNumber two, you isolate\nyourself from others.\nHave you noticed that\nyour happy alone-time\nis getting to be more of a 24/7 thing,\nrather than simply the\nrelaxing end of your day\nor the occasional weekend with a book?\nAgain, is it more than your normal?\nIsolating yourself is more\nthan being socially distant.\nSocial isolation is that next level\nwhere you're putting in active\neffort to avoid other people,\nnot just, nah, had a rough week tired,\nas in you are now\ncreating methods and plans\nfor the purpose of issuing\nhuman social activity.\nWhen it gets to this point\nyou're deliberately\nmarginalizing yourself.\nSelf marginalization can\nlead you to a phobia.\nIn which case, we\nencourage you to reach out\nto a professional if you require help.\nBut can also be to you\nto your mental health.\nWhen the issue is from your mental health\nit's more a state of suffering in silence.\nFeeling annoyed and tired\nat having to pretend happy\nwhen you go out.\nYou also find that you've lost interest\nin previously enjoyable things.\nNumber three, you have low energy.\nYeah. Low energy is a sign.\nTo make it a sign though, it\nhappens often or is consistent.\nThe reason is that\nalthough you're not doing\nthe physical decathlon\nmarathon CrossFit course,\ninternally you sure are.\nYour emotions and feelings\nare in some turmoil\nand you're mentally\nplaying referee, mediator,\nand internal counselor to\nhold yourself together.\nAlthough no specific cause\nfor the overlap in fatigue\nand psychiatric disorders\nhas been found as of yet,\none can't deny the tiredness.\nWe understand that being so exhausted,\nplus dealing with life stuff\nis ultimately draining,\nand it can be extra\ndifficult to figure out\nif this is mental health or not.\nSo reach out to a\nprofessional for a clear,\nmedically supported view\nand appropriate treatment.\nYou do deserve to feel 3D and not 2D.\nAnd number four, you really\ndon't feel like yourself.\nThis is a bit of an abstract sign\nthat is difficult to give\na concrete description.\nOne description is that you're a SIM,\nwaiting for the next task to be assigned\nby the power outside, and then realizing\nyou're also the power outside.\nBut the power suddenly lost\nconnectivity to the controls.\nSo you can't control SIM you.\nYou're experiencing episodes\nof what's called depersonalization\nor derealization.\nIt's a dissociative feeling\nwhere things just feel off,\nand you feel like you're\nalong for the ride\nin your own body.\nAnd it's happening more than usual.\nPerhaps you're getting too\nmired in your own thoughts,\nbut you can also easily get swept away\nin a wave of emotions,\ndoubts and negative thoughts,\nso much so that you forget who you are.\nSo what do you do when you feel\nlike you're floating away involuntarily?\nFind something tangible\nand solid that grounds you\nwhere you are.\nIt could be the feeling\nof ice in your hands,\nlistening to your breaths,\nessentially whatever helps you\ncome back into your physical being.\nOnce you've landed though, take a moment,\ntake deep, soul filling\nbreaths and take stock.\nIt is normal to be a little freaked out,\nnot knowing where you are.\nAs with all of our information bits,\nwe're super happy you're\nwatching and learning.\nWhile at the same time,\nplease don't take our word for everything.\nThere are very qualified\nprofessionals out there\nwho can give proper guidance.\nWe're definitely not\nhere to take their place.\nIf you recognize any of these symptoms,\nfeel free to comment, share,\nor even ask more questions.\nWe'll catch you in the next video.\nTake care, stay safe and so much love."
