    "transcript": "- [Amanda] That word, lazy,\nit's an insulting and negative trait.\nIt's a voluntary purposeful\ndecision to not act\ndespite being perfectly capable\nand in favorable circumstances to do so\noften for petty and selfish reasons.\nEmotional exhaustion is not voluntary.\nIt can be disabling,\nand it can't just be turned off.\nIt's one of the signs of\nburnout involving your psyche\nand emotions feeling like\na deflated scrapyard tire.\nSo how can you tell if\nit's emotional exhaustion?\nWell, let's take a look at some signs.\nNumber one, you can't\nseem to get work done,\nbut you normally do or learn something\neven if it's small.\nNow, though, it's like you blank out\nat your workstation all day.\nAnd okay, you're home\nagain, what happened?\nThinking back carefully,\nemotional exhaustion may be a play.\nUnlike your usual self,\nyou were easily sidetracked\nand all your regular tasks\nfelt like monumental hurdles.\nMaybe you missed several\nimportant deadlines\ndespite knowing they were there.\nIt's like everything is just one gray wash\nand you simply can't focus\nor bring yourself to\nbe into any one thing.\nOne day of this could stem\nfrom that all-night gaming session.\nMost days of this happening\nfor more than a few weeks,\nthat could be emotional exhaustion.\nNumber two, you're so tired,\nbut you haven't really done anything.\nYou're puzzled, falling\nasleep has been fine.\nYou're not waking up throughout the night.\nMaybe you've even had\npower naps during the day,\nyet you're still moving\nand thinking like you're\ntrapped in thickened pudding.\nThis could well be emotional\nexhaustion trying to get you\nto slow the heck down\nand enact some self care.\nYou might have been ignoring\nyour wants and needs\nwith all energy going\nto others or to work.\nWhatever it is,\nthis is a reminder to take\ncare of your emotional health.\nJournaling, talking to\na sympathetic friend,\nor maybe a therapist can help\nto restore what sleep can't.\nYou also may not have had time to yourself\nfor inner peace moments.\nSo meditation or even a\nlong hot bath might help.\nNumber three, this isn't good enough.\nNothing is good enough.\nYou're finding that suddenly\nyou aren't satisfied\nwith anything you do.\nHow could you have thought before\nthat that little error was, well, little?\nIt's huge, oh my goodness.\nYou're starting to spiral.\nYou just know this is\ngonna get you canned.\nThis is emotional exhaustion.\nHello, I believe we've met.\nYup, weirdly enough,\nemotional exhaustion\nseems to make a person\nan uber-perfectionist nightmare.\nThings you just dealt with before,\nnow it all really bugs you,\nleading to more and\nmore things bugging you.\nAnd it all feels catastrophic.\nYou berate yourself for the\nsmallest perceived error,\nself-criticizing like a torture master\nthat feeds shame, fear, and sadness,\nwhich means more mistakes.\nYep, do you see where\nthat goes, nowhere good.\nSo if you start to see\nyourself ramp up the self-hate,\ngetting stuck to the point\nwhere you're constantly\nfrustrated to tears,\nand completely unsatisfied\nwith everything,\nthat's a sign that says take a step back.\nYou can do it.\nYou have your own history and\nevidence around you to prove\nthat this is unusual,\nthat you're still doing\nthe same good job you\nwere doing a month ago.\nIt's telling you it might be\ntime to care for yourself.\nMaybe reach out for help to\nguide you back to a good place.\nNumber four, you feel\nirrationally irritable.\nEmotional exhaustion leaves\nyou raw and vulnerable\nto stressors that you'd\nnormally handle with ease,\nleading to nervousness.\nNo longer the calm rock of resilience,\nyou're now always on edge,\nyour mind twitching on\nfight or flight mode.\nEverything feels more\nthreatening and insulting.\nAs such, you may find\nyourself interpreting\neven the most neutral\nexchanges and actions\nas offensive or shady.\nYou wanna lash out like a cornered animal.\nOof, that could bite you back pretty hard.\nYou know who you are.\nYou might even feel\nyourself snapping at someone\nand simultaneously inside screaming,\n\"What is wrong?\nWhy are

reason.\nThis affects food intake.\nMaybe you couldn't be bothered\nto think about real food\nso that bag of nachos sure sounds great.\nActually, the last four nights\nin a row were like that.\nOr you cruised on autopilot\nand ate a dinner of potato chips\nand two marshmallows, what?\nAt bedtime, you might find\nthat your body is so tired\nbut you can't get sleepy.\nOr you just don't haul yourself\nto bed at a normal hour.\nWhat day is it again?\nAll these things contribute\nto low mood and brain fog,\nwhich makes it even harder\nto seize your get-up-and-go\nwhen your day starts.\nAnd
