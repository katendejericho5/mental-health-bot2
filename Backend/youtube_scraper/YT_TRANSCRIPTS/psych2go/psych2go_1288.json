    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers. Welcome back.\nSpoken word Poet Connor Franta once said,\n\"It is not darkness in my heart\nbut emptiness, waiting for the sun.\"\nAnd if you find yourself\nrelating to this quote,\nthen you've most likely\nrealized the terrifying truth\nthat the emptiness and\nmeaninglessness of life\nis something a lot of us had to confront\nat some point in our lives.\nWhether it's all just a part of growing up\nand trying to figure out who\nyou are and where you belong,\nwe all find ourselves wondering\nhow to make sense of it all\nand discovering what we were\nput on this earth to do.\nWith that said, if you are\nstruggling with deep feelings\nof emptiness in your life right now,\nhere are seven signs to\nhelp you figure out why\nand what you can do about it:\n(animation thuds)\nNumber one, your relationships\naren't fulfilling.\nDo you often find yourself spending time\nwith people you don't even like?\nOr having uninteresting conversations\nwhere you just nod along and\npretend to act interested?\nOr date people you don't even\nhave any real feelings for\njust because you don't\nwanna turn them down?\nOne of the longest and most\nfamous studies on happiness\nknown as the Harvard Study\nof Adult Development found\nthat it was the quality\nof our relationships;\nmeaning the level of\nemotional intimacy, support,\nand active listening that\ndetermined our life satisfaction\nand sense of well-being, not the quantity.\nSo leave behind all the\nunfulfilling relationships\nin your life to make room\nfor better ones to come.\nNumber two, you struggle\nwith overdependence.\nAnother telltale sign\nyou might be feeling deep\nemptiness in your life\nis if you often find\nyourself overly dependent,\nneedy, and clinging to those around you.\nYou might be jumping from\none relationship to another\nbecause deep down inside you feel like\nsomething is missing in your life\nand you think other people\ncan feel that void for you.\nYou're scared to be alone\nbecause you don't know who you are\nwhen you're not defined\nby your relationship.\nOther people give you your\nsense of identity and self-worth\nand without them, you can't\nhelp but feel lost and empty.\nNumber three, you are\nperpetually bored with your life.\n\"I am going out of my mind with boredom.\nI don't know what I\nwanna do with my life.\"\nIs this something you\nfind yourself feeling\nor thinking a lot of the time?\nAre most of your days\nuninteresting and unengaging?\nDo you feel like you're\njust wasting your life\nand all your potential\nunable to find anything\nthat brings you joy or meaning?\nWhen people feel a deep\nemptiness in their life,\nit can look a lot like boredom.\nAnd that feeling comes\nfrom a lack of engagement,\nchallenge, change, and\nopportunities for self-growth.\nNumber four, you feel\nemotionally numb a lot.\nAlthough the people\naround you often remark\nthat you seem sad or down lately,\nthe truth is most days\nyou have trouble feeling\nanything at all.\nWhere there was once joy,\nsadness, excitement, and interest,\nthere's now apathy and\nemotional detachment.\nWhile a lot of people do\nexperience emotional detachment\nat certain points in their lives,\nit usually just kind of comes and goes.\nSo if the feeling or lack thereof it\nhas stuck with you for a while now,\nit's most likely a sign\nthat you're becoming aware\nof a deep emptiness you feel in your life.\nNumber five, you feel alone and\nisolated from everyone else.\nThe heavy feeling of life's emptiness,\nmeaninglessness and incompleteness\ncan drive us away from\nthe people around us,\neven those we love the most.\nYou might be feeling disconnected\nfrom everyone around you\nand struggling with a\ndeep sense of loneliness\nthat keeps you from emotionally\nconnecting with others.\nThis becomes even more evident\nonce you start avoiding people,\ncanceling plans and hiding\naway to be by yourself\nfor long periods of time.\nNumber six, you've lost\ntouch with yourself.\nLonging for something more\nbut not knowing what it is\nis one of the clearest\nand most telltale signs\nthat you've lost touch with yourself\nand are now living out of\nalignment with your purpose.\nYou don't know who you are\nanymore or what you want\nand you're painfully unsure\nabout where your life is going.\nAnd until you reconnect\nwith your inner self\nand once again rediscover\nyour purpose in life,\na deep sense of emptiness tends to set in.\nAnd number seven, you have what you want\nand you're still not happy.\nOn paper, it might seem\nlike you have a lot\nto be grateful for\nbut deep down inside,\nyou know that something is still missing.\nIf you find that you have what you want\nand you're still not happy,\nthen it's most likely going to leave you\nfeeling disheartened, confused,\nunsure of yourself and empty.\nThis might be because all\nthose wonderful things\naren't actually things\nyou wanted for yourself\nbut rather, what everyone else\nhas decided for you to want.\nDiscovering your core values\nand what your personal mission in life is\ncan help you get back on the right track.\nSo did you find yourself relating\nto any of the things we mentioned here?\nHopefully, even if the answer is yes,\nsome of the things we've mentioned\nmay help cultivate more meaning\nand purpose in your life.\nAnd if you or anyone else you know\nis seriously struggling with\nyour mental and well-being,\nplease seek help\nand talk to a mental\nhealthcare professional today.\nGetting in touch with the right person\ncan be a great first step\nto getting back on track.\nWhat are some things that you've learned?\nWhat's something you\nwish to learn more about?\nWhat's been your experience?\nWrite them down in the comments.\nAs always, thanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you in the next video."
