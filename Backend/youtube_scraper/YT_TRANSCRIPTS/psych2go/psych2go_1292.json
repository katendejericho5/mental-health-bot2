you already\nwithout you even realizing it so what do\nyou do well if you've fallen for someone\nspecial and are wondering if they feel\nthe same way or have a friend sending\nyou subtle signs you want to be careful\nnot to read too much into here are eight\nsigns you need to look out for to make\nsense of it all number one they want to\nspend time with you have they asked to\nmeet up with you more frequently one of\nthe more obvious signs that someone has\ncaught feelings for you is when they\nstart wanting to be around you more\nwhether it means having late night\nconversations weekend dates or coming to\nsee you every chance they get they may\nactively seek you out maintain contact\nand make plans with you it doesn't even\nmatter to them what you do so long as\nyou're together after all when someone\njust can't seem to get enough of you\nthen you'll know when their head over\nheels in love with you number two they\nhang on to every word you say\ndo they always want to talk to you or\nactively listen when you do another\nundeniable sign that someone has fallen\nfor you is if they hang on to every word\nyou say this may mean that they ask you\na lot of questions always want to know\nyour thoughts and feelings and make sure\nthey give you their full attention\nwhenever you're together\nnumber three they love to tell people\nabout you\ndo they show you off to their friends\nwhether it's talking about something\nyou've said what you did together or how\nthey feel about you if your partner is\nextroverted and outgoing they may\nprobably find it hard to stop themselves\nfrom talking to their friends about you\neven if they're more private and\nreserved they'll probably still do the\nsame with their trusted loved ones\neither way if you catch them saying a\nlot of nice things about you even when\nyou're not around then it's a good sign\nthat they really love you\nnumber four they show you extra care and\nattention\ndoes your partner often surprise you\nwith thoughtful little gifts or acts of\nservice did they show you a lot of\nphysical affection or Leave You long\ntexts and handwritten notes\nno matter what their love language might\nbe if your significant other is showing\nyou a lot more special care and\nattention than usual then it meets their\nfeelings for you are deepening number\nfive they're quick to agree with you\npsychology says that the more strongly\nand positively you feel about someone\nthe more you'll want to put your best\nfoot forward for them and make a good\nimpression and one of the most common\nand often unconscious ways you do this\nis by agreeing with them a lot so if\nyour partner is suddenly showing more\ninterest in the things you like and\nbeing more open to trying new things\nwith you then this might be why number\nsix they easily empathize with you\nanother tried and tested sign that\nsomeone is falling for you is if they\neasily empathize with you and are more\nattuned to your wants needs and feelings\nthis means when you feel sad they will\ntoo in the same way that they'll share\nyour happiness excitement and so on\ntheir heightened empathy for you can\nalso manifest as protectiveness or\nloyalty\nso you may hear more things like you\nhave to be more careful I'm worried\nabout you or I don't like them anymore\nbecause of the way they treated you\nnumber seven they prioritize you\nhave you ever noticed how your friends\ntend to spend less time hanging out with\nyou whenever they get into a new\nrelationship well the same goes for your\npartner too if you notice them spending\nmore time with you than they do with\ntheir friends rearranging their\nschedules to make time for you or even\ncanceling their plans the last minute\njust to be there for you when you need\nthem then it's safe to say that they\ncare deeply about you and have you as\ntheir priority\nand number eight they want a future with\nyou\nfinally but perhaps most importantly if\nyour significant other sees a future\nwith you then that's a clear message as\nany that they're in love with you even\nif they don't outrightly say it making\nplans far into the future with you\nasking a lot of what if questions like\nwhat if we got a dog or what if I move\nsomewhere closer to your place thinking\nmore in terms of us and we instead of I\nand me all of these signs mean that they\nlove making you a part of their life and\nthat they see a bright and happy future\nahead for your relationship\nis there someone you think is falling in\nlove with you let us know in the\ncomments below if
