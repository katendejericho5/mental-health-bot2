    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych2goers welcome back\nare you worried that you'll live a life\nfull of regrets when you're older\nmost adults have had at least one\nexperience good or bad where they wish\nthey could go back and do things a\nlittle differently\nwell to help you learn from their\nexperiences here are the top 10 regrets\nof life by those who are in their old\nage\nnumber one leaping into a relationship\ntoo fast\none common regret shared by many elderly\npeople is jumping into relationships too\nfast this is especially about\nrelationships with people who have\nvastly different personalities than them\nmany elderly folks have noted that while\npeople of opposite personalities bring\nenjoyment to their lives it doesn't\nalways bode well as a long lasting\ncommitment\naccording to peter bustin and stephen t\nelman of cornell university\nmost people actually prefer having a\npartner that shares similar\ncharacteristics to them so while it can\nbe fun for a short while in the long run\nyou're more likely to gravitate towards\npeople who are similar to you\nnumber two\ndrifting apart from family or friends\ndo you know a family member who's\nestranged their child\noftentimes these parents end up carrying\na sense of shame stress and feelings of\nisolation once they're older\neven if it happened many years ago\nestrangement can still have an effect on\nboth members today\nsometimes even impacting their mental\nwell-being in the long run\nfor these relationships reconciliation\nand forgiveness may help resolve the\nissue and overcome the negative feelings\nthey may have for each other\nbut it only works if both parties\nreciprocate it\nnumber three not expressing your\nemotions\nlike many you may think your biggest\nregret will be a failed career path or a\nlack of financial foresight however in\nactuality most people's biggest regrets\ntend to fall in a more emotional nature\nsuch as not being present with their\nfamily\nmany elderly find that it may be too\nlate to show their genuine feelings of\nlove and affection especially when the\nopportunity has already passed\nnumber four worrying too much about the\npast\ndo other people say that you're always\nstuck in the past\nyou might believe that getting older\nautomatically means moving on from\neverything in the past but it's not\nalways the case\nas long as you spend all your time\nworrying and ruminating over past\nmistakes and missed opportunities you'll\nalways find yourself stuck and unable to\nmove on\nhowever this does not mean that you stop\ntalking about the past altogether\naccording to the american psychological\nassociation reminiscing and\ncommunicating about positive events from\nthe past can actually improve an elderly\nperson's psychological well-being\nso while it's good to talk about the\ngood old days of your friends and family\nit's equally important to look at the\npresent and think of the future\nnumber five being untruthful far too\nlong\nbeing untruthful doesn't only mean lying\nto other people you may also lie to\nyourself as well\njustifying your thoughts and beliefs in\nsomething that at your core doesn't\nreflect your values or innermost state\nat all\nsimilarly you may suppress your own\nwants and needs for externally motivated\nreasons\nthis can go on for ages without even\nrealizing it and even if you do it may\nbe too late for you to make an impactful\ndifference\nnumber six\nnot taking care of your body\nare you in your 20s to 30s\nthis is usually the age where you feel\ninvincible at least physically however\nyour body will naturally slow down after\nthat time if it's not cared for\nsending your youth without keeping a\ngood diet doing exercise and having\nenough sleep can accelerate this aging\nprocess\nolder adults who don't sleep well for\ninstance are more likely to suffer from\nmental health issues like depression and\ndevelop problems with attention and\nmemory\nnumber seven\nnot exploring your career\nhave you ever thought about opening up a\nbusiness after school but shrugged it\naside for fleeting pleasures\nor perhaps your career path was so busy\nand while paying that you justified\nstaying even when it meant not spending\nany time with your family and friends or\nbeing able to explore the things you're\npassionate about\nnot exploring your career options\nwhether it's because of a high payout or\na lack of intrinsic self-worth may end\nup leaving you wondering what if when\nyou're older\nnumber eight not traveling\ndo you get to travel often\nmany of the elderly often regret not\ntraveling and seeing the world\nthey may have lacked the resources and\nthe opportunity when they were younger\nand lack the energy when they're older\napart from being able to see the world\ntraveling also has many benefits for\nyour mental health such as improving\nyour mental power helping you stay calm\nand widening your perspectives\nnumber nine\nworking too hard\nhow much time do you spend working\noverworking is one of the most universal\nregrets for people later in life\naccording to his book being the father i\nnever had highly influential people like\nbarack obama had expressed regret for\nnot being there for his little girls due\nto work\nthe common pattern these people share is\nthe lack of time they gave towards the\npeople they cared about like their\nfamily and friends\nand number 10\nnot living your true self\ndo you hide parts of yourself to fit in\nwith people\nif so you may find that the more\nsuccessful your attempt at masking\nyourself is\nmore lonely and isolated you end up\nfeeling\nchanging who you are and pretending to\nbe someone else to please other people\ncan be a source of regret late in life\nif you recognize this tendency in\nyourself you may want to reflect on why\nyou feel the need to do it and how you\ncan take the steps to start living your\ntrue self\ndo you have
