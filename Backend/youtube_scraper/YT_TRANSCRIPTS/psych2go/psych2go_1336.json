    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to another video.\nBefore we start, we would\nlike to thank you all\nfor the support that you've given us.\nAs you know, Psych2Go's mission\nis to make psychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that, so thank you.\nNow, back to the video.\nHow attractive do you think\nyou seem to other people?\nAre you insecure about\ncertain parts of yourself?\nEveryone has their own\ninsecurities about themselves\nand may fear how it may\ncome off for other people.\nBut you never know:\nthose very same qualities\nin yourself that you are insecure about\nare traits that some people\nmay actually appreciate\nand find attractive.\nWhile there's certainly\nsome truth in the saying,\n\"No one can know you better\nthan you know yourself,\"\nwhen it comes to attractiveness,\nsometimes we just can't tell\nbecause we're so hard on ourselves.\nTo help you with that,\nhere are eight flaws\nthat actually make you more attractive.\nNumber one, you are shy.\nDo you speak in a soft voice,\nbut prefer to keep quiet most of the time?\nAre you the type to duck your head\nor fidget when people look at you?\nWhile you may have a\nhard time believing this,\nthere are actually a\nlot of people out there\nwho find shyness an\nattractive trait to have.\nIn a world where sociable, talkative,\ntake-charge types of people\nare all clamoring to be\nthe center of attention,\nthere may be something refreshing\nabout being with someone\nwho likes to listen\nmore than they like to talk.\nAfter all, shy people are\noften seen as more mysterious,\nintriguing, and down-to-earth\ncompared to others.\nNumber two, you're clumsy.\nAnother trait that some\nfind surprisingly attractive\nis clumsiness.\nIn fact, psychology says\nthat men in particular\ntend to find clumsiness\nin women to be attractive,\nnot only because it makes\nthem seem more genuine,\nyouthful, and excitable,\nbut also because it\nmakes them feel needed.\nClumsiness also makes\npeople feel compelled\nto approach you and to help\nyou out when you're in a rut.\nNumber three, you're easily embarrassed.\nDo you often get flustered\nwhen people tease you\nor get embarrassed when your friends\npoke fun at you for something?\nDo you tend to blush, squeal,\nor cover your face when this happens?\nWhile this may seem like\na flaw to some people,\nbeing easily embarrassed\nis quite an attractive trait to others,\nespecially to men.\nSimilar to the previous point,\npeople who are easily\nembarrassed seem more genuine\nbecause they don't try to\nhide their true feelings.\nNumber four, you're nerdy.\nThose who get called nerds or geeks\noften get a bad reputation\nfor loving something deeply.\nBut what's so wrong with that?\nWhether it's comic books, anime,\nvideo games, Broadway musicals,\nor some other obscure interest\nnot a lot of people can relate to,\nbeing a nerd isn't something\nyou should be ashamed of.\nIn fact, there are some\nwho find nerds attractive\nfor the very same reasons\nthey're criticized for.\nThey're driven, excited,\nand most of all passionate\nabout the things they enjoy.\nNumber five, you're too honest.\nDo you always say what you mean?\nTo those who are tired of listening\nto everyone telling them\nwhat they want to hear,\nit can be nice to have someone\nwho always tells the truth no matter what.\nBeing honest can be a\nvery attractive trait\nbecause it means that you're\nnot going to waste their time\nby beating around the bush\nor by playing mind games with them.\nDespite how difficult it may be,\nyou are able to just come out\nand say what they need to hear.\nNumber six, you're an oversharer.\n\"Oh, I shouldn't have said that.\n\"Sorry, I've been talking\nand sharing so much.\"\nDoes this sound like you?\nWell, the good news is\none of the silver linings\nto being an oversharer\nis that it makes you seem\nmore sincere and approachable.\nWhile some may prefer a mystery,\nthere are those who like it\nwhen someone is an open book.\nThis may be because your openness creates\na comfortable environment for them\nto open up and to share things\nabout themselves they don't usually share.\nIt makes it easier for\nthem to develop closeness\nand intimacy in a relationship.\nNumber seven, you take things slow.\nDo you always take a long\ntime making decisions\nbecause you tend to overthink things\nand focus on all the details?\nDo you always have a lot\ngoing on in your mind?\nYou're probably a deep\nthinker and the type who likes\nto observe the situation\nbefore forming an opinion.\nUnlike those who are\nalways craving excitement\nor chasing one thrill after\nthe other in their lives,\nyou appreciate and savor the\npeace and quiet in your life\nand prefer to take your time with things,\nand to people who feel the same way,\nthis can be a very\nappealing quality to have.\nAnd number eight, you crave support.\nAs humans, it's normal to\ncrave affection from others.\nThough it's true that sometimes people\nwho openly desire warmth,\nsympathy, and encouragement\nfrom others can be a bit\noff-putting at times,\nespecially when they seem\ntoo needy or desperate,\nthere is something nice\nabout being with someone\nwho makes you feel needed.\nWhether it's kind words, sweet gestures,\nthoughtful gifts, or\nsimply time and attention,\nhaving a partner who\nwants and asks for support\ncan be a very attractive quality.\nDid you find any of these\nsurprising or insightful?\nLet us know in the
