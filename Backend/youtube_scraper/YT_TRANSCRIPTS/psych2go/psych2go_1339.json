    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nHow much do you know about sex?\nWhether you know a lot or not much,\nthere are quite a lot of\ninteresting things sex can do\nto our minds and bodies\nthat you might not know.\nWhat are these things you may ask?\nWell, here are six things sex\ndoes to your mind and body.\nNumber one.\nSex may help and create\nyour cognitive capacity.\nAccording to a study,\npublished in the Personality\nand Social Psychology Bulletin,\nsimply thinking about a sexual encounter\nmay enhance analytical thinking.\nThe study states that,\nit suggests that when in love,\n\"people typically focus on\na long-term perspective,\n\"which should enhance holistic thinking\n\"and thereby create thought,\n\"whereas when experiencing\nsexual encounters,\n\"they focus on the present\nand on concrete details,\n\"enhancing analytic thinking.\n\"Because people automatically activate\n\"these processing styles when in love\n\"or when they experience sex,\n\"subtle or even unconscious\nreminders of love\n\"versus sex should suffice\nto change processing modes.\"\nAnother 2010 study published\nin the PLOS One using rats\nfound that sexually active rodents\nhad more neurons in\nthe part of their brain\ncalled the hippocampus when\ncompared to virgin rats.\nThis part of the brain\nhas an important role\nin memory and learning.\nResearchers noticed that\nwhen sexual activity\nlater stopped among rodents,\nthey lost those\nadvancements in brain power.\nNumber two.\nSex may boost self-esteem.\nEveryone's different, but\naccording to psychologists,\nsex may aid in boosting your self-esteem.\nPsychologist, Ryan Anderson\nexplained in Psychology Today\nthat lack of sex can lead\ninto feelings of angst,\nself-doubt, and inadequacy.\nAnd there is strong evidence\nthat feelings of self-worth and identity\nare strongly associated with sex.\nHe goes on, explaining\nthat social pressure\nmay come into play with this.\nHe also notes that often,\n\"sex therapists and marriage counselors\n\"agree that couples that engage\nregular sex with each other\n\"have far greater self-esteem\nthan those who don't.\"\nEveryone's scenario is different.\nFor some, sex isn't a priority\nand might not affect their\nself-esteem as much as others,\nbut for others, sex can't\nhelp but make you feel good,\nboth in mind and body\nin more ways than one.\nNumber three.\nFrequent sex may help heart health.\nAccording to a study published\nin the Journal of Epidemiology\nand Community Health,\n\"Frequent sex may decrease a male's risk\n\"for a fatal heart attack.\"\nResults from the research study revealed\nthat males who had sex\ntwo times or more a week\nhad a lesser chance of\na fatal heart attack\nthan those who had sex not quite as much.\nThe study noted additional\nfindings on strokes\nand their connections to\nfrequent sex, stating,\n\"Middle aged men should be heartened\n\"to know that frequent sexual intercourse\n\"is not likely to result\n\"in a substantial increase\nin the risk of strokes,\n\"and that some protection\nfrom fatal coronary events\n\"may be an added bonus.\"\nNumber four.\nIt can alter your pain perception.\nSex can alter your pain perception?\nYep.\nAnd it's all thanks to a part of our brain\ncalled the hypothalamus.\nAccording to some research,\nsex may alter your pain perception,\nmaking you feel less pain.\nThe section of the brain\ncalled the hypothalamus\nreleases the feel good hormone, oxytocin,\nalso known as the love hormone\nduring orgasm or arousal.\nResearchers at Rutgers university\nfound that this release of oxytocin\nmay help women feel less pain.\nThis can be especially\ntrue during menstruation.\nAnother study published\nin the Bulletin of Experimental\nBiology and Medicine\nfound that extremely low doses of oxytocin\nreduce pain sensitivity in men,\nlowering one's pain threshold by 56.5%.\nNumber five.\nSex can take work for long term partners.\nThere's a popular belief\namong many young people\nthat sexual satisfaction\ncan diminish with time and\nlong term relationships,\nbut it actually just takes a bit of work.\nRecent research from the\nUniversity of Toronto\nrecognized that effort is required\nif you wanna have a great sex life\nwith your long term partner.\nSo don't expect it to\nbe wonderful every time\nif you don't put in some\nwork every now and then.\nA healthy relationship with\ncommunication and effort\ncan equal a healthy and happy sex life.\nAnd number six,\nsex before an important event\nmay lower your level of stress.\nLooks like sex may just help your grades\non your university final exams.\nA 2006 research study\npublished in the journal,\nBiological Psychology\nhad subjects take part\nin stressful activities.\nThese included giving a public speech\nor taking a difficult math quiz.\nSubjects who had sex before the test\nhad lower blood pressure\nand lower levels of stress.\nThis was then compared\nto those who had no sex,\nthose who masturbated,\nand those who had sexual\ncontact without intercourse.\nThe study even claims the\npenile-vaginal intercourse, PVI,\nbut not other sexual behavior\nis associated with better psychological\nand physiological function.\nYou may just have to\nthank not only yourself,\nbut your partner as well for\nthat A plus on your math exam.\nSo, which of these were you\nmost surprised to hear about?\nLet us know in the comments down below\nWe hope enjoyed this video\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like
