    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nDo you find it hard to socialize?\nWanna learn how to be more likable?\nYou're in the right place.\nResearch in the field of social\npsychology has helped widen\nour understanding of relationships\nand how people will act in\nsocial groups and situations.\nKnowing this, you can learn ways\nto boost your likability\nwhen around people.\nSo if you want to expand\nyour social circle,\nhere are seven ways to\nmake people like you more.\nNumber one, talk nicely\nabout other people.\nHave you ever met a person\nwho just couldn't stop\ngossiping about others?\nDid they come off likable and trustworthy?\nMost probably not.\nSpontaneous trait inference\nis a judgment you automatically make\nabout people's personalities\nbased on their behavior.\nSo when you hear someone describe\nothers in a negative way,\nyou may associate them\nwith those negative traits.\nOn the other hand, if\nthey talk about others\nin a positive way, you'll\nprobably like that person more.\nSo if you want someone to like\nyou, keep away from gossip.\nLook for qualities and\npositive traits in everyone.\nAnd if you talk about\nsomeone behind their back,\ngive them nothing but compliments.\nNumber two, be aware\nof your body language.\nDo you shake your leg\nor tap your fingers on the\ntable when you're anxious?\nEven if your voice stays quiet,\npeople can tell a lot\nabout you from your face\nand body language.\nFor example, looking someone\nin the eyes can let them know\nthat they have your full attention.\nHowever, staring at them for too long\ncan become threatening.\nSo remember to glance\naway every now and then.\nYou can also nod too\nwhen someone is talking to let them know\nthat you're actively listening to them.\nSimilarly, try not to keep\nyour arms and legs crossed\nas it may send a message\nthat you're being defensive,\nself-protective, or closed off.\nNumber three, be aware of\ntheir body language too.\nWhile it's good to be aware\nof your own body language,\nit's good to be conscious\nof theirs as well.\nResearchers from New\nYork University in 1999\npublished a paper describing a phenomenon\ncalled the chameleon effect,\nwhich is to mimic other\npeople's posture, mannerisms,\nfacial expressions, and other behaviors.\nBy matching your body language to theirs,\nit will increase the likelihood\nof them liking you more.\nAnd this goes the other way as well.\nIf you notice that a person\nis mirroring your movements,\nthen it may mean that\nthey like you already.\nOf course, be careful not to overdo it\nas it may end up looking creepy\nif you end up just copying\neverything they do.\nNumber four, try not to judge anyone.\nEver know someone who just\ncouldn't help themselves\nwhen it came to judging other people\nand their values and opinions?\nWhen you are in the company\nof someone who is judgy,\nyou may feel like you\ncan't share any opinion\nor be yourself around them\nsince you don't wanna\nstart a heated discussion.\nFor this reason, you should\ntry being nonjudgmental\nas much as you can.\nTry to recognize that\nevery opinion matters\nand that every choice people\nmake is driven by something\nbehind the curtain, something\nthat is important to them.\nIt may be hard if you're\npassionate about a certain topic,\nbut if you can create an image of yourself\nthat presents you as a\nnon-judgmental person,\nothers will feel safe\nand respected around you,\nwhich of course will mean\nthat they'll like you more.\nNumber five, ask them\nquestions about their lives.\nIn a 2012 study from Harvard University,\nresearchers found that\ntalking about yourself\nmakes your brain release\nthe same chemicals\nas it is releasing when you\ndo something pleasurable,\nlike eating a delicious meal,\nhaving sex, or receiving money.\nAs a matter of fact, in the same research,\nwhen they had a choice\nof answering questions\nabout themselves or receiving money,\nparticipants chose to\ntalk about themselves.\nThe results send a clear message.\nLet people talk about themselves.\nYou can ask questions about their career,\nschool, favorite band, family,\nor anything that you think\nmight be important to them.\nBy spurring on conversations about them,\nthey may come to associate\nthe happiness they experience\nduring those conversations with you.\nNumber six, spread\nhappiness and positivity.\nHave you ever spent time with someone\nwho was just a bubble of joy,\nalways smiling, laughing,\nspreading positivity?\nDid you notice those good\nfeelings catching onto you?\nPsychologists have a term for that,\nand it's called emotional contagion.\nThis means that emotional states\ncan be transferred to others,\nwhere they experience\nthe same emotions as you.\nIt goes for all emotions:\nfear, sadness, frustration,\njoy, and happiness,\neven though you can't just\nbe happy all the time.\nWhen you are feeling happy,\ntry to experience that\nhappiness to the fullest.\nLet the people around you feel it too.\nIf you share that joy,\nothers will catch on\nand they'll seek your company\nthe next time they see you.\nAnd number seven, let\nthem know you like them.\nWe emphasized how people\nlike being in the company\nof those who give them\npleasurable feelings,\nand there is one more effect\nthat can help you achieve\nthis: reciprocal liking.\nConfirmed by a large body of research,\nit shows that knowing someone likes you\nwill make you like that person too,\nwhether you tell them directly,\nwhether you're extra friendly to them\nor act warm in general.\nThe next time you fancy someone,\nyou should let them know.\nSo have you tried any of these?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this
