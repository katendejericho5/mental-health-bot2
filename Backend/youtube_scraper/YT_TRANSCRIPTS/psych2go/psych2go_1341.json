    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Amanda] What comes to your mind\nwhen you hear the word introvert?\nIs it that shy wallflower daydreaming\nin the social gathering,\nor the quiet kid who\nrarely spoke up in class?\nBut wait, did you know there is much more\nthat describes an introvert\nthan just their socializing\nfrequency or lack thereof.\nThere are even different\ntypes of introverts.\nWho knew, right?\nBy definition, introverts\nneed time by themselves\nto recharge and avoid\nbecoming emotionally drained.\nBut according to research\nby a psychology professor\nat Wellesley college,\nthere are four different\ntypes of introverts.\nThese types take into account\nthe varied personalities of introverts\nand acknowledge that\nintroversion is a spectrum.\nWith that being said,\nhere are the four types of introverts.\nOne, social introvert.\nSocial introvert?\nYeah, you heard that right,\nsocial introverts are\nboth the most outgoing\nand the most private of the four types.\nThey don't feel shy or\nanxious in social settings,\nit may even enjoy them, but\nthey feel emotionally drained\nif they stay out for too long.\nWhile social introverts\nlike spending time alone,\nthey still want a few close\nfriends they can depend on,\nand they tend to be the most social\nwhen they're among this group of friends.\nSomeone who doesn't know them\nmight even assume that\nthey're an extrovert\nif they meet them\nwhen they're hanging out\nwith their close friends,\nbut social introverts won't\nshare much about themselves\nto anyone other than\ntheir closest friends.\nTwo, thinking introvert.\nHere, you can conjure the image\nof the daydreaming wallflower.\nThinking introverts also\ndon't mind socializing,\nbut they rarely do so,\nbecause they're lost in\ntheir own little world.\nThey often find themselves daydreaming\nand may seem aloof to\nthose who don't know them.\nThinking introverts are\nalso very introspective,\nand therefore, more in\ntuned with their feelings\nthan the average person.\nOther people may have\na hard time connecting\nwith thinking introverts,\nbecause they have a unique thought process\nand prefer to experience their thoughts\nrather than taking the time and energy\nto explain them to others.\nThree, anxious introvert.\nDo you know of someone\nwho might replay social\nencounters in their head\nand think about what they said or did\nand what they could have done differently?\nPerhaps a better label for\nthe the anxious introvert\nis the shy introvert.\nTo differentiate anxious introversion\nfrom anxiety disorders,\nanxious introverts crave solitude,\neven when they're with\ntheir close friends.\nThey're extremely uncomfortable\nin new or large social situations\nand analyze or ruminate on their behavior\nwhenever they're in public.\nBut it's important to look out\nfor social anxiety disorders\nand not have the two mixed.\nIn extreme cases, this\naversion to social situations\nmay develop into social anxiety.\nAlthough, any personality type,\nintroverts, extroverts, or ambiverts,\ncan experience social anxiety\nor other anxiety disorders.\nBut if you avoid necessary\nsocial situations,\nbecause you have strong\nphysical reactions,\nsuch as shaking, increased heart rate,\nor nausea during them,\nit is a sign of social\nanxiety and not shyness\nand requires professional attention.\nAnd four, restrained introvert.\nNow, this is your introvert\nnext door kind of type.\nThey get uncomfortable if they\nfeel rushed into situations,\nespecially social ones.\nRestrained introverts\nare reserved, thoughtful,\nand don't like change.\nThey'll go out if they've planned for it\nfar enough in advance,\nbut they would rather be\nrelaxing by themselves,\nbinging on their favorite\nshows, reading, or doing yoga.\nRestrained introverts find\ncomfort in their routine,\nand may also find it difficult\nto get their mind and body\nmoving right after they wake up.\nThey thrive in their routine\nand appreciate ample forewarning.\nIf you think you're an introvert,\nbut didn't relate to\nany of these four types,\nyou may be an ambivert\nor closer to the extrovert side\nof the personality spectrum.\nLearning more about your personality type\nhelps you communicate your needs to people\nwith different personality types\nand strengthens\ninterpersonal relationships.\nDid you find this insightful?\nWill you now be able to tell\nthe different types apart?\nCan you think of any other types?\nIf you're an introvert,\nwhich of these four\ntypes did you relate to?\nShare this with an introvert you know\nto find out what type they are.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\nbe sure to hit like,\nand subscribe for more content.\nThanks for watching, and we'll\nsee you in the next video.\n(gentle music)"
