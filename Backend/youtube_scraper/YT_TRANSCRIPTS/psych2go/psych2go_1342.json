    "transcript": "- [Narrator] So you've been\nchatting with someone online\nwhen you start to get a feeling\nin the pit of your stomach.\nNo, it's not last night's\nburritos kicking in.\nIt's butterflies.\nWell, here are six signs\nsomeone online likes you.\nNumber one, they'll often use\nthe social media platform that you prefer.\nSo you have your social\nmedia platform of choice.\nYou're comfortable\nsending the good old gif\nor is it gif?\nAnd meme from there.\nAnd you think there's no way\nyou'd turn to another social media site.\nThat is until you get\na text from your crush,\nsaying that they're more\noften on another one.\nTime to install.\nThe thing is when people\noften have a crush\nthey'll wanna please them\nby doing what's comfortable for them.\nIf that means simply downloading\nanother app to text on.\nEasy peasy, lemon squeezy.\nSo pay attention to if that person\nyou've been chatting with online\nhas a newly activated\naccount on social media.\nDid you mention it was your app of choice?\nNumber two, they crack a few jokes\nin attempt to make you smile or laugh.\nSo you're texting this person\nand they suddenly send you a giraffe meme.\nYou don't know where they got this idea\nthat you love giraffes\nor that you're a meme\nfanatic, but you love it.\nYou'll ride a giraffe to your honeymoon.\nOh, okay.\nLet's, let's take it easy,\nbut it's nice to know that\nthey're trying to make you smile.\nIf you find they're cracking a few jokes,\nsharing silly photos of themselves\nor sending a few funny\ngifs, or gifs, or memes,\nthey're likely putting\nin that extra effort\nof finding the most hilarious thing\nbecause they're trying to\nget you to laugh or smile,\nbecause why wouldn't you want\nthe person you like to smile?\nThey respond fast.\nHow fast does your crush\nrespond to your texts?\nDo they leave you unread for hours?\nIf someone genuinely likes you,\nthey won't wanna leave you waiting\nif they're not busy.\nIf they have time to talk to\nyou and wanna talk to you,\nthey will respond\nquickly to your messages.\nMany people have busy\nlives or hectic schedules.\nSo don't take offense\nif they don't always respond right away.\nYour schedules may simply not match\nbut a good friend will\ngenerally let you know\nwhen they suddenly disappear\nfrom the online conversation,\nor if they've been busy\nin a short or lengthy response later.\nAnd if they really like you,\nthey'll make sure to keep\nthe conversation going\nwhen they're not busy,\nwhich brings me to my next point.\nNumber four, they continue\nwith the conversation\nand add to it.\nDoes your online crush add their thoughts\nto your conversations\nor do they only provide minimal responses?\nSometimes there's simply\nnot a lot to talk about\nand it can be a bit nerve wracking,\nthinking what topic to bring up next\nwhen you're anxious about liking someone.\nBut a good friend will generally try\nto keep the conversation going\nif they're not too busy.\nThis could mean bringing\nup things about their day.\nInteresting comments on\na show they're watching\nor even sending those funny giraffe memes\nwe talked about.\nThey'll simply make an\nexcuse to talk to you.\nAnd once you start talking,\nthey'll generally put in a bit of effort\ninto keeping the conversation going.\nThat is if you put some effort in too.\nIf you don't,\nthey may be wondering if you like them\nas much as they like you.\nSimply put, if you're having a fun time\ntalking to them casually let them know.\nRomance is soon to follow\nif you both like each\nother and express it.\nNumber five.\nThey show interest in what you text.\nSo you just sent a long three paragraph\nexplanation on the meaning of life.\nIgnore what context.\nAnd you eagerly wait for their reply.\nTyping, typing, typing, k.\nThey respond with k.\nBruh.\nIf who you're texting shows\nminimal responsiveness\nand generally no interest in\nyour opinions or thoughts,\nthey probably aren't feeling it.\nIf someone likes you,\nthey'll generally wanna\nknow how you're doing.\nA quick, how are you today,\nor a follow up question\nto what you discussed yesterday\nare all good signs.\nAnd if you express your opinion\non a personal topic or even a random one,\nthey generally give you\nsome sort of excitement\nor thoughtful response if they like you.\nIf they show interest\nin what you have to say\nand you display interest in\nwhat they're sharing with you,\nit sounds like it's time to let them know\nyou'd like to explore a more\nromantic relationship with them.\nAnd number six.\nThey often initiate the conversation.\nDoes your crush text you often?\nDo you both check in\non each other each week\nor even day-to-day?\nSomeone who's interested in you\nactually text back\nand they'll often\ninitiate the conversation\njust as much as you do, if not more.\nRemember the whole how are you\ncheck up text we mentioned?\nPeople often text that\nor something similar\nwhen they like someone.\nYou should too.\nBut if they also strike up a conversation\non an interesting topic frequently,\nthey're likely into either being friends\nor a romantic partners.\nI think we're hoping for\nthe latter in this case.\nMaybe you both have similar\ninterests or hobbies.\nIf so, they will likely\nwanna text you about them\nand start up a conversation\nabout these topics.\nMore importantly, if you\ntext them often as well,\nthey make sure you\ndon't fall out of touch.\nEvery healthy relationship\nrequires good communication.\nSo pay attention to if they actually\ncommunicate with you.\nAnd when in doubt, try simply asking them.\nSo you're both on the same page\nor send a giraffe meme.\nYou know what?\nThe asking is probably\nbetter for the context."
