    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nSo you're looking for the one, are you?\nOr perhaps you're thinking\nyou've already found them.\nHow do you know?\nWell, there are some things\nthat can change in our lives\nwhen we're truly in love\nwith someone romantically.\nOur thoughts, actions and\nbrain's chemical reactions\ncan all change with love,\nespecially when we've found the one.\nSo here are a few things\nthat may happen when you've found the one.\nNumber one, your brain\nchanges when you love them.\nDo you get an unexplainable euphoric surge\nof happiness when you think of someone?\nThis particular someone who\nyou think might be the one.\nWonder why.\nA 2007 study from researchers\nat Stony Brook University\nfound that your biochemical reactions\nin your brain can change\nin a particular way\nwhen you're thinking of\nsomeone you truly love.\nYour happiness is likely explained\nby the boost in dopamine.\nAnd your reward system\nis getting all this great attention too.\nSo try thinking of the one.\nAs in the one you may be\nthinking could be the one.\nJust think of someone.\nFeeling euphoric, happy,\noverindulging in these thoughts?\nThis could be a sign of real attachment.\nOr you could just have an\nextremely strong crush.\nAsk them out or take it easy, my friend.\nNumber two, you can't wait for your family\nto meet them.\nDo you imagine your family\nand friends meeting them?\nDo you get excited by the thought of it?\nIf you're really serious about someone,\nthen you'll likely want the ones\nyou already love in your life\nto meet your partner, even\nif you're not partners yet.\nYou might wanna bring\nalong your family member\nor friends to an event to\ncatch a glimpse of this person.\nCasual relationships don't often involve\na formal introduction to family members,\nso if both of you have expressed interest\nin meeting each other's family,\nthis is a good sign your relationship\nis not only getting serious\nbut if they have even more of these signs,\nthey could just be the one.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo if you haven't\nand at the end of the video,\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three, you feel in sync\nand harmonious with them.\nDo you feel in sync with your partner?\nSimply harmonious and connected?\nLife coach, Olga Levancuka,\nexplained in an article from FashionBeans\nthat scientists have\nfound that some couples\nare so in tune that their brains begin\nto work in sync.\nThat means they've reached a state\nin which their nervous systems\nare ticking over in harmony,\nhelping them to read each\nother's thoughts and emotions.\nAsk yourself, do my partner\nand I simply get each other?\nAre we more spiritually\nand emotionally connected\nthan our past relationships?\nThis could be because they're the one.\nNumber four, you're comfortable\nand don't wanna control your feelings\nor words with them.\nSomething else that happens\nwhen you found the one,\nafter you've known them for a while,\nyou lower your defenses\nand are simply comfortable with them.\nYou don't alter your words,\nworrying about what to say or do.\nYou're simply you.\nUnapologetically and with ease.\nIf they're the same,\neven more of a good sign.\nNumber five, you find\ntheir unfunny jokes funny.\nHas this person you're\nthinking of ever told\nan extremely unfunny joke\nbut you laughed like a drunk\nhyena at a comedy club?\nThen you may have just found the one.\nOr you really, really like them\nbecause how funny could a joke\nabout a chicken crossing the road be?\nIt's a classic yeah, but you get my point.\nKeep noticing later\nthat you're the only one\nlaughing at their jokes\nwhile they simply smile on?\nYeah, they may just be\nyour special someone.\nAnd number six,.\nIt's no longer just I.\nYour life plans and\ndreams include them too.\nHave you gone from\nsaying I to we more often\nwhen talking about your future?\nSocial psychologist Theresa E. DiDonato\nexplains in her article\nfrom Psychology Today\nthat people who are close use plural words\nlike we more frequently\nin conversation than singular\npronouns like I or me.\nThe kinds of feelings that suggest love\nare likely accompanied by a tendency\nto use plural pronouns.\nSo you notice you've been\nusing plural words more often,\nespecially when talking about\ninterests, dreams, goals.\nHas your life plan also changed\nbecause of this person?\nDo your dreams for the\nfuture include them?\nThis is yet another thing\nthat is likely to happen\nwhen you've found your one and only.\nHave you found the one for you yet?\nDo you think you've met the one recently?\nOr maybe you think it's your partner.\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\n(tranquil music)"
