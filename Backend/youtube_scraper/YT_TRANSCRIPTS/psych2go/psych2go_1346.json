    "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Today,\nwe are going to explore\nthe mysteries of love.\nSo, let's start with our big question.\nHow do you know when someone likes you?\nIt's rarely about the things they say.\nMore often than not, it's about\nthe things they don't say.\nWords can be misleading.\nThey may never admit\ntheir feelings out loud\nbut their actions may tell\nyou a different story.\nLove communicates through\nsubtle, subconscious behaviors:\nyour small gestures, stolen\nglances, and moments of silence.\nIt's a challenging language to understand\nbut if you pay close attention,\nyou can unravel someone's true feelings.\nTo help you decipher the language of love,\nhere are 10 signs that\nyour crush likes you.\nJust as a disclaimer,\njust one of the signs may mean nothing\nbut the more of these signs,\nthe more likely your crush\nreally does like you.\nOne: they fixate on you.\nThe eyes are often called\nthe windows to the soul\nbut is that really true?\nCan you understand your crush's feelings\njust by watching their eyes?\nIn a 2014 study, Walmont and others\nfound that your eyes give\naway your honest intentions.\nYou unconsciously fixate on people,\nplaces, and objects\nthat you want the most.\nIf you're staring at food,\nyou're probably hungry.\nIf you're staring at old\nphotos, you might be homesick.\nIf your crush is fixated on\nyou, they may be in love.\nTwo: they lean toward you.\nLove changes the orientation of your body.\nAround friends, you lean back.\nYou're calm and comfortable.\nAround someone you like,\nyour body springs forward.\nYou lean towards your crush\nto show them you care.\nImagine your crush is talking about\na sport you've never played.\nIt's not your favorite\nsubject to talk about\nbut you lean forward anyway.\nWhy?\nBecause their opinions matter to you.\nWithout realizing it,\nyour body changes shape.\nSo, does your crush's\nbody lean towards you?\nA little movement can go a long way.\nThree: they're vulnerable with you.\nIt's not easy to be open with someone.\nIn your daily life, you raise giant walls\nto protect yourself from getting hurt\nbut when you're around someone you trust,\nthose walls come crumbling down.\nAccording to a 1997\nstudy by Erin and others,\nvulnerability nurtures\nboth love and attraction.\nIt builds trust by fostering\ndeeper feelings of closeness\nbut vulnerability isn't just\nabout expressing yourself.\nIt needs to be mutual.\nIf your crush always wants\nto know more about you,\nyou two may be more than just friends.\nFour: they smile at you.\nDifferent smiles mean different things.\nSome are closed and mysterious;\nothers are open and happy.\nBut how do people smile\nwhen they're in love?\nA 2018 research summary\nby Montoya and others\nexplains that a genuine\nsmile can demonstrate trust,\nattraction, and vulnerability.\nIn other words, your crush\nmay be constantly smiling\nbecause they feel close to you.\nFive: they open their posture.\nWhen you interact with someone you like,\nyou instinctively open your posture.\nYour arms fall away from your chest,\nyour legs uncross, your back straightens.\nEach of these non-verbal signals\ncreates a physical and\nemotional bond with someone.\nSo, if your crush likes you,\ntheir posture may open up the\nmoment you enter the room.\nSix: they look into your eyes.\nWhen you spend time with your crush,\nyour brain releases a love\nhormone called oxytocin.\nThis hormone circulates through your brain\nand makes you feel closer\nto the people around you.\nThat closeness changes your body language,\nencouraging things like eye contact.\nIn other words, looking\ninto your crush's eyes\nisn't just romantic.\nIt's a great way to express your interest.\nIf they return the favor,\nthe feelings may be mutual.\nSeven: they make physical contact.\nIf you like someone, tiny\nthings can be electrifying.\nA small touch on the arm,\ntheir legs rubbing gently against yours.\nContact is so powerful because\ntouching another person,\nespecially someone you like,\ntriggers the same flood\nof feel-good hormones.\nRemember this each time your crush\nbrushes your hand or touches your back.\nIt's not always an accident.\nYour crush may be trying to\nshow their true feelings.\nEight: they make time for you.\nDoes your crash make time for you?\nBy opening up their schedule,\nthey're tearing down an important barrier.\nSomething that would stop\nyou two from being together.\nInvisible forces like time and distance\nare common roadblocks for young couples.\nEach time your crush makes time for you,\nthey're leaping over one of these hurdles.\nAccording to a 2010 study\nfrom Rhodes and others,\nthat means your relationship\nmay have more potential.\nNine: they copy your behavior.\nHave you ever noticed\nyour crush copying you?\nEvery time you smile, they smile.\nEvery time you take a drink, they do too.\nThis psychological phenomenon\nis called mirroring.\nWhen you like someone,\nyou mimic their posture,\nactions, and facial expressions.\nSo, if talking to your crush\nis like looking into a mirror,\nthere's a good chance they\nhave feelings for you.\nAnd 10: they invest in you.\nHas your crush ever lent\nyou a jacket or a pencil?\nOn the surface, these little\nfavors don't look like much\nbut they're often a sign\nof romantic interest.\nWhen you lend something to your crush,\nyou're making a small investment.\nThat item, no matter how small,\nbinds the two of you together,\nso don't let your crush's\ninvestment go unnoticed.\nHas your crush been\nsending you hidden signals?\nHave you noticed signs we\ndidn't cover in this video?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nShare this video with someone\nwho might
