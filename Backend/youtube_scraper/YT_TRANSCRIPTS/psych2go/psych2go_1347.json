    "transcript": "- [Mithrilda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nIf you're new here, welcome.\nHave you ever wondered\nif your crush was attracted to you?\nSometimes people's behavior can give away\nhow they really feel about you.\nSo with that in mind,\nhere are six signs\nthat somebody might\nbe secretly attracted to you.\nNumber one, they gaze at\nyou and make eye contact.\nHave you ever noticed when somebody\nis holding their gaze on you?\nEye contact is a powerful gesture\nand studies have shown\nthat you are more drawn to someone\nbased on their gaze's direction and smile.\nThis may be why you might find someone\ntrying to hold your gaze\nsince it's an attempt\nto form a lasting impression\nand a deeper connection with you.\nExperts from the University of Sterling\nand the University of Wolverhampton\nhave even cited in a study\nthat making eye contact\ncan help people remember you better\nlong after you've talked to them.\n- [Amanda] Do you struggle\nto build deeper connections with others?\nAre you looking for ways\nto connect with people\nbeyond the surface level?\nToday's video is sponsored by So Syncd.\nA place that can match partner's\npersonality types based on\na 16 personalities model.\nYou can access it by clicking\nthe link below.\n- [Mithrilda] Number two,\nthey will mirror or mimic you.\nHave you ever noticed\nsomeone copying your movements\nwhen you're talking to them?\nYou could be sitting with your legs closed\nor playing with your hair\nand they'll mirror those\nmovements the same.\nThis is called the mirror neuron system.\nIt can happen consciously\nand unconsciously,\nbut it's a way for people\nto show that they understand\nand share how you feel.\nIt can help produce a positive feeling\nfor the other person\nand help further establish\nthe bond between you.\nAnd it's not limited\nto just body movements.\nFor example, if you have a preference\nfor a certain color of clothing,\nthey may show up wearing\nsomething in that color as well.\nNumber three, they might\ninitiate physical contact.\nAccording to behavior\nanalyst, Jack Schafer,\nwomen may lightly touch the arm\nof someone they're talking to\nto indicate that they like them.\nIt's important here\nto know that this light touch\nis not an invitation\nto a sexual encounter,\nbut a way to show that she\nmay be secretly attracted to you.\nFor men, they may act more playful\nand put their arm around your shoulder.\nJust remember, everyone\nresponds to touch differently.\nSo if they pull away from you,\nthen they may be feeling uncomfortable\nand you should probably take it\nas a sign to avoid initiating\nany further physical contact\nunless prompted to.\nNumber four, they might change\ntheir body presentation.\nDo you notice them posing strangely?\nPeople alter their body language\ndepending on who they are around.\nAnd they may not even\nknow they are doing it.\nBoth men and women\nalter their body language\nby standing taller,\npulling their shoulders back,\nand sucking in their stomachs.\nA study found that having\nan open or expansive posture\ncan make you more attractive\nsince it hints at dominance.\nThat's why people who\nstand or sit in that way\nappear more attractive.\nSo the next time you see\nthem strutting their stuff,\nit is possible that\nthey are trying to impress you.\nEven if they don't consciously\nknow it themselves.\n- [Amanda] We talked about the importance\nof your potential partner being attentive\nand remembering the little things,\nwhich is why So Syncd\ncould be the right app for you.\nThey pair couples who have\nthe right amount of similarities\nto get each other,\nand just the right amount of differences\nto create that spark\nand go for deeper, meaningful dating.\nUpon taking the personality test,\nyou discover your personality,\nsuch as INFJ, so thoughtful,\nor ENFP, so curious.\nOnce you've mutually liked each other,\nyou can start messaging.\nWe wanted to say a massive congratulations\nto Hannah and Brendan\nwho got married in December\nafter meeting on So Syncd,\nthe dating app that matches\ncompatible personality types.\nHannah is a Psych2Goer\nor who discovered So Syncd\nthrough one of our videos.\nShe downloaded the app,\nfound Brendan and deleted the app\nwithin a matter of hours.\nHannah is an ENFP and Brendan is an INTJ.\nThey would be a perfect\npersonality match on So Syncd.\nDownload the app for free today\nto meet that special someone\non your wavelength.\nMake sure to check out the app\nin the description box below\nfor more details.\nWe encourage you to try it\nand give yourself a chance\nto find deeper love.\n- [Mithrilda] Number five,\nthey get flustered or jealous\nwhen you talk about another\npotential love interest.\nHave you ever noticed your crush\nor one of your close friends\nacting weird, flustered or angry\nwhen you're talking with someone else?\nAccording to Bustle,\njealousy can be a sign of attraction.\nIn reaction to seeing you\ntalking to someone else,\nthey may become upset\nor question you\nabout this other person\nto see how you feel about them.\nIn this case,\nthey may act in the moment\nand ask you out or do the opposite\nif they think they no longer\nhave a chance to be with you.\nUltimately, if you want clarity,\nthe most effective way\nis to talk to them\nand see how they feel about you.\nNumber six, they want to\nspend more time with you.\nDo they like to make plans with you?\nOne of the biggest signs\nthat someone finds you attractive\nis when they try to be with you\nas much as possible.\nTake a moment and consider\nhow much time they want\nto spend with you.\nHow much they text you\nor initiate contact with you.\nIf you notice that\nthis is happening more often,\nthen there may be a strong connection\nbetween you both.\nAt this moment,\nyou should ask yourself\nif you feel the same way about them.\nOtherwise, you may be potentially\nleading them on without\nbeing fully aware of it.\nHave you noticed any of these signs\nin the people you know?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video
