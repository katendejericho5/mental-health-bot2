    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Pscyh2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nAre you an introvert?\nExtrovert?\nAre you an introvert who's curious\nabout what qualities\nmight be more compatible\nwith your introverted self?\nOr maybe you're an extrovert\nwho has an introverted partner?\nWhat might they need from\nyou in a relationship?\nWell, here are six things\nintroverts need in a partner.\nNumber one, someone who is\ncomfortable with silence.\nSweet silence.\nIs there anything quite like it?\nTo some extroverts, silence\ncan be intimidating or awkward,\nbut introverts don't always\nwanna spend their time talking.\nSometimes just being in the\nsame room as their partner\nmakes them feel happy and connected.\nSo while you may be having\na cozy dinner together,\ndon't worry if there's a long pause\nwhile eating your delightful cuisine.\nThey might just not feel\nlike talking at the moment,\nbut value spending time with you.\nOr the food's just really good.\nLess talk, more eating.\nNumber two, a good listener.\nAre you a good listener?\nWho doesn't love someone\nwho can be there for them\nwhen they need to vent or\nare having a tough day?\nSome active listening and\nreassurance can go a long way,\nespecially for introverts.\nWhy do introverts value great listeners?\nWell, since they don't often open up\nto strangers or acquaintances,\nthey spend most of their time\ntalking with their closest\nfriends and loved ones,\nespecially their partners.\nIntroverts can spend a great\ndeal of time in their head,\ncoming up with interesting\nideas and theories.\nWho are they going to\ntell these theories to?\nIf they tell anyone,\nit's likely that it's\ngoing to be a loved one\nor their partner, which\nis where you come in.\nBoth of you can listen\nand share your thoughts with each other.\nAnd if there's a bit of\nsilence afterward, no problem.\nNumber three, someone\nwho values quality time.\nDo you enjoy quality time?\nIntroverts may just wanna spend\nsome of their days with\nyou doing simple things,\nand really getting to\nknow you in the process.\nPerhaps you'll both go on a walk together,\nor have a calm day of shopping\nand browsing the markets.\nA simple evening hanging\nout with your family\nand good old uncle Joe.\nPerhaps you'll spend your mornings\nhaving tea and baking biscuits.\nGood combo.\nWhatever it is you do,\nthe simple quality time together\ncan be just as good as the\nexciting and busy days out.\nNumber four, someone who\nunderstands personal space\nand alone time.\nDo you enjoy your alone time?\nAs much as you may love your partner,\nsometimes you just gotta be alone.\nIntroverts often need\ntime alone to recharge.\nTheir energy can sometimes\nget drained quickly\nwhen socializing with others,\nor spending more time in crowded groups.\nSo in return, perhaps at\nthe end of a long day,\nthey just need some time\nto unwind and relax.\nIf you notice they wanna\nspend some time alone\nin their room one day and are wondering\nif you did something wrong,\nask yourself this first.\nDid you recently do something\nthat may have upset them,\nor are they just being an introvert?\nWho doesn't love some peaceful time alone?\nAh, recharging.\nNumber five, a love\nfor deep conversations.\nWho needs small talk?\nTo an introvert, small\ntalk can be a great bore.\nIt's not great, but it is greatly boring.\nIt may make them simply feel a bit awkward\nhaving to force a bit of small talk\nwhen someone initiates the dreaded,\ncan you believe this weather?\nInstead, they value the\ndeeper conversations\nthey have with their partner.\nTalk about your ideas, your goals,\nwhat you enjoyed about that\nfilm, that book, that trip.\nDon't be afraid to hold back\nthe inner thoughts of your mind\nthat keep you restless in\nthe wee hours of the night.\nLet them out.\nYou may find you both have\nsomething else in common.\nSo if you're not often looking\nto talk about deeper things\nthan the weather, then, well,\nyou may have a stormy relationship ahead.\n(narrator chuckles)\nSee what I did there?\nNo?\nOh.\nAnd number six, someone who\ncan take things slow at first.\nWhen you start a relationship,\ndo you wanna take things slow?\nSome relationships move fast.\nOne minute you're exchanging numbers,\nthe next you're moving in together\nand introducing them to\nyour old uncle named Joe.\nWhy is Joe always around?\nIntroverts may simply need\nmore time to open up to others.\nThey wanna feel comfortable\nin your presence\nbefore opening up about\nwhat truly makes them them.\nSo go on a few casual fun\ndates, hang out together,\nget to know each other.\nAnd in due time, you may\njust be moving in together\nand meeting good old uncle Joe.\nSo do you have a crush on an introvert?\nAre you an introvert?\nWhat is it that you look for in a partner?\nLet us know in the comments.\nWe wanna hear from you.\nJust not about the weather.\nYeah, we get it.\nIt's raining.\nAlthough, I do love the rain.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with an\nintrovert or extrovert.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go
