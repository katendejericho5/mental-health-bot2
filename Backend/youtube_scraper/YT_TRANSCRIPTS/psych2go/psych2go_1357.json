    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you remember more of being scolded\nor being praised as a child?\nWhich one stuck with you the longest?\nWe often have the tendency\nto repeat negative\nand bad memories more often\nthan the positive ones.\nThese words carry weight\nsince there's a greater\ncellular activity in the brain\nwhen negative memories are formed.\nBecause of this, it's\nimportant to be careful\nwith the way you speak to your children\nas it can stick with them\nfor a really long time.\nTo learn more about\nthis here are six things\nparents should never say to a child.\nNumber one. You can't do anything right.\nWere you ever told this when\nyou did something wrong?\nPatience is a trait not\neveryone naturally possesses,\nbut it's important for parents to cut down\non these types of remarks\nwhenever your child isn't\nperforming up to caliber.\nIt serves no purpose other\nthan to belittle them,\nwhich can discourage and\ndo more harm than good\nto their growth.\nThis phrase can also lead them to set\nunrealistically high\nexpectations for themselves\nthat can lead to feelings of inadequacy\nand resentment later in life.\nNumber two. I'm disappointed in you.\nThis may be something you\noften say to your child\nwhen they've failed to meet\nyour expectation or standard,\nbut it can actually be\nquite damaging and harmful\nfor them to hear it, especially\nfor younger children.\nAccording to Dr. Lim Boon Leng\nfrom Psychological Wellness in Singapore,\nyour children are more susceptible\nto their parents' moods than older ones.\nThus, it's important to tone\ndown your statements like this,\nsince it can end up bruising\nyour child's self esteem and confidence.\nNumber three. You should be\nlike your brother or sister.\nWere you ever compared\nto your siblings before?\nIt's crucial to recognize\nthat children are individuals\nwith their own personalities and traits\nthat make them unique.\nInstead of telling your\nkid that they should be\nmore like their sibling or classmate\nwho make excel at a certain\nfield or subject like sports,\npraise them for their strengths\nand the things that they're good at\nlike literature or the arts instead.\nThere's no one perfect role model\nand needlessly comparing\nyour child to someone else's\nor their sibling can make\nthem feel inadequate.\nNumber four. It's your fault\nthat something bad happened.\nIt's normal for every\nparent to feel upset,\nangry, and frustrated at times\nat the things that their children do.\nHowever, it's very important to be careful\nwith the words you use when\nyou're feeling that way.\nChildren, especially the younger ones,\nare not able to differentiate your anger\nas an expression of frustration\nfrom an attack on them\nand therefore their sense of self-worth.\nFor example, if an\nemotionally taxing event\nlike the death of a pet occurs\nbecause of your child's negligence\nthey can be a burden for everyone,\nbut in moments like these\nit's crucial to take the time\nto be compassionate and to educate them\non how to deal with their sadness\nrather than assigning blame.\nThis will help them understand\nhow to navigate emotional turmoil,\nwhich is something they can carry\nfor the rest of their lives.\nNumber five. Don't cry.\nDo your parents get uncomfortable\nwith emotional outbursts\nand tell you to stop?\nTelling a child not to cry can teach them\nto conceal their emotions.\nThis can make it more\nlikely for them to develop\nmental health issues in\nboth the short and term.\nSimilarly, phrases like don't be sad\nor calm down should be avoided.\nResearch published in\nWashington State University\nshows that being able\nto openly acknowledge\nhow you're feeling no\nmatter how negative it is\ncan help improve mental health\nfor both parents and children.\nAnd number six.\nYou're the best at everything\nyou do, remember that.\nWhile warranted praise is healthy,\ngiving undue credit can\nactually be bad for them.\nSome children who are\npraised too frequently\ncan develop a sense of entitlement\nand become overconfident\nin their abilities.\nAt the same time, others\nwho are praised a lot\ncan end up feeling immense\npressure from the expectations\nthat their parents set on them.\nThis may cause them to fail to act\nor become unwilling to try new things.\nThe best approach is to give\nspecific and honest feedback.\nFor example, instead of saying your child\nis the best at soccer,\nbe specific about their positive traits\nlike how they're an excellent leader\nwho motivates their\nteammates during games.\nDid you relate to any of the signs above?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and studies\nused in this video,\nas always, are added in\nthe description below.\nThanks for watching and\nsee you in our next video."
