    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another brand new video.\nDo you feel lost in life?\nAre you tired of the same old 9-5,\nonly for it to happen\nagain the following week?\nSometimes life can feel like a blur,\nit might seem like a visual\ndepiction of the quote,\neat, work, repeat.\nYou wake up early,\ngo to school or work,\nrest, and the cycle continues\nday in and day out.\nIf you are looking to take back\nsome control over your life,\nhere are six small habits that\ncan change your life forever.\nNumber one: a gratefulness list.\nDo you feel like you forget things easily?\nAnd that moment you try to remember them,\nit just escapes your memory?\nIt's hard for your memory\nto store every moment\nof your waking life,\ntime can lead you to forget\nabout some of the things\nthat you had once cared about.\nMaybe a stranger complimented\nyour hair once, a week ago,\nor your teacher commended you\nfor submitting a great project.\nWeeks later, these things\nall fall into the recesses\nof your brain and are\nforgotten completely.\nA psychologist from the\nuniversity of California\ndid some research\nand it showed that people who write\nabout things they're grateful\nfor are more optimistic\nand feel better about their lives.\nIt can even lead you to take action more,\nlike exercising,\nwhich further improves\nmental health and wellbeing.\nNumber two: a social media detox.\nAre you aware of how much\ntime you've been spending\non social media platforms lately?\nIs it day after day of scrolling?\nIn the face of the pandemic,\nmore people than ever looked\nto their phone screens\nand social media for their social fix,\nbut alongside it, many\nnegative aspects have arisen,\nsuch as feelings of inadequacy, FOMO,\nfeelings of isolation and self-absorption.\nA 2018 UPenn study found\nthat reducing social media\nto 30 minutes a day\ncan significantly reduce\nfeelings of anxiety,\ndepression, and sleep problems.\nIt doesn't mean you have to\ncut back on it all at once,\nbut even just a slight time reduction\ncan already bring great benefits.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed,\nso if you haven't\nand at the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing,\nit would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three: clean your room daily.\nHave you tidied up your room recently?\nDoes your workspace look neatly organized\nor are things sprawled all over?\nWorking in a clean room can\ngive both your mind and body\na whole host of benefits.\nThese benefits include\nimproved sleep quality,\nincreased productivity, and\na sense of accomplishment.\nIf your room is messier\nthan you would like,\nit's advisable to try\nand divide your process\ninto more manageable chunks\nto make it feel less daunting.\nA little bit of effort can go a long way,\nthrow in some good music\nand you're all set for the adventure.\nNumber four: the 80/20 principle.\nEver heard of the 80/20 principle?\nVilfredo Pareto first\nintroduced the 80/20 principle,\nwhich laid out the idea\nthat 20% of homeowners\nown 80% of the land,\nthese same principles\napply to your daily life.\nOnly 20% of the work that you do\ncontributes to 80% of your success.\nThis means a big chunk of what you do\nis not relevant to our success.\nTo identify the 20%,\nyou could start with a list\nof everything you'd like to accomplish\nwith the most important tasks at the top.\nIt helps you recognize the top\n20% and focus on those tasks.\nWith that, you can improve your efficiency\nand push your efforts\nin things that truly matter most to you.\nNumber five: meditate.\nDid you know that meditation\ndates back thousands of years?\nDo you ever wonder if it\nactually improves anything?\nTo answer the question,\nmeditation or spending a few\nminutes practicing mindfulness\nhas been proven to help.\nIts primary purpose is to\ngive you a sense of calm\nand restore your inner peace.\nIt doesn't require anything more\nbut you and a nice quiet environment.\nMeditating brings down your stress levels,\ngiving you some space to\nbe alone with yourself\nand your thoughts.\nMeditation is also the\nultimate detoxifier.\nIt can increase your self-awareness,\nhelp you focus on the present\nand reduce negative emotions.\nNot only that, but there are\nmultiple ways to meditate too,\nsuch as Tai Chi or yoga, take your pick.\nAnd number six: exercise.\nAre you a treadmill person?\nOr run around your local park person?\nNo matter what the mode is,\nit's the intent that matters.\nWhen you exercise you're not\njust working your muscles\nand other physical aspects of your body,\nyou're improving your mental state too.\nExercising releases endorphins,\nwhich are feel good chemicals\nthat can boost your\nenergy throughout the day.\nBy building up the habit of exercise,\nyou can boost both your\nphysical and mental wellbeing,\nwhich in turn increases your confidence,\noptimism and decreases your stress levels.\nHabits are not one-time escapes,\nthey're consistent, ruminary acts\nthat can be fostered\nwith the right mindset\nand determination.\nStriving to cut down bad habits\nand building up good ones,\neven if you feel like\nyour progression is slow,\nit's a great step in the right direction.\nIt will come out all for the better.\nDo you think these habits are achievable?\nWhat are some habits you'd\nlike to break out of?\nFeel free to leave comments\ndown below with your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to
