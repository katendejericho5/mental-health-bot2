may be doing?\nIt's a truth universally acknowledged\nthat having good and healthy relationships\ncan make you a relatively happier person\nwhen compared to others.\nAn environment where you're\nconstantly getting ignored\ncan have a negative effect\non how you think of yourself and others.\nThis is especially true\nif you're not aware of why they do so.\nDo you think there may be\nsome habits you might have\nthat cause people to ignore you?\nBefore we begin, please\nnote this video is intended\nto help you gain awareness about this,\naddressing possible reasons\nwhy people are ignoring you.\nIt's important to keep in\nmind that this is not aimed\nto put any individual in a bad light.\nHaving said that, here are five habits\nthat might have been causing\npeople to ignore you.\nNumber one, you don't listen to others.\nDo you feel like you\ntend to speak a lot more\nthan other people do,\nor that you only talk about yourself?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthis might be a reason people ignore you.\nConstantly talking about yourself\nwithout letting other people get a word in\ncan annoy a lot of people.\nIt shows that you're not concerned\nabout the other person's point of view.\nRelationships thrive on a\ngive-and-take principle.\nIf you want to be\nlistened to when you talk,\nyou have to listen to others, as well.\nOf course, the reason you talk a lot\ndoes not necessarily mean\nthat you're not interested in others.\nMaybe you have a lot to share,\nor you think that having other people\nleading the conversation\ncould be a hassle for them.\nBut people actually love\nto talk about themselves.\nAnd you taking over the conversation\nmay give off the wrong impression.\nNumber two, you criticize too much.\nAre you someone who wants\nthe best for their close ones\nand always tells them what\nmistakes they've made?\nIf this is you,\nyou have a truly admirable\nand caring mentality.\nHowever, a lot of times,\nhaving this mentality\ncan lead you to criticize people too much,\nespecially if you only\nfocus on their mistakes.\nThe impression of being someone\nwho only knows how to criticize\nwill eventually lead to you\ngetting ignored by everyone,\neven if you have the best intentions.\nThis is not to say that you\nshould let your loved ones\nmake mistakes without saying anything.\nMeasured criticism is\nimportant for personal growth.\nHowever, throwing encouragement\nand compliments into the mix\ncan help mediate the\nseverity of the critique.\nNumber three, you're full of negativity.\nIs the glass always half empty for you?\nHave you ever felt like avoiding someone\nwho usually only says negative things?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthen you know how people\nreact to negativity.\nWhen you are constantly complaining\nor saying negative things,\nthen that could be a\nreason people ignore you.\nAccording to a study, people\navoid negativity at all costs,\nsince it can actually affect others' moods\nand overall well-being.\nSo it might be a good idea\nto take a quick reality check\nand make sure that you're\nnot a source of negativity\nfor your social group.\nNumber four, your presence\ndoesn't grab attention.\nDo you feel like people\ndon't pay too much attention\nto what you say,\neven when they just met you?\nThe reason people ignore you,\neven when you just met them,\nmight have something to do\nwith your public presence\nand your confidence levels.\nStudies show people tend to be attracted\nand pay more attention to those\nwho have high levels of confidence\nand make a positive first impression.\nSo if you feel like your presence\ndoes not grab enough attention,\ntaking steps towards increasing\nour levels of confidence\nmight be a good place to start.\nIt's important to work\non your body language\nand how you approach people\nwhen you engage in conversations.\nThese factors are key to making sure\nthat your presence is felt\nand people start paying\nattention to you more.\nAnd number five, you overthink\nwhat you're going to say.\nDo you consider yourself\nto be quiet during group conversations?\nDo you feel like the\nconversation moves faster\nand you can't find a\nwindow to hop into it?\nIf so, the most likely reason\nwhy you feel ignored during conversations\nis that you're overthinking\nwhat you're going to say.\nIt is very natural and\nalmost everyone does it.\nWhen you overthink during conversations,\nyou may get the feeling that\nyou're participating a lot\nbecause of all the things\nthat you're considering in your head.\nBut in reality, you speak\nmuch less than you think.\nAnd people can get the impression\nthat you're not interested.\nTherefore, others may ignore you\nsimply because they think\nyou don't want to socialize.\nHowever, rest assured that\nnot everything is your fault.\nYou can only control your own behavior,\nnot other people's behavior.\nIt is important to remember\nthat doing the things addressed above\ndoes not make you a bad person.\nThere is always a chance\nthat those ignoring you\nare simply not interested.\nThere is no need to\nchange yourself for people\nwho are not interested in\nforming a relationship with you.\nInstead, it's better\nto redirect that energy\ninto people who are actually\ninterested and care for you.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some habits that might cause people\nto ignore what you say.\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nWhich do you think is most potent?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them,\nif you'd
