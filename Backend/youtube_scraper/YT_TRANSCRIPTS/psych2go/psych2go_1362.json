    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nWhat does your internal\ndialogue sound like?\nSelf-talk is the way you naturally\ncommunicate with yourself\nthroughout the day.\nIt can be positive or negative,\nand it can influence your self-esteem,\nself-worth, and confidence.\nWhen it comes to negative self-talk,\nthere are some phrases that\ncan be particularly damaging\nto your well-being.\nWith that, here are six\ndangerous self-talk phrases\nyou should stop using.\nNumber one, \"I am worthless.\"\nWhat determines your worth?\nFor many people,\nself-worth can be influenced\nby a number of factors.\nIt can be easy to let other people,\ncertain moments, or situations\ndiminish your worth.\nHowever, the biggest thing to remember\nis that self-worth is and\nwill always be internal.\nIt blossoms from the way\nyou speak to yourself\nand the way you view yourself,\nnot how others view you.\nNumber two, \"It's not worth trying.\"\nHave you ever stopped yourself\nfrom trying something new?\nDid you tell yourself\nthat you'll probably fail\nbefore you even started?\nWhile you may be\nintending to save yourself\nfrom any potential embarrassment,\nyou're inadvertently\nstunting your own growth.\nWe tend to underestimate ourselves,\nbut sometimes our potential\njust might surprise us\nif we give it the chance.\nNumber three, \"I'm not enough.\"\nIn this increasingly competitive world,\nit can be easy to undercut\nyour own accomplishments.\nCriticism from others or slight\nsetbacks can make us forget\nabout the things we do well\nand make us feel like\nwe aren't doing enough\nor that we simply aren't good enough.\nThis phrase can be detrimental\nto your self-esteem and confidence.\nYou are enough and so valuable as you are\nno matter what setbacks you face each day.\nNumber four, \"I'm too sensitive.\"\nHave you ever called\nyourself too sensitive\nwhen you are angry\nrather than letting yourself\nfeel all of the emotions?\nIt's a common thing to do,\nbut sometimes it results\nin you diminishing\nyour own feelings.\nIf something bothers you, it bothers you.\nAnd it's totally okay\neven if other people don't think\nsomething should upset you.\nIt doesn't make your\nfeelings any less important\nor any less real.\nNumber five, \"I don't deserve love.\"\nHave you ever thought\nyou didn't deserve love?\nIf so, you aren't alone.\nThese thoughts are common,\nand they're detrimental to your well-being\nbecause they cause issues with\nself-esteem and self-worth.\nAccording to Dr. Jerabek from PsychTests,\nvarious life experiences\ncan negatively affect\nthe way we view ourselves, love ourselves,\nand respect ourselves.\nMaking a conscious effort\nto treat ourselves with love\nand respect will not only\nincrease our personal happiness\nbut also serve as an example\nof how we wanna be treated\nby those around us.\nAnd number six,\n\"I'm a failure.\"\nWhen something goes wrong,\nwhat do you tell yourself?\nWell, a common response would\nbe to call yourself a failure.\nWhen nothing is going your way,\nthis label may seem like\nthe only appropriate thing\nto call yourself.\nHowever, many of us don't realize\nhow damaging it can actually be\nto let ourselves believe\nthat we're failures\neven when we have failed.\nIn these moments,\nrather than add to your own adversity,\nthe best thing you can do\nfor yourself is to become\nyour biggest support system.\nStepping on yourself will\nonly discourage you even more.\nBut being kind to yourself,\neven as you acknowledges\nsetback can encourage you\nto rebuild and come back stronger.\nWe hope this helps you learn\nabout some self-talk phrases\nthat could damage your well-being.\nDo you relate to any of these points?\nDid we miss anything?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight\nin this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the sources used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching,\nand we'll see you next time."
