    "transcript": "Narcissistic parents often\nview their children as a way\nto serve their selfish\nneeds and ambitions.\nThe child's individuality is denied\nand the child simply\nbecomes a mere extension\nand reflection of the parents.\nAccording to Melissa Burkley PhD,\n\"Narcissistic parents love\nwhat their children can do\nfor them and their children's achievements\nbecause of how they reflect well on them.\"\nNumber two, your parent's\nlove is conditional.\nHave you ever received showers\nof praise and affections\nwhen you get an A on a test,\nbut as soon as you're\nconfused about an assignment\nor get a bad grade,\nyour parents tell you that\nyou are a disappointment.\nFor narcissistic parents,\nlove comes with conditions.\nIt's hard to receive\nunconditional and stable love\nfrom such parents.\nThese parents only support their children\nfor high achievement instead of letting\ntheir children explore\nwhat they're interested in\nand genuinely like.\nSuch children will only\nfeel secure and worthwhile\nwhen they're recognized as the best.\nNumber three, your parents feel\nthey are superior to others.\nHave your parents ever wanted\nyou to stop interacting\nwith a friend who came\nfrom a poor household\nor something similar?\nA narcissistic parent always\nfeels superior to other people\nand often finds pleasure in advertising\ntheir material possessions,\naccomplishments,\ncontacts with higher ups, and/or\ntrophy spouse and children.\nThey think they're special\nand should only associate\nwith other special or high status people.\nThey have no problem\ngoing out of their way\nto fish out flattery and\nego boosting admiration\nfrom others.\nThe key message is,\n\"Hey, look at me.\nI have what you don't have.\"\nNumber four,\nyour parents are dismissive\nand unwilling to identify\nwith your feelings and those of others.\nHave you ever tried to\ntalk to your parents\nabout something embarrassing\nthat happened at school,\nbut your parents dismissed\nit and talked about something\nthat happened to them at work that day?\nNarcissists see situations and people\nthrough a selfish lens.\nSuch parents merely think\nof how a certain situation\npersonally affects them\nand are unwilling to consider\nthe feelings and thoughts\nof their children.\nNumber five, your parents compare you\nto your siblings, friends,\nand the kids of their friends.\nNarcissistic parents have a\nhabit of engaging one child\nin needless comparison with\nanother child or peers.\nTheir intention is to use\ntheir children's inferiority\nas a motivator.\nWhat they want is for\ntheir children to fight\nfor their attention and approval.\nNumber six, your parents become furious\nwhen something doesn't go their way,\nno matter how small.\nHave you ever found yourself tiptoeing\naround your parent's temper?\nYou feel like you're walking on eggshells.\nNarcissistic parents are often\nblinded to their own faults,\nbut are always keen to point\nout the flaws in others.\nA harmless misunderstanding\nwith their children is viewed\nas a personal attack.\nThey view themselves as perfect.\nNothing can ever be their fault\nand they are always the victim.\nNumber seven, your parents\nguilt trip you with fear,\nobligation, and guilt.\nHave your parents ever used\ntheir own death to get you\nto feel bad about not\nwanting to do something?\nNarcissistic parents often\nuse fear, obligation,\nand guilt on their children\nto cause the feeling of guilt.\nThey want their children\nto submit to their wishes\nwithout considering what\ntheir children really feel\nand think.\nNumber eight, you struggle\nwith healthy boundaries\nbecause there were none growing up.\nIn narcissistic parenting\nthere is a refusal\nto acknowledge the child as separate\nfrom the parents as they view their child\nas an extension of themselves.\nThis results in muddy\nboundaries with their children\nin which the children's boundaries overlap\nwith their parent's boundaries\nand an unhealthy parasitic manner.\nThe parents believe that\nthey have the autonomy\nto define, dictate, and dominate\nthe children's thoughts,\nfeelings, opinions, and identity.\nGrowing up with easily permeable\nand dysfunctional boundaries\nwill hinder the children\nfrom developing healthy boundaries\nin future relationships.\nNumber nine, your accomplishments\nare never your own doing.\nConsider this scenario.\nYou receive congratulations\nfrom your school's principal\nfor receiving a valedictorian award\nfor your high school graduation.\nYour mother, who is\nattending the award ceremony,\nsuddenly chimes in,\n\"Because I put my full\nfocus on her achievements\nsince she was young and\nshe gets it all from me.\"\nWhat are your thoughts\nabout this scenario?\nWhat do you notice?\nThe mother makes it all about her.\nIt's thanks to her that she's\nbeen shaping her daughter\nthat way since young.\nIt's thanks to her\nthat her daughter received\nthe valedictorian award.\nShe never associates the achievements\nwith her daughter's own hard work.\nShe never validates the teacher's role\nin teaching her child.\nFor narcissistic parents,\nthey always steal the thunder\nand it always revolves around them.\nNumber 10, you become codependent.\nGrowing up with narcissistic\nparents can lead to a sense\nof loss of self in the children.\nNarcissistic parents often\ndepend on their children\nfor validation to get\ntheir narcissistic supply.\nThe narcissists also control all facets\nof the children's life\nthus hindering the children's autonomy\nand sense of independence.\nDue to this, the children\nbecome codependent.\nCodependent is defined as\nsomeone who feels accountable\nfor another person's feelings, problems,\nand behaviors to the\nexpense of themselves.\nThey're willing to abandon\ntheir own safety, emotional,\nmental, and physical\nwellbeing to take care\nof their parents.\nIf you find that the above points resonate\nwith your relationship with your parents,\nit's highly recommended to seek therapy,\nespecially if you're struggling\nwith things like anxiety,\ndepression, or trauma as a result.\nAs for the narcissistic parent,\nit's very important for\nthem to be motivated\nto improve themselves in order\nfor a change to take place.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the
