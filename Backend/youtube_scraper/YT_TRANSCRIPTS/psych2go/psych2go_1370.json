    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nand welcome back to another video.\nThank you so much for all of the love\nand support that you've given us.\nHere at Psych2Go, our\nmission is to make content\non mental health and self care\nmore accessible to everyone.\nNow, let's begin.\nEveryone at some point\nleaves relationships,\njobs, and friendships.\nSometimes it ends up being a blessing\nbecause they weren't right for us anyway.\nBut what if you can't\nmove on or get over it?\nWhat gives?\nIs this just you not being\nable to get it together,\nor is there something a\nlittle more sinister at play?\nUnhealed relationship trauma is far deeper\nthan you being stressed or\nrelationship challenged.\nIt's being unable to move on\nbecause of your previous relationship.\nBefore we begin, we want to let you know\nthat the goal of this video\nis to help you understand\nrelationship trauma and possibly\nhow this may apply to you.\nWith that being said, here are seven signs\nyou may have unhealed relationship trauma.\nOne, annoying physical symptoms.\nDo you feel completely drained\nafter a long-term relationship ended?\nA study shows unresolved trauma can make\nnormal aches and pains worse.\nThis seems to stem from\ntrauma putting your body\non constant high alert, which\nis due to the activation\nof your physiological fight,\nflight or freeze response.\nA toxic relationship is\nstressful for your mind and body.\nYour body's stress response\nwas only a meant to last\nfor a short amount of time.\nBut as several experts have noted,\nputting your body under stress\nfor long periods of time\ncan lead to increased\ninflammation, arthritis,\nheart attacks, weakened immune\nsystems and chronic pain.\nTwo, your body and mind feel disconnected.\nSince you and your ex broke up,\ndo people tell you that you\nhave your head in the clouds?\nHave you started feeling\nlike your life was some movie\nyou were watching from the outside\nwhen the relationship started getting bad?\nThese are features of disassociation\nor feeling detached from reality.\nA study noted people who\nseek help from trauma\noften report feelings of disassociation.\nDisassociation involves the\ndisruption of your perceptions,\nmemory, processing and emotions.\nThese include acting or feeling as though\na traumatic event is still occurring.\nThree, your brain works differently.\nAfter ending a toxic or\ntraumatic relationship,\ndid you notice getting a lot of brain fog,\nforgetfulness or racing thoughts?\nThis is because the stress\nfrom a toxic relationship\nand your body's response\nto the stress is ongoing.\nThe stress hormones\nadrenaline and cortisol\nwere not meant to be in your system longer\nthan a few minutes at a time.\nConstantly having them in your system\nchanges the way parts\nof your brain function.\nSo you're probably gonna\nnotice you can't concentrate,\nyour memory stinks,\nyou feel out of control\nor have racing thoughts,\nand you have a hard time\nfiguring out how to feel.\nYou get frustrated or angry easily.\nFour, major trust issues,\neven with people you know and love.\nHave you put up walls around you?\nIs it hard to believe in others now?\nIn addition to changing the way\nparts of your brain functions,\nthe trauma brought on\nby a toxic relationship\nmesses with your ability\nto feel safe with another person.\nThis anxiety might cause\nyour mind to come up\nwith every possible\ndoomsday scenario you can\nin order to protect yourself.\nAs a result, you doubt even\nthose who only want your good\nand have done you no wrong.\nFive, you might pick fights\nor engage in risky business.\nUnresolved trauma sufferers\nconstantly feel on edge.\nSo they sometimes behave in\nrisky ways to seek sensations,\nAKA get a rush, as a way to\nfeel like they have control\nor to get a break from trauma symptoms,\nsuch as replaying the trauma, depression,\nor over-analyzing their faults.\nEmotional flashbacks and\nall the biochemical changes\ncreated by toxicity makes\nyou feel like you're still\nin the toxic relationship.\nYou feel like you have\nto fight to survive,\neven if your present\nsituation is perfectly safe.\nPeople who experience\ndisassociation as a result of trauma\nare more likely to lash out aggressively\nthan those who are not\nprone to disassociation.\nSix, a constant sense of shame.\nWow, I'm a horrible person,\nor why didn't I see it before?\nI'm so stupid for staying.\nAnd I'm such a doormat.\nThese are the common thought processes\nby those who have lingering\nrelationship trauma.\nThey blame themselves for\nthings not working out,\nand they're ashamed.\nThe big difference here boils\ndown to built and shame.\nGuilt means you feel bad\nabout something you did.\nShame means you feel bad\nabout who or what you are.\nToo much shame or guilt\ncan not only be paralyzing,\nbut is also associated with trauma.\nResearch has shown toxic\nshame can make the mental,\nemotional, and physical\nsymptoms of trauma much worse.\nAnd seven, you react physically\nto emotional triggers.\nHave you ever heard a\nsong or seen a picture\nthat made you feel nostalgic?\nWhen you have unhealed\nrelationship trauma,\ntriggers that seem normal\ntake a much darker turn.\nThese triggers become\nmore intense over time\nas the memories associated with the trauma\nbecome more intrusive.\nResearchers believe\nthese physical reactions\nare due to the amygdala\nand the neurotransmitter\nacetylcholine in the stress response.\nA physical reaction to a\ntrauma trigger might look like\nshortness of breath and sweating\nwhen your boss questions\nyou, certain songs or phrases\ngive you anxiety, or you feel sick\nwhen you smell certain foods.\nMaybe you start getting\nchest pains or shaking\nwhen people innocently bring\nup your old line of work\nor your ex's favorite restaurant.\nTrauma is deeper than\nbeing stuck in the past.\nThe symptoms of unhealed\nrelationship trauma can hurt you.\nBut by taking the time to learn\nabout what you've experienced,\nyou can start figuring out\nhow you can start healing.\nYour healing journey may\nnot go in a straight line,\nand it certainly won't be\nperfect and that's fine.\nJust as long as you keep putting one foot\nin front of the other.\nCould you relate to any of these signs?\nHave you noticed these\nin someone around you?\nYou let us know in the comments below.\nAlso remember to like and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nSubscribed to Psych2Go for more content,\nand as always, thanks for watching."
