    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Ah, food.\nDelicious food.\nWhere would we be without\nthe savory delight\nof roasted chicken wings\nor the sweet sensation\nof melting chocolate?\nDid you know that what you decide to eat,\nespecially your favorite food,\nsays a lot about who you are?\nYour favorite food can reveal\na lot about your personality.\nPeople also view your\npersonality differently\ndepending on what foods are your favorite.\nA study by Dr. Alan Hirsch, a\nneurologist and psychiatrist,\nfound that job satisfaction is related\nto your favorite savory snack.\n\"A person's job selection\nreflects his essential essence\nand his personality,\" he says.\nFood choices can provide insight\ninto personality and character structure.\nIf you'd like to know what\nkind of person you are based\non what foods you ultimately\nalways tend to crave,\nthis is for you.\nNumber one, you like sweet\nfoods, especially chocolate.\nMm, have you got your\nhand on the cookie jar?\nGotcha, you aren't afraid\nto get your hands dirty\ngetting a taste of those\nsweet chocolate chip cookies\nevery now and then, huh?\nWell, while you may not be agreeable\nabout how much sweet food you eat,\nyou are in everything else.\nAccording to a study published\nin the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology,\nresearchers found that people view those\nwho love sweet foods as\nmore agreeable, friendly,\nand pleasant all around.\nAnother study revealed\nthat those who chose\nto eat a piece of chocolate\nrather than a non-sweet food were found\nto likely volunteer more\nand help others in need.\nAren't they just the sweetest?\nNumber two, you take risks\nand enjoy spicy foods.\nAre you an adrenaline junkie at heart?\nIs risk taking your true calling?\nA study by the Institute of\nFood Technologists revealed\nthat if you enjoy risk-taking\nand intense stimulation,\nyou are likely to enjoy\nspicy food as well.\nIn the study, Burns assessed participants\nusing the Arnett Inventory\nof Sensation Seeking,\nor the AISS, a personality test to assess\nif you indeed are sensation seeking\nand motivated towards risk preferences.\nSubjects were given an active\ningredient in chili peppers\nand had to rate how much they liked it.\nThose who enjoyed the food\ndespite the increasing burn\nwere found to have higher\nscores on the AISS test.\nEven as spicy taco is\nquite the risk after all,\nwouldn't you agree?\nNumber three, your go-to\nsnack is potato chips.\nAre you eyeing that\nfamily sized bag of chips?\nAccording to Hirsch, it seems\nif you love potato chips,\nyou are successful and ambitious.\nYou have high expectations of\nyourself as well as others.\nYou tend to get frustrated\nby life's inconveniences.\nYour competitive spirit aides you\non your journey to success.\nAccording to Hirsch, those\nwho prefer potato chips\nare the most aggressive, the go-getters\nand the ones that never accept a no.\nNumber four, snacking on pretzels.\nWould you rather choose a bowl\nof crunchy pretzels over any other snack?\nIf so, you easily grow bored with routine\nand seek novelty in your life,\naccording to Hirsch's study.\nYour decisions are based on\nyour intuition and passion.\nYour emotions lead your life choices\nas opposed to logically\nbreaking down a decision,\nand this is especially\ntrue for your love life.\nAs you pursue romance, you, of course,\nlet your heart lead the way.\nYou are excited by any\nchallenge that comes your way,\nespecially one involving eating\nan entire bag of pretzels.\nNumber five, tortilla chips.\nMm, the deliciously warm\ntaste of a buttered tortilla,\nwhat's better?\nYup, you got that right, tortilla chips.\nIf you can't seem to satiate your urge\nfor munching tortilla chips, odds are,\nyou're a perfectionist.\nBut this trait extends\nbeyond your own actions,\nto the community at large,\nmaking you a humanitarian,\nwho is often distressed by inequities\nand injustices of society,\naccording to Hirsch.\n- Me, a perfectionist?\nOne sec, let me handle something.\nI said, \"Bake the toy\nfor 18 minutes, not 20.\"\n- [Narrator] Where were we?\nNumber six, cheese.\nDelicious, soft, melty, splendid cheese.\nLove cheese?\nIf you can't stop yourself\nfrom those extra toppings of cheese,\nthis one's for you.\nYou have a defined\nsense of right and wrong\nand treat everyone fairly.\nYou're likely described as formal,\nconscientious and always proper,\naccording to Hirsch's study.\nIf you love cheese curls,\nthis means you also love to plan ahead\nand foresee future catastrophes.\nNumber seven, bring on the meat.\nIf you love meat, then\naccording to Hirsch,\nit looks like you are the type\nwho is gregarious and generous to a fault.\nGuess what?\nYou're also the type to think\nof another's comfort before your own.\nAw, you'll even risk your own comfort\nto please those around you.\nIf you love a good steak,\nyour friends can always count on you.\nNumber eight, how do\nyou like them crackers?\nCan't resist those irresistible crackers?\nThen you are contemplative and thoughtful\nbased on Hirsch's studies.\nYou base all your decisions\non logic rather than emotion.\nBizarrely enough, Hirsch claims\nthat those who prefer crackers\nmay easily find themselves\nromantically involved\nin an internet relationship.\nMm, you probably wouldn't\nmind having a date\nover the internet over a\nbowl of crackers, would you?\nNumber nine, fruits and vegetables\nare the apple of your eye,\nthen the apple to your pie\nor a cucumber to your salad.\nAre you quick to fix yourself a salad bowl\nbefore heading out?\nHave you stocked your refrigerator full\nwith all your salad essentials?\nIf you are conscientious\nof your eating habits\nand like to eat a healthy salad or two,\ntopped off with some yummy fruits,\nthen you have an open\nview and personality,\naccording to a 2015 study\npublished in the journal Appetite.\nYou are willing to try new\nexperiences and do new things.\nIf you favor eating more healthy\nitems, as opposed to meat,\nyou likely have a\nconscientious personality.\nAnd number 10, you adore\nhigh calorie foods.\nAre you not afraid to\nget your hands greasy?\nDo you choose the high calorie foods\nover the healthy option most of the time?\nThis food choice is characteristic\nof the neurotic type.\nThe 2015 study published in\nthe journal Appetite found\nthat neurotic people ate\nmore high calorie foods\nincluding sweets and engaged\nmore in emotional eating.\nSo what's your favorite food?\nAnd does your personality match up?\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the ways your favorite foods\ncan be a window to your personality.\nDid any of these points describe
