    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2goers.\nWhat do you feel when you\nthink about your childhood?\nDo you think of it as a happy place\nyou'd give anything to get back to?\nOr would you rather\npretend it never happened?\nUnfortunately, sometimes parents\nare not the ones who know best\nand the choices they make\nwhile raising their children\ncan leave their children traumatized.\nSometimes these mistakes\nare really honest,\naccidental mistakes made because\nthey don't really know better,\nbut sometimes they're not.\nWhatever the reason is,\nthe result is often the same,\nan unhappy child,\nbringing their pain with\nthem into adulthood.\nHere are five of the mistakes parents make\nthat can leave their children traumatized.\nNumber one, fighting in front of children.\nDo you remember your parents\nfighting in front of you\nwhen you were a kid?\nUnfortunately, this is\ntrue for many of us.\nArguing is a normal and healthy\naspect of a relationship,\nbut sometimes it's a full-blown fight\nwith yelling, name calling,\nand sometimes even violent behaviors\nlike throwing or punching stuff.\nIt gets even worse when they choose\nto ignore a child sitting in front of them\nor listening to them through\nthe walls of their room.\nA study from the University of Oregon\nshows that the negative\neffects of a parent's fight\ncan impact children as\nyoung as six months old.\nAnd of course,\nnegative impacts go from\ninfancy to adolescence.\nListening or watching their parents argue\ncan cause insecurities,\nnegatively impact\nparent-child relationships,\nand create a stressful environment\nin which a child has little\nopportunity to grow happily.\nAnd when they do grow,\nthey still have to deal\nwith long-term effects\nof the trauma they went through.\nBeing more prone to experience\ndepression and anxiety,\ndifficulty regulating their\nattention and emotions,\ndropping out of school,\nhaving unhealthy relationships\nand attachment problems,\nand physical issues like\ndifficulty sleeping or eating.\nNumber two, using corporal punishment.\nCorporal punishment is physical abuse\ndesperately trying to hide\nunder a mask of discipline.\nHow many times have you\nheard a parent talk about\nhow they discipline their\nchildren by spanking them,\npulling their ears,\nhitting them with a belt\nor throwing things at them?\nAnd how many times have\nyou heard grown people\ntelling stories about how they\nwere physically disciplined\nand they turned out just fine?\nMaybe they think they\nturned out just fine,\nbut that's not the case for many people\nthat still suffer from\nthe consequences of corporal punishment.\nAnd no matter what stance parents take,\nprofessionals strongly advise\nagainst this type of punishment.\nThe American Academy of Pediatrics, AAP,\nencourages parents and caregivers\nto refrain from using corporal punishment\nand try healthy forms\nof discipline instead.\nStudies have shown that\ncorporal punishment\nis ineffective in the long run,\ncould possibly make the\nbehavior even worse,\ndamage the relationship with\nthe child and their parents,\nand increase aggressive behavior.\nNumber three, playing favorites.\nWhat was your sibling\nthe golden favorite child of your family?\nFavoritism is something that happens often\nin families with more siblings.\nWhether parents don't even notice\nthey're treating one child better,\nor whether they do it on purpose.\nMaybe they praise one of their kids more,\nallow them stuff they don't\nallow their other children,\nor give their favorite\nchild more attention.\nNo matter how it's displayed\nor the reason behind it,\nit harms the other siblings.\nBeing constantly compared to\nyour siblings in a bad way,\ncan make them think that\nthey don't matter as much.\nThey might think they can't\nlive up to the high standards\nor like their family would\nfeel happier without them.\nThose feelings of worthlessness\nand low self-esteem\nare not reserved only for their childhood.\nOnce they reach adulthood,\nunresolved problems from their past\ncan impact their friendships,\nromantic relationships,\nand ultimately even relationships\nwith their own children.\nNumber four, emotional neglect.\nEmotional neglect happens\nwhen a parent fails\nto adequately respond to\ntheir child's emotional needs.\nIt's different from emotional abuse,\nbecause neglecting emotional needs\nmay not happen intentionally.\nEmotionally neglected children\nmay have everything\nthey need taken care of\nlike food, shelter and healthcare.\nBut when it comes to their feelings,\ntheir parents can be\ndistant and unattentive.\nInstead of offering\nthem advice and comfort,\ntheir parents tell them they should\njust ignore their problems\nand not talk about them anymore.\nThey fail to acknowledge\ntheir child's emotional needs\nand they leave their child\nto take care of their\nown problems on their own\nwithout even listening to them.\nAs time goes by,\nthose children might\nstop asking for advice\nand internalize their problems further.\nThey may also have a risk\nof developmental delays,\nlow self-esteem, and withdraw\nfrom friends and activities.\nThis trauma continues until adulthood\nwhen they can suffer from\npost-traumatic stress disorder,\ndepression, emotional\nunavailability, and trust issues.\nAnd number five, emphasizing\ngood grades too much.\nEvery parent wants their\nchild to do well in school,\nbut sometimes parents cross the line.\nInstead of being healthily encouraging,\nthey become obsessed\nwith their kids' grades,\nmaking it the center of their worlds.\nA study from Arizona\nState University in 2016,\nshowed that too much pressure\nwhen it comes to good grades\ncould be counterproductive.\nParents who put too much focus on grades\nare indirectly minimizing the importance\nof social skills and compassion,\nwhich can make children fail\nat becoming well adjusted individuals\nand contributing members of society.\nMore importantly, when\nparents put such pressure\non their kids during\ntheir formative years,\nthey're causing high\nstress levels and anxiety.\nAs a result, children whose parents\nkept pushing them to achieve\neven better than they could\nwere more likely to\nexperience negative outcomes,\nsuch as depression,\nanxiety, lower self-esteem,\nbehavior problems, learning problems,\nas well as lower grades.\nIt makes them miss out on\nthe best time of their lives\nbecause they spend their time\nstudying behind closed doors,\ntrying to reach unreachable expectations.\nSo, did you relate to any of these,\neither as a child of these\nmistakes or as a parent?\nIf you're a parent watching this,\ntry to keep an open mind for some changes\nwhen it comes to raising your children.\nIf you see your parents reflected in this,\nit may be helpful to reach out\nto a mental health professional\nto deal with the complex feelings\nand concerns you may be struggling with.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find some\ninsight in the video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2go\nand hit the
