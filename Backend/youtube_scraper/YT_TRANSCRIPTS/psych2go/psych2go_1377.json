    "transcript": "Where is that one place\nyou spend most of your time\nand love decorating?\nDid you know that beyond\nbeing your safe space,\nyour bedroom says a lot about\nyour personality and habits?\nYour very own choice in\nselecting decor, furniture,\nand your organizational\nhabits are telling on you.\nWho knew, right?\nWhy is your bedroom so special to you?\n\"It's where I sleep.\n\"It's the only place to get\nsome much needed alone time.\"\nRight you are,\nbut it goes deeper than that.\nWhy did Native Americans make pottery\nwith earthy tones and designs\nbased upon plants and animals?\nThroughout time, people have\nmanifested their identities\nthrough objects around them.\nThe same principle applies now as well,\nwhere we often pick items for our bedroom\nthat reflect who we are\nand who we wanna be.\nYour bedroom is an extension of you,\nkeeping you grounded to who you are.\nIn Malcolm Gladwell's bestseller,\n\"Blink: The Power of\nThinking Without Thinking,\"\nhe references personality psychologist\nSamuel Gosling's experiment,\nwhich established a link between\nbedrooms and personality.\nGosling's experiment asked total strangers\nto guess the personality of students\njust by observing their dorms,\nand their guesses were more accurate\nthan the ones their close friends made.\nWhat?\nSo Gosling used the results\nto break down the personality\nrevealing aspects of a bedroom\ninto three factors.\nIn this video, we'll be\ndiscussing the three factors\nthat specify how your space reflect you.\nNumber one, identity claims.\nSo, let's take a look around your room.\nIs that your favorite book over there?\nWhat's covering every other\ninch of your wall, and why?\nIdentity claims are what you\nare and what you wanna be.\nIt's your attempt in shaping\nother's opinions of you.\nThese openly reveal\nchunks of your personality\nfor others to see.\nYou put them out there for a reason,\nand they're doing their job well.\nThey're often items related\nto your hobbies and interests\nthat you brandish about your room.\nFor example, trophies and\nmedals from playing sports\nor posters from your favorite franchise\nall around your room.\nThese show anyone who enters your room\nyour tastes and preferences.\nThey also say a great deal about you\nand what your interests are.\nYour sports trophies show\nyou're an avid athlete.\nOn the other hand,\nmounds of books and to\nbe read piles all around,\nsay you're a bookworm through and through.\nBy looking at what you've chosen\nto display around your room,\nyou can get a feel for what you prioritize\nas the highlights of your life\nand what you want your life to emulate.\nNumber two, behavioral residue.\nDo you have to shove things under your bed\nwhen people come around?\nDo you often leave your shoes lying about?\nWhat did you do with that fresh pile\nof laundry you just brought in?\nUnlike identity claims, behavioral residue\nis what you unconsciously\ndo with your room.\nIt's all in the little things you do\nwhen you aren't paying attention.\nIt could be leaving your dresser open\nor close out on the floor.\nThese small habits say a lot as well.\nFor example, if you\nleave your dresser open\nor procrastinate putting\naway your clothing,\nyou might be someone who\nis bigger picture-oriented.\nOn the other hand, if your\nroom is always neat and tidy,\nthis shows that you're someone\nwho is detail-oriented.\nHowever, aside from your intuitive habits,\nbehavioral residue\nincludes unconscious acts\nthat you wouldn't want others to see.\nIn other words,\nif you took the time to\nthink consciously about them,\nyou wouldn't do them.\nWhen people come into your room,\nyou make it as presentable as possible,\nwhich often entails putting away clothing\nand shoving potentially\nembarrassing things under your bed.\nYou don't wanna show people\nyour disorganized room,\nnor do you wanna show them\nanything you're embarrassed about.\nThus, by looking at behavioral residue,\nyou can see what you don't show people\nand sometimes wish wasn't a\npart of your life to begin with.\nNumber three, thoughts\nand feeling regulators.\nAre you a fan of scented candles?\nHave you put up any motivational quotes\naround your study space?\nAll of these can be called your thoughts\nand feeling regulators.\nThese are the things you put in your room\nto help your mental health.\nThey could be photos to\nremind you of happy times\nor scented candles to uplift your mood.\nThese self-care items reflect\nhow conscious you are of yourself.\nBy having a lot of them around your room,\nchances are you're well\nattuned to your emotional needs\nand what makes you happy.\nIf you don't have them\nas a staple in your room,\nyou might still be in the process\nof figuring out your emotional\nneeds and what uplifts you.\nBy looking at what you\nput around your room\nto regulate your mood,\nothers can get a sense\nof the people, places,\nand activities that you enjoy most.\nSimply put, your bedroom is\nyour mind's physical home;\nso it stabilizes, organizes,\nand embodies your identity.\nThis is the reason why you\nfeel most at home at home.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you a little insight\ninto the ways your space defines you.\nDid you learn anything from your bedroom?\nPerhaps it was something\nyou've just noticed\nafter inspecting it closely.\nFeel free to comment down below\nwhat your bedroom says about you.\nIf you found this video interesting,\nbe sure to hit the Like button\nand share it with others\nto help them
