    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWhat comes to your mind\nwhen you think of someone\nwith good self-esteem,\nconfidence, and determination?\nFor most of us, this is the\nkind of person we aspire to be:\nmore fearless, outspoken,\nand strong-willed.\nIn reality, however,\npeople who are like this\nsometimes rub other people the wrong way.\nTheir personality may be so strong\nthat some would feel intimidated by it.\nDoes this sound like you?\nIf so, here are 10 signs you have\na strong and intimidating personality.\nNumber one: you're a natural-born leader.\nDo you often find yourself taking charge\nand leading the group when\nno one else is willing to?\nDo people turn to you when\nthey don't know what to do next\nor how to accomplish it?\nIf so, it's likely that\nyou have a focused,\nconfident, assertive, and\ngoal-oriented personality,\nall of which makes for a great leader.\nThe downside, however, is\nthat some of these qualities\nmay make you come across\nas too serious, bossy,\nor controlling, which may end\nup putting some people off.\nNumber two: you're\nunapologetically yourself.\nAre you comfortable in your own skin?\nIf so, it's likely you have a strong\nand intimidating personality.\nIt takes a lot of courage and confidence\nto be able to be\nunapologetically yourself.\nWhen you don't need to look\nfor validation elsewhere\nbecause you know your own worth,\nyou won't let anyone stop\nyou from being who you are.\nStrong-willed and fiercely independent,\nyou march to the beat of your\nown drum and yours alone.\nNumber three: you're brutally honest.\nAre you able or more\nwilling to say and do things\nthat others are afraid of?\nHaving a brutally honest nature can add\nto a strong and intimidating personality.\nSince you're not one to walk on eggshells\nor to beat around the bush,\nyou're able to just come out\nand tell people what you\nthink they need to hear.\nYou can speak your mind\nbecause it's what you think\nis the right thing to do.\nNumber four: you question\ninstead of conform.\nDo you like to do things your own way?\nWhile most people might be satisfied\nwith simply accepting the status quo\nand doing things the way\nthey've always been done,\nyou like to question things.\nAnalytical, original, and\nopen-minded, you're driven\nto discover new ideas and\nnew ways of doing things\nbecause you're always looking\nto improve and be better.\n\"If it ain't broke, don't fix it\"\nis not something you'd ever agree with.\nNumber five: you don't make excuses.\nAnother sign of a strong\nand intimidating personality\nhas to do with determination.\nBeing tenacious and steadfast,\nespecially when you set\nyour mind to something,\nmay make you the type to say,\n\"You can have results or you\ncan have excuses, not both.\"\nWhether it's with yourself\nor with other people,\nyou make sure to set clear goals\nand plans that you expect to be followed.\nNumber six: you're careful\nabout who you let in.\nDo you tend to be more guarded\nwhen you're around other people?\nYou may be someone who wants to be sure\nthat someone is really worth trusting\nbefore you let yourself open up to them.\nBut in wanting to protect\nyourself and your energy,\nyour first impression\nto some may come across\nas cold and intimidating.\nNumber seven: you overcome\nyour insecurities.\nEveryone struggles with\ntheir own insecurities.\nWe all have flaws and\nshortcomings, and oftentimes,\nwe all do what we can to\nlearn to live with them.\nBut instead of avoiding or denying them,\nhaving the ability to choose\nto face your insecurities head-on\nand to work on overcoming them\ncan increase your self-confidence.\nThis in turn can add to a strong\nand intimidating personality.\nNumber eight: you have a strong\nsense of right and wrong.\nDo you tend to stand\nfirm in your principles?\nHaving a strong sense of right and wrong\nand being unwilling to\ncompromise your values,\nno matter how hard things are,\nis a sign that you live your life\naccording to your strong moral values,\nnot to other people's opinions.\nThis can take a lot of\ncourage and confidence,\nwhich, again, may come off\nas strong and intimidating.\nNumber nine: you are driven and ambitious.\nDo you have goals or plans\nyou've set your eyes on?\nBeing driven and ambitious is often a sign\nthat you have a strong and\nintimidating personality\nbecause you won't let\nother people's opinions\naffect your path to your goals.\nYou may be the type\nwho'd rather be disliked\nfor their ambition than\nbe forced into mediocrity.\nYou have big dreams in\nlife, and you're committed\nto becoming the very best\nversion of yourself you can be,\nregardless of what other people may think.\nAnd number 10: you welcome challenges.\nLast, but certainly not least,\na sign you have a strong\nand intimidating personality\nis if you like to welcome challenges.\nWhile other people right\nrun away from conflict\nor let difficulties scare them\ninto giving up altogether,\nyou may get excited to\npush and challenge yourself\nand to relish in the opportunities\nfor growth and change.\nYou're not afraid of\nfailure because you know\nthat whatever happens, you're\nalways going to be able\nto pick yourself back up and try again.\nSince this quality is often quite rare\nand very admirable to have,\nyou may just end up intimidating\npeople because of it.\nDo you think you might have a strong\nand intimidating personality?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like,
