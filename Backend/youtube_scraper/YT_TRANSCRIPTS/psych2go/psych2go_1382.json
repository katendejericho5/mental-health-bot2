    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\n(gentle music)\nHave you ever felt like someone liked you\nonly to find they'd pull away\nright When you were\nemotionally connecting?\nMaybe they were giving you mixed signals\nor maybe you have a hunch they\nmight be afraid of rejection.\nFor many, fear of rejection prevents them\nfrom progressing emotionally\ninto a relationship.\nMany psychologists theorize\nthat when one goes through\nnegative experiences\ntheir feelings of love and\nfear can become connected.\nSeeing that there are research\nstudies backing this theory,\nyou might not be off in\nthinking that your date\nmight be hesitant going\ninto a new relationship\ndue to a past heartbreak.\nSo how can you tell?\nWell, here are six signs someone likes you\nbut is afraid of rejection.\nNumber one, they're nervous around you.\nWhen most people like someone,\nthey can become a little nervous,\nStammering, breaking out\nin sweats, and clammy hands\nmay just be signs that\nthey like you so much\nthat you make them nervous.\nAttraction can even make\nus a bit dumb sometimes.\nResearch has found that sexual arousal\nshuts off parts of the\nprefrontal cortex of the brain.\nThis region of the brain is responsible\nfor critical thinking, rational\nbehavior and self-awareness.\nSo if you have a hunch\nthey're afraid of rejection\nand can't quite tell if they like you,\nnext time you hold their\nhand, ask yourself,\nis it uncomfortably clammy?\nMm, looks like it's love.\nTwo, they do dorky things in\nan attempt to impress you.\nSo you still can't tell\nif they like you, huh?\nWell, do you find they\nmake random attempts\nto impress you every chance they get?\nIf someone likes you, odds are they'll try\nto make it a point to show off\nwhat makes them a suitable partner.\nOr they simply want to impress you\nbecause that means you'll notice them.\nIf their attempts are more\ndorky than impressive,\nthey're really trying to\nget you to notice them.\nThey may just be afraid to flat\nout tell you they like you.\nNumber three, they want\nto spend time with you,\nbut then suddenly disappear.\nA telltale sign they're\nafraid of rejection.\nJust when they start getting\nemotionally close to you,\nthey pull away suddenly.\nYour conversations are near daily.\nYou text each other good\nmorning and good night,\nbut then suddenly they\nstart to become busy\nand seemingly disappear.\nThey may be trying to see if\nyou're as interested as them.\nBut if you start to drift\naway in a reaction as well,\nthey often will come back to check on you.\nWhy?\nWell, because as much\nas they feel rejection,\nthey still can't help but care about you.\nNumber four, they've talked about you\nto the important people in their lives.\nIf you've heard from the\nimportant people in their life\nthat they can't stop talking about you,\nodds are they like you.\nIf they mentioned or even\nintroduced you to their family,\nthey may even want things to get serious,\nbut are a bit hesitant\ndue to the fear of\nrejection in the future.\nNumber five, they go out of\ntheir way to do things for you,\nbut don't like to talk\nabout their feelings.\nSome people have trouble\nexpressing their feelings and fears.\nSome may believe that expressing\ntheir feelings or fears\nwill only drive their spouse away.\nBut one of the most important aspects\nof a relationship, communication.\nIf your partner shies away\nfrom talking about their feelings,\nbut you notice they go out of their way\nto do things for you,\nthey likely like you.\nLikely like you.\nSay that three times fast.\nBut simply put, those\nwho don't often express\ntheir feelings show them\nthrough their actions.\nSo pay attention to what they do.\nIf they show they care for\nyou, they likely like you.\nAnd number six, they listen\nand remember what you say.\nCan you tell if your partner\nreally listens to you?\nIf you notice they actively\nlisten to what you say\nand remember details about\nyour conversation later on,\nthey're probably interested in you.\nWhen we care about someone,\nwe want to hear how their day was\nor listen in on their interests.\nAnd if your spouse brings\nup previous conversations\nor details about something you said,\nyou're likely on their mind.\nIf they like you, what's\nholding them back?\nIf it's rejection, here's\nto hoping their fears\nwill melt away when you\ntell them you like them,\nlike really like them.\nThat is, if they listen.\nSo do you recognize any of these signs\nin your partner or crush?\nHow will you let them know you like them?\nTell us in the comment section down below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share this with your crush.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching.\nSee you next time."
