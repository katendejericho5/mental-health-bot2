    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nAre you currently in a relationship\nyou feel isn't working out?\nYou may be trying your best\nto save what's left of the relationship\nand are making sure you're\nmaking the right decision.\nBut sometimes it's better to have a good,\nhealthy separation with someone\nrather than staying in\na dying relationship.\nThis is why it's helpful\nto understand some signs\nthat someone may not be for you.\nSo here are a few signs.\nNumber one.\nYou feel like you can't\nbe yourself around them.\nWhich parts of yourself do you change\nwhen you're with a person?\nIs it a certain\npersonality trait of yours,\nyour looks, your style?\nWhy?\nYou may feel like this\nbecause you're afraid of them\nviewing you in a certain way.\nThis is not a good sign\nbecause it means that you think\nthat they're only attracted\nto a certain idea of you.\nIf you feel like you have\nto alter a part of yourself\njust to meet another person's\nstandards or to be of value,\nyou might be going through\na personal problem,\nbrought on by self-esteem issues.\nThis type of behavior may be improved\nby talking to your\npartner, friends, family,\nor a mental health professional.\nPlease remember that you're\nbeautiful just the way you are\nand your self-worth isn't\ndetermined by the way you look.\nNumber two.\nYou always initiate\nconversations and dates.\nAre you always texting them first?\nIs it you who always reaches out to them\nand asks what they're\ndoing, how their day was,\nor if they wanna go out?\nDoes it feel like you're the\nonly one putting in the effort?\nSomeone being indifferent\ntowards your efforts\ncan actually have a negative\nimpact on your self-esteem.\nNot having open, healthy\ncommunication in your relationship\nmay cause anxiety and self-blame.\nBring this issue up with your partner\nto understand each other's\nsides of the stories\nand find solutions.\nIf this type of behavior\ndoesn't change after awhile,\nit's probably an indication\nthat this person really isn't for you\nbecause you're worth more than\na half-hearted relationship.\nNumber three.\nYou don't feel their trust.\nDo they often threaten\nyou with breaking up\nif you do something they don't like?\nAre they the overly jealous type?\nHave you been forbidden\nto talk to specific people\nbecause your partner doesn't like them?\nYour partner not trusting you\nmay be a manifestation\nof their own insecurity.\nThis might stem from many possible causes\nlike childhood upbringing or\nbad experiences in the past.\nIt's encouraged to talk to\nthem about this behavior\nand tell them how you feel when\nthey try to micromanage you.\nYou may also get help by\nencouraging them to talk to you,\ntheir loved ones, or a therapist.\nIf their behavior doesn't\nchange after awhile,\nthen it's probably best\nto give them some space\nto sort out their own\nproblems by themselves.\nNumber four.\nYou fight instead of\nhaving healthy arguments.\nArguments, if done right,\nare healthy parts of a relationship.\nThey can promote individuality, openness,\nand respect between partners.\nThrough arguments,\nyou learn more about the other person\nand their perspectives\non different topics.\nThis helps you view future\nevents through their lens\nand understand their ways of thinking.\nArguments stop being helpful\nwhen it's all about the fighting\nand no longer about the growth.\nWhen you notice that your fights\nare getting more frequent and intense,\ninvolving toxic relationship traits,\nsuch as the use of negative terms,\nphysical abuse, and manipulation,\nthen it might be best\nto ask for outside help and intervention.\nNumber five.\nYou can't open up to them about anything.\nYour partner is your other\nhalf and your support person.\nIt's only fitting\nthat you feel comfortable\naround them enough\nto talk about diverse topics,\nboth serious and lighthearted.\nIf your partner constantly cuts you off,\ndoesn't validate your own opinions,\nand spends most of the time\ntalking about themselves,\nthey may just be looking\nfor someone to talk to.\nIt's best to clear out\nany misunderstandings\nin the relationship beforehand.\nDo they just want someone to vent to?\nAre they irritated when\nyou talk about yourself?\nIf your partner does these things\nout of narcissistic tendencies,\nthen they really may not be for you.\nNumber six.\nYou're very defensive\nwhen asked about them.\nSomehow, your friends often seem to know\nwhen things are going\nsouth in a relationship.\nThis is because they care about you a lot.\nThey tend to ask questions and\nobserve you and your partner\nwhen you are together.\nDo you often feel the need\nto defend your partner\neven though no suspicious\nquestions are being asked?\nIt probably stems from how\nyou perceive your partner\nbased on their own actions.\nWhat are you defensive of?\nIs that their attitude?\nHave they done something\nyou don't want to tell your friends?\nIt might be a good idea to\nask yourself these questions\nand why you don't like being\nasked about your partner\nin the first place.\nIf there really is an issue,\nyou might want to talk\nabout this with your partner\nto address the main\nproblems in the first place.\nNumber seven.\nYou're afraid to let them meet\nthe people you're close to.\nAre you postponing your partner\nmeeting your friends or family?\nWhy do you think so?\nIt might be because you already know\nthey're not going to hit it off well.\nThe people close to you know you well,\nsometimes even better\nthan you know yourself.\nThe fact that you're avoiding\nthe inevitable meetup\nshows that you think\nthere is something wrong\nin your own relationship.\nIt might be a good idea to ask yourself\nabout the reasons for this\nfear in the first place.\nIs it because of how your partner behaves?\nDo you think their personality clashes\nwith the people that you're close to?\nHave they done something your\nfamily will not approve of?\nIt's encouraged to talk to\nyour partner about these things\nfor their own awareness too.\nAfter all, not all people\nwill get along at first.\nHowever, most of the time,\nthe people you're close to\nonly want the best for you.\nSo if you think they'll\nhave a negative impression\nof your relationship partner,\nthey're really might be something wrong.\nNumber eight.\nYou're constantly on the\nlookout for new partners.\nAre you often asking yourself\nif they're the right person for you?\nDo you repetitively imagine yourself\nbeing together with other people,\nasking yourself if it\nwould be a better match?\nIf you're always thinking\nabout other people\nor looking at others during\ndates with your partner,\nthat might be a sign that\nyou're not as invested\nin the relationship as you think you are.\nAttraction to other people is normal.\nIt's just an act of noticing\ngood traits in others.\nBut when you decide to act\non those harmless feelings,\nit's where things go awry.\nYou may feel this way\ndue to a lack of excitement\nin your relationship.\nIt might also be a method of escape\nfrom a restrictive relationship\nor a way of seeking comfort from others\nbecause of bad communication habits\nin your own relationship.\nWhatever the reason is, it's\nimportant to ask yourself\nwhy you're doing this in the first place.\nAre you unsatisfied?\nDoes the thought of breaking\nup with them frequently\ncome to your head?\nIt's encouraged to discuss\nthese points with your partner\nto come across a mutual understanding\nand conclusion together.\nNumber nine.\nYou don't feel like you're\nbecoming a better person.\nHave you reached a point\nin the relationship\nwhere you've become stagnant?\nAre you no longer\ninterested in your hobbies?\nDoes it feel like you are not improving?\nCollective growth is\nimportant in a relationship.\nYour partner inspires\nyou to be a better person\nand vice versa.\nHowever, if you both reach a standstill\nwhere you feel unmotivated\nby each other's presence\nand instead feel tired and weary,\nit might be better to take a step back\nand give space where it's needed.\nA lot of this is caused\nwhen the relationship becomes a routine,\ninstead of something exciting\nwith your other half.\nIf you're starting to\nfeel like it's a task\nrather than an expression of love,\nthen it might work to find other ways\nto get yourselves engaged in\nthe relationship once again.\nDon't put too much pressure on yourself.\nSometimes, breaking up with them\nis the breath of fresh air\nyou might actually need.\nAnd number 10.\nYou're staying in the\nrelationship out of comfort.\nHas it become a habit to\nstay in the relationship\njust for the sake of it?\nAre you afraid of the\nthought of being alone\nif you break up with them?\nIf you think the relationship\nhas reached its end\nand there's no possible way\nfor it to go anywhere else,\nit might be best to end it properly.\nIt's nice to keep in mind\nthat not all endings have to be bad.\nSometimes you just have to\ndo it and let life move on.\nIt may help to acknowledge\nthat you've done all that you can,\nand that is what is important.\nSometimes, letting go is better\nthan holding onto something\nthat no longer brings you joy or growth.\nIt's good to continuously ask\nyourself, are you still happy?\nIt sucks being in a relationship\nwith someone who you\nfeel isn't right for you.\nDo you have someone\nlike this in your life?\nWhat made you say so?\nPlease share your experiences\nin
