    "transcript": "during the first couple of dates and the\ntime between these meetups the days seem\nto rush by in a blur of passion and\nexcitement\nwe're so caught up in the thrill of\nmeeting someone new that we can't even\nstep back and process what's going on\nalthough we might feel lost in this\nwhirlwind of emotions\nour relationships usually stick to a\npretty common formula\nhere are a few stages that almost all\nrelationships will follow\nthe first stage\nattraction our relationships first begin\nwhen we set eyes on our new partner\nalthough we haven't started dating yet\nwe feel an undeniable pull towards this\nenchanting new person\nat this point you might walk up and\nintroduce yourself who knows you might\neven start flirting dropping a\ncompliment here and there\nand in 2019 this initial stage might not\neven take place in person\nmany people meet someone new on social\nmedia or through a dating app\nthe second stage learning more about\nthem\nonce we're attracted to someone we\nusually feel a desire to learn more\nabout them\nsometimes we discover more about this\nperson through conversation and\nsometimes we learn more about them after\nchecking out their social media profiles\nbetter yet we might even ask mutual\nfriends for more juicy details about\nthis new person\nall of this new information helps us\ndecide whether or not they're a good fit\nthe third stage\nbuilding comfort and trust\nin an article published by oxford's\ndepartment of experimental psychology\ncomfort and trust was identified as a\nmajor stage in all relationships\nthis is when both partners start to let\ntheir guards down testing the waters to\nsee if the relationship might be stable\nand sustainable in the future\nduring this stage it helps if partners\nare honest non-violent and forgiving\ninterestingly\noxford researchers stated that physical\ntouch is incredibly effective when it\ncomes to building trust\nthe fourth stage\nactually going on dates\nat this point we go on days regularly in\nprevious stages we might have been a\nlittle unsure about our partners but now\nwe've settled into a comfortable rhythm\nof dating and consistently enjoying each\nother's company\nas we date more and more both partners\nbuild a stronger connection based on\nmutual interests trust and attraction\nby the end of this stage we're\ncomfortable with being vulnerable around\nthem\nthe fifth stage\nseduction\naccording to that same oxford study\nseduction is one of the final stages of\na relationship\nthis is where we truly open ourselves to\nthe possibility of passionate intimacy\naccording to oxford researchers women\nneed more time to develop this emotional\nconnection when compared to men\nwhen we reach this stage we stop\nthinking of ourselves as singular beings\ninstead we start to become one with our\npartners\nwe feel their emotions and understand\ntheir experiences on a deeper level as\nif they were our own\nthe sixth stage\nthe honeymoon phase\nmost of our viewers are probably\nfamiliar with this phase of a\nrelationship\nin the first six months or so everything\nseems new in a relationship and this\ncould be explained by scientific studies\nresearchers tested nerve growth factors\nand cortisol levels of couples within\nthe first few months of a relationship\nthese levels were very high resulting in\nfeelings of euphoria and reduced stress\nbut when they tested those same levels\n12 to 24 months later the levels had\nreturned to normal\nthis suggests that relationships are\nonly truly tested after the honeymoon\nstage is over and the physiological love\ncocktail has worn off\nthe seventh stage\nthe doubting phase\nthis is the make or break stage for\nrelationships\ndoubts usually start to creep in after a\nfew years and making it this far is a\nreal accomplishment but the biggest\nhurdle is yet to come\nyou need to overcome all of these doubts\nif you want the relationship to succeed\npartners might start worrying about the\nunknown future their individual career\npaths and interests and whether or not\ntheir partner fits into all of this\nif it's not meant to be it'll become\nobvious during this stage\nin this current age of social media it's\nvery easy to start comparing our own\nrelationships to other perfect couples\nwe see online\nthis makes the stage of doubts even\ntougher to get through in 2019\nthe eighth stage\ncommitment and stability\nonce you reach this stage you're home\nfree\nafter many many years you're completely\nand unconditionally in love with each\nother\nyou know each other better than any\nother person on earth and you regularly\nfind yourself predicting each other's\nactions and knowing what to say to\ncomfort your partner during stressful\ntimes\nmost importantly you don't take each\nother for granted\nyou're happy with the direction of the\nrelationship and you might even start\nbuilding projects and creating things\ntogether who knows\nmaybe your family\nlet us know if you agree with our eight\nstages of dating if you've left anything\nout be sure to let us know in the\ncomments
