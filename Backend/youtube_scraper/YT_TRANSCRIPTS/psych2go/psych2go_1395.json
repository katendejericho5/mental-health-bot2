    "transcript": "hey psych2goers welcome back to another\nvideo let's begin\nall mbti personality types have a host\nof pleasant traits and strengths\nbut they carry with them some weaknesses\nand negative traits too\nand in these dark tendencies there can\nbe latent psychopathic urges that may\nemerge out of circumstance\ndr prakash masand a psychiatrist and\nfounder of the centers of psychiatric\nexcellence noted certain traits as\ncommonly shared among people with\npsychopathic tendencies\nthese include social irresponsibility or\nviolating the rights of others\nthey also include an inability to\ndistinguish between right and wrong\nand showing a general disregard towards\nsafety and responsibility\nbefore we begin we want to remind you\nthat the mbti is a personality\ninventory designed to roughly identify a\nperson's personality type\nsplit into 16 categories as such it is a\nlist of rough tendencies rather than\nstrict classifications\nalso this is not made to attack anyone\nor any personality type who may display\nthese signs or anyone diagnosed with\npsychopathy\nbut rather to understand them and bring\nmore awareness to the topic\nwith that said let's get started let's\nbegin with the introvert spectrum of the\nmbti\nnumber one istp as an isdp there are a\nlot of things that you enjoy that don't\nactively involve people\nyou may even find as if people get in\nthe way of your goals\nas such these antisocial tendencies make\nistp\nlikely candidates to have psychopathic\ntendencies\nnumber two infj as an infj\nyou are a natural in getting to the root\nof people's hearts moving them with your\nwords and mannerisms\nwhile many infjs come from a perspective\nof empathy and goodness towards others\nmore than a few can have harmful ideals\nand distorted intentions that are potent\nin influencing a group of people\nnumber three isfj isfjs are one of the\ntypes who are very unlikely to be\npsychopaths\nthey are nurturing loyal and caring the\nonly time when a psychopathic tendency\nmay emerge from an isfj\nis when you get too controlling or\npossessive over your partner\nrelying on manipulation to get your way\nnumber four\nisfp are you impulsive and desire\nfreedom\nyou may not be the best planners or\nstrategists but you are physical thrill\nseekers that care little about risk\nwhoa there you are very easily able to\ntry out the road less traveled\nand may even cause harm to others while\nyou're at it number 5.\nintj think of a villain at the top of a\nhigh-rise skyscraper\nand all the floors below filled with\ngoons and traps with the explicit\nperfect of disadvantaging you and making\nyour way to the top\nthat villain the intj intjs are more\nthan likely to be schemers\nplotters and convincing overseers with\ntheir penchant for strategy\nand low incidence of emotions a main in\ntheir function stack\nalso they have no problem letting others\ndo the dirty work for them\nthink minions but they sure are cute\nthough number six\nistj istjs may not be the mafia boss\nbut they're the essential troublemakers\nthat get the dirty work done with their\nability to do routine yet crucial\nmentally challenging tasks your cold and\ndetached demeanor\nmake you prone to have psychopathic\ntendencies or at least be swayed to\nreveal it if an influential force\npersuades you to the dark side number 7\ninfp it's hard to imagine an infp as the\nstereotypical psychopath\nthey're just too kind-hearted and\nsensitive to take up the role of harming\nothers\nbut if or when they do end up in the\npsychopath business\nthey'd probably do it for a cause that\nis for a common good\nor for a value that's driven on justice\nor ideals\nyeah it's still admittedly hard to wrap\nyour head around\nnumber eight intp they are\ncold logisticians and great rationalists\nthat have varying degrees of sociability\ndepending on who you're talking to\nyou're open-minded and take into account\nall possibilities\nand there's always an underlying logical\nreason for what you do\nand since your feelings rarely if ever\ntop the stacks\nyou can at whim choose to uphold logic\nover empathy\nwhich is to say promoting psychopathic\ntendencies to an extent\nin the process okay okay you've all been\nwaiting\nso without further ado let's examine\nsome extrovert personalities and their\npsychopathic tendencies\nnumber nine entj natural planners\nand a commanding presence that can be\nfelt in a crowd an entj's ambition and\npower-hungry tendencies allow you to\nnaturally take up\nmajor roles which is something you love\nwith this desire to lead\nan unhealthy entj can easily forego the\nrights of others in favor of the end\nresult\ngetting things done their way selfishly\nfor their goal\nnumber 10 enfp a free spirited\nindividual\npeople can sort of pinpoint what energy\nan enfp\nexudes since your mannerisms are open\ngestures and\nindicative tone shifts this can make it\nharder for enfps to possess\npsychopathic tendencies as most of the\ndark energy you harbor is mostly\nfeelings within yourself rather than\nsomething that is imposed on others\nso number 11 esfp free spirited and\npresent focused an esfp loves the thrill\nof action and can have little regard\ntowards others if you don't find it fun\nor gratifying at the present moment\nthis self-servicing attitude can be\nrooted in a greedy desire for fun\nwhich can justify selfish and\npotentially psychopathic actions\nnumber 12. estj a\ncold businessman or bossy authority head\nthat only thinks of driving revenue to\nthe bottom line\nthey know how to capitalize on people's\nskills and have a penchant for bossing\nothers to act\nand for the most stereotypically fitting\ntypes they do it in an almost\ndictatorial fashion with no regard for\nothers\nvery possible psychopaths number 13\nenfj charisma personified\nyou are capable of adapting your\npersonality with your conversation\npartner\nnot all enfjs are psychopaths however\nbut the inborn charisma and ability to\nsway a crowd is a powerful tool\nthat can easily hide a sinister\nintention behind it\nnumber 14 entp often detached people\nseeing the world through the lens of\nlogic and possibilities\nyou are fond of challenging the\nrealities and ideas without much\nconsideration for personal values\nand more so for the fun of it this makes\nthe empathy threshold lower than most\ntypes\nmaking it very possible to harbor\npsychopathic tendencies\nnumber 15. estp reckless\nand impulsive with no regard for others\nesdps are likely candidates to have\npsychopathic tendencies as well\nyou see things based on the results and\nthe impact something has on others\nmany authoritarian bosses fall under\nthis category too\nand number 16 esfj warm and\ncompassionate\nthe esfj on the surface may outwardly\nexhibit non-psychopathic traits\nbut just like the enfjs you have a\ncharisma and charm about you that can\ndraw in a crowd\nonly without the ability to sustain a\nlong-term calculated plan\nthus you're not the likeliest candidate\nto be psychopathic\nyou are unique and encompass a multitude\nof traits\nhowever having traits that may lead to\npsychopathy does not mean you're sure to\nembark on that road\nthrough these mbti classifications you\nonly see the multitude of\ncharacteristics and what they mean\nthey're in no way a predictor for a\nconfirmed human behavior\nso if you harbor traits regarded as\npsychopathic by the mbti\nplease do not consider it prophesizing\nit describes the trait\nnot who you are but if you feel\nincreasingly resonant with such traits\nconsulting a professional is always a\ngood idea\ndoes your type have
