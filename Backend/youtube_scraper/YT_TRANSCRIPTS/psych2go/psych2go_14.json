Sat Sri Akal.\nBeing destructively forced\ninto that philosophy. Khan.\nNobody likes to be suppressed.\nNobody wants to be told they're evil.\nA common complaint we saw is\nthat religious people can\nbe judgmental hateful,\nand aggressive with their beliefs.\nRather than making people want to repent\nand join the religion, it\njust pushes them away from it.\nIf they're a part of the\nreligion, a lot to lose\nby being judged and cast out.\nThey lose a lot of the things that would\notherwise benefit their\nmental health as a community.\nBeing excluded, judged,\nand ostracized can be\npainful and distressing.\nFor the people who go through\nit, it can be difficult\nto trust members of those religions.\nIt took almost everything away from me.\nI had to build myself up from the ground.\nI hadn't seen my family members in years.\nMy mother cries herself to sleep,\nand my father stresses himself to death.\nAll over me coming out in a simple,\nvery tame Baptist community.\neven a crazy cult or anything.\nI see it hurt, ruin, and kill\npeople like me every day.\nTurning brother against\nbrother, father against child.\nI'm glad for the good it\ndoes to those who cherish it,\nbut there will never be\na day that I turn back\nto the hell that was church.\nThe religion itself isn't\nbad, but the institution is.\nUse to inspire.\nPro, religion should teach\nus how to navigate our lives.\nIf you believe in a God who\nloves you unconditionally,\nor a practice of faith that\nguides you, I can encourage you\nand make you feel like you\ncan always improve as a person\nor handle anything that comes your way.\nWith a religion,\nyou might feel a little\nless afraid of life.\nGoing back to my Catholic\nfaith in my twenties\nand living it to the fullest has totally\ntransformed my life.\nLess depressed, more resiliency,\na brighter outlook on life,\nand purpose that animates my daily living.\nIt helped me develop better friendships\nand relationships too.\nIf I hadn't read the Bible\nand realized what is right, I\ncan tell you here right now,\nI would have ended up long ago.\nBut, thank God for keeping\nme through hard times.\nI feel like God gives me purpose\nto be the best person I can be.\nUse to justify bad behavior. Con.\nThis is an extremely common\ncriticism of religion,\nand it is an understandable one.\nEach religion is debated by scholars,\nbelievers, and institutions.\nImportance is given more to\nsome aspects than others.\nThe religious texts have\nbecome guides on what\nto criticize about others rather than how\nto best live your own life.\nIn psychology, we see this\nreflected to how people react\nto good and bad behavior.\nInstead of criticizing people\nwho misinterpret the religion\nwith negative behavior, other members\nof the religion are more likely\nto excuse the negative behavior.\nBoth. I used to hold a lot\nof anger towards religion.\nThen, as I got older\nand researched more religions,\nI found my anger wasn't at\nthe religion or belief itself,\nbut the misguided people\nwho practice their selfish\nor simple-minded versions\nof the teachings.\nIt's helped me form a belief\nthat actually feels genuine to me now.\nThose were before I would\nsay it felt of lost.\nI recently halfway\n- Left Christianity.\nI became an agnostic atheist.\nI started losing faith.\nI don't really know why.\nIt didn't feel right.\nThough I respect all religions,\nI hate it when people use\nreligion as an excuse.\nFor example, an excuse for homophobia.\nProvides answers and community. Pro.\nFor many, religion holds\nthe answers to some\nof the most difficult questions.\nIt tells us we're here for a reason.\nWe go on when we die and\nthat we'll always be loved.\nOn top of all of that, people\nwho practice their\nreligion have a community\nto encourage them.\nThis can be extremely cathartic\nand diffuse a lot of\nmental health problems.\nThis is why psychotherapy also accounts\nfor religion and treatment.\nIt offers comfort to our\nexistential concerns.\nIt has made me believe\nmore in hope and peace.\nI'm a Buddhist.\nBuddhist philosophy really\nhelped in helping me in every\naspect of my life.\nMy parents failed to give me\nthe love I deserve as a child.\nI always see Buddha as a noble\nand important figure in my life.\nBuddhism taught me the\nway of loving my own self.\nAnd a lot more. There's no\njudgement. Only love and wisdom.\nGood, I think.\nI was part of different Christian\ngroups when I was younger\nbecause one of my best\nfriends were religious.\nNever believed myself but it\nwas nice in a community way.\nWent later to a private very\nChristian boarding school\nand that was positive too.\nI'm gay but it wasn't an issue.\nMy country is very progressive like that.\nNo to openly buy priests.\nOnly issue with me personally being gay\nand religion has come from\nsome Muslim friends of mine.\nNot to say Christians better.\nStill no gay or bi people\nthat's been thrown out\nor beaten by their Christian parents.\nReligions are probably\ncomforting to many people\nand giving them meaning and guidance.\nReligious guilt. Con.\nUsually when we speak about\nreligious guilt the guilt comes\nfrom feeling like we are horrible people.\nNowadays with the way\nreligions are spread there are\ndifferences in how we see our religion\nand how the leading institutions\nor other believers represent our religion.\nIn that way, there can be guilt\nor shame for being\nassociated with the people\nwho we feel represent us poorly.\nReligious people as a\nwhole are not more prone\nto shame than anyone else.\nIn some ways being religious\ncan shield you from shame\nbut guilt is different.\nReligious people were found\nto be more prone to guilt.\nThis can spiral into religious OCD\nwhere it feels like\neverything you do is wrong.\nFear of punishment can drive\na person to live in fear.\nI have religious OCD,\ndiagnosed by a professional.\nI like Christianity and Jesus and God\nbut I just wish it could\nbe normal about it.\nInstead of picking at my\nskin and hating myself\nand living in guilt.\nAlthough the therapy and\nmedication do help a lot.\nIt's not the sacred texts\nthat promote this in me.\nNor have I been abused\nby the church in any way.\nWell, maybe mentally but\nlet's not go into it.\nIt's me taking apart scripture\nand thinking about damnation\ninstead of the good.\nThinking I'm not good enough\nand that I'm irredeemable and guilty.\nAnd policing every wish and every mistake.\nThat's how different\npeople perceive religion\nis what gets me.\nI'm a Baptist but I haven't\nbeen to church in a while.\nOther Christians I know\ncan have drastically\ndifferent views to me.\nAnd some people outside\nChristianity see us all\nwith a bad rep from how\nthey've experienced it.\nMy first ever girlfriend gave\nme an ultimatum two weeks into\nmy relationship with her.\nI'd either have to join\nher religious group\nor we would have to break up\nsince they don't allow marriage\nto people outside the faith.\nThankfully I'm much happier\nnow with a girlfriend\nwho values me for me.\nBut late 2022\nand early 2023 were so awful for me\nthat I genuinely felt every\nterrible emotion all at once.\nI was being gaslit by her\ninto thinking it was my fault\nfor feeling this way as well.\nI'm so glad to be done with a religion.\nI'm glad to finally be valued\nfor who I am as a person not\nas someone that agrees\non an unsubstantiated\nspiritual claim.\nOverall, perceptions of religion vary.\nYour experiences can sway into\nloving or hating a religion\nor all religions.\nThe best thing you can do\nis decide for yourself.\nThose who have chosen their religion\nand adamantly believe in it reap the\nbenefits from it the most.\nWhen religion is most\ndestructive to mental health,\nit is usually because\nof overzealous behavior,\nforcing views on others\nand using the religion to justify hate.\nSo is religion more good than\nbad for your mental health?\nThat isn't for us to say.\nWhether religion broke you, saved you,\nor you just feel conflicted about it,\nthat journey is up to you.\nYour opinion and beliefs might change\nbut it couldn't hurt to be aware\nof the potential mental pitfalls\nand ladders that can come with religion.\nThank you to everyone who\ncommented so respectfully\nand thoughtfully in the community post.\nLet's keep the conversation\ngoing in the comments below.\nIf you enjoyed this\nvideo, please leave a like\nand subscribe to Psych2Go\nfor more videos like this."
