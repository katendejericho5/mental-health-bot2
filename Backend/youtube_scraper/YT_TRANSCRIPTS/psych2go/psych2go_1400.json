    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nAre you hoping to increase\nyour intelligence?\nMaybe you need a few tips.\nOr perhaps you're curious\nas to what common traits\nintelligent people seem to have.\nWell, you clicked the\nright video, my friend,\nbecause today Psych2Go presents to you\n\"6 Traits of Highly Intelligent People.\"\nHow many do you have?\nOne, they're curious about everything.\nCuriosity didn't kill\nthe cat in this case.\nIt simply made him smarter.\nAccording to a research study from 2016\npublished in the \"Journal\nof Individual Differences,\"\nthere is a connection to\nbeing open to new experiences\nand childhood intelligence.\nThe researchers conducted the study\nwith thousands of participants\nin the UK for 50 years.\n11-year-olds who had\nscored high on an IQ test\nended up being much more open\nto new experiences at age 50.\nSo if you're burning with\ncuriosity for the world,\nit's never to late to learn\nand try something new.\nGet exploring.\nTwo, they can adapt well.\nHow well can you adapt to new situations?\nSeveral Quora users noted\nthat intelligent people are flexible\nand able to thrive in different settings.\nAs Donna F. Hammett writes,\nintelligent people adapt\nby showing what can be done\nregardless of the complications\nor restrictions placed upon them.\nRobert J. Sternberg, a\nprofessor of psychology\nand dean of the School\nof Arts and Sciences\nat Tufts University,\nwrites in the Encyclopedia Britannica\nthat psychologists have generally agreed\nthat adaptation to the environment\nis the key to understanding\nboth what intelligence is\nand what it does.\nSternberg explains\nthat, for the most part,\nadaptation involves\nmaking a change in oneself\nin order to cope more\neffectively with the environment.\nBut it can also mean\nchanging the environment,\nor finding an entirely new one.\nThree, they're empathetic.\nAre you an empath?\nWell, empathy is a smart trait to have.\nIntelligent individuals\nlook to understand others\nand help them.\nThis can be helpful for both parties,\nand helps to avoid conflict.\nThey don't wish to escalate the conflict,\nbut look for a resolution.\nEmpathy can certainly help in this case\nas you're trying to understand others.\nHighly intelligent people\nare also emotionally intelligent,\nwhich means they can handle emotions well.\nThey do this by recognizing\nwhat they're feeling\nand understanding their emotions\nto the best of their ability.\nFour, they realize they\ndon't know everything.\nSmart people realize they\ndon't know everything\nand have much to learn.\nThey won't try to fake\nhow much they know about a topic,\nand instead, look to\nlearn more from others.\nThey want to learn more,\nso they have to be open to new ideas\nand other perspectives.\nInstead of believing they\nhave all the answers,\nthey approach new topics\nwith an open mind.\nAccording to research by Justin\nKruger and David Dunning,\npublished in the \"Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology,\"\nintelligent people may underestimate\nhow many answers they\nget correct on a test,\nwhile less intelligent individuals\noverestimate their correct answers.\nThe study states, across four studies,\nthe authors found that\nparticipants scoring\nin the bottom quartile on tests\nof humor, grammar, and logic,\ngrossly overestimated their\ntest performance and ability.\nAlthough their test scores put\nthem in the 12th percentile,\nthey estimated themselves\nto be in the 62nd.\nSeveral analyses linked\nthis miscalibration\nto deficits in metacognitive skill,\nor the capacity to distinguish\naccuracy from error.\nFive, they know who they are.\nKnowing who you are and\nwhat you want in life\ncan have its benefits.\nIntelligent people are\nnot only self-aware,\nbut they have a good\nunderstanding of who they are\nand who they want to become.\nThey live by their values\nand pursue their goals.\nThis will help them grow,\nbut also give them a\ngreat deal of confidence\nthat will aid them in life.\nMore confidence in their skills and self\nalso helps them make decisions easier.\nSo who are you?\nWho do you want to become?\nIt's time to find out.\nSix, they continue to learn.\nAre you constantly seeking\nto learn something new?\nWell, that's very smart of you.\nIntelligent people are curious.\nThey have a strong desire\nto learn more about this world.\nThey're not afraid to ask questions\nand create their own hypotheses, too.\nThey also love to learn new skills,\nand they can spend hours reading.\nWho doesn't wanna learn something new\nabout this great world?\nSo do you relate to any of these points?\nShare with us in the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nIf you did, don't forget\nto click the Like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd, as always, thanks for watching."
