guys\n[Music]\nso\n[Music]\ni'll start with chapter one\nand i'm not going to read the whole\nthing but\ni'll start with a little paragraph here\n[Music]\nyou had a 1 in 400 trillion chances of\nbeing conceived\nbut here you are\nhave you ever wondered how amazing it\ntruly is that you're alive right now\ndo you know that your existence is a\nmiracle\nlet me remind you what happened from\nthere you were inside another human's\nwomb for nine months\nwhere you magically grew a heart\nhands feet\nmouth\nand eyes from essentially nothing\n[Music]\nthen you decided that it was time for\nyou to be born so you detached from the\nwomb\ncalled home for all those months\nyou just innately knew even though you\ndidn't know how to walk talk\nrun or anything yet\nyou just knew when it was time to come\nout to the world and started breathing\ndon't you say you're a miracle\n[Music]\nso that is the beginning of the chapter\ni remember reading this somewhere that\nyou know there's such a small chance\nthat we should have been conceived at\nall\nthat\nwe\nliterally were a miracle just to be\nalive\none in\n400 trillion chances\nand here you are\nwhat are the chances that all of you\nguys are here right now sharing this\nmoment across the world i mean that's a\nmiracle\nthis moment is a miracle so\nso that's how it starts\nnow um the next one i wanted to read is\nactually uh from\nchapter 17.\nwhen you think about this idea of being\nnormal\nwhat comes up for you\nwhat does it mean for you to be normal\nso\nan extrovert boring accepted like\neveryone else happy with no anxiety\nyou don't know great great\nthat's all great\ni think normal is an illusion right it's\nnot an actual concept of any sort so i'm\ngoing to read you guys a poem here and\nif you've ever felt in your life\nthat you're not normal or that you don't\nknow what normal is you don't know how\nto be normal this poem is for you\n[Music]\nare you willing to die from the illusion\nof reality before you die from your\nphysical body\nare you willing to let go of the\nillusion of reality that you and i are\nseparate\nare you willing to see that a life\nwithout suffering is not the same as a\nlife free of pain or pleasure\nbut rather letting go of the resistance\nfrom pain and pleasure\nin all experiences in between\nand when you let go of the resistance\nwhat's left\nwho's left\nwho are you really\nare you willing to be so courageous to\nlet that truth of you shine and lead the\npath\nwhat does your soul authentically want\nto express when you tune into that truth\nof yours that shines so bright\ncan you be inspired not stay scared of\nthat truth\nand i'm gonna read a little bit of this\nchapter here\nso this is um if you guys are just\njoining this is my first book it's\ncalled creating your own happiness\nand this is chapter 17 so we're talking\nabout freeing yourself from this\nillusion of being normal\nwhat does it mean to you to be normal\nwhy did you choose to go to college if\nyou did why did you study for the sats\nif you did\nwhy did you get your first job if you\ndid\ndo you know\ni asked these\num i asked because these are things that\ni grew up thinking was the only way to\nbe\nnormal and i didn't even know why i\nnever questioned my definition of normal\nfor a while\ni once met jose a 17 year old who had\nalready published 12 books about social\nmedia marketing and had his own agency\nby the age of 17.\nhe lived in puerto rico and was already\nable to hack the internet business world\nat the age of 17.\nwhen i was 17 years old i was in high\nschool studying for the sats trying to\nfigure out which college to go to\nbecause i thought that was the only way\nto live life\ni wasn't even thinking about what kind\nof impact i truly wanted to have in the\nworld or what i want to do with my\ncollege degree to fulfill my purpose in\nlife\ni didn't know i was supposed to discover\nmy life purpose in high school or\ncollege\ni followed this prescribed path of\ncollege job and retire\nthen after college i got a corporate job\ni didn't really know why i just thought\neveryone did\nit was what my parents told me would be\nthe best for me\ni considered it to be normal especially\ncoming from korea\nso i followed the norm because the\nthought that i could do something\ndifferent didn't even cross my mind\nthen i started seeing some friends\ntaking very different routes from what i\nthought was possible\none friend was a videographer creating\namazing commercials and videos and\ntraveling the world\nanother was a youtube influencer\nanother was a speaker and an author\nthe frequency of these stories showing\nup in my life from my closer connection\nstarted to increase as if the universe's\nmessage to me was getting louder and\nlouder\nthen one day\nit hit me like a brick wall\ni love writing i love creating and i\nlove helping people to think of new\npossibilities\nwhat am i doing at this corporate sales\njob where i'm not doing any of those\nthings that light up my soul\nso then i decided to quit and i decided\nto accept the universe's invitation to\nstep into my power\nwe always have the choice and the power\nto decide whether we want to follow our\nintuition or purpose versus chase the\nexternal ideals of being normal\nwe have the power to create our own\nrules and free ourselves from any\nbeliefs that keep us small and trapped\nby owning that we're responsible for any\ndecision in life and that we have\ninfinite power to create whatever path\nwe desire we start to feel empowered\nknowing we can truly achieve freedom\nfrom whatever we think is trying to keep\nus caged\nit is up to us to let that happen or not\nit is up to you to play bigger and\noutside of the cage of quote unquote\nnormal\ni choose freedom over and over again\nover focusing on trying to fit into a\nsocietal cage now\nthis freedom offers me so much joy and\nadventure and zest for life knowing that\ni'm creating my own reality\nyes so what did you guys think about\nthat what are your thoughts on\nbeing normal\nand if you don't feel normal\ncan we celebrate you\ni'm going to catch up in some of the\nchats here\n[Music]\n[Music]\nsuch thing as normal because we're all\ndifferent if you don't feel normal that\nmeans you're just unique yes\nyes yes yes\nnormal is not having panic attacks every\nday\nwell\ni wonder who you're gonna become by\novercoming that challenge for you\nand that you're gonna be very unique\nso i'm glad that's resonating with you\nguys and i'm honestly having a moment\nright now because\nthis is my dream\nthis is my dream come true to be honest\num i never thought and by the way you\nguys if there's a dream of yours that\nfeels so freaking distant\nrealize that there was a time in my life\nif you would have told me that i would\nbe\nin front of\nyou know eight million people\npotentially reading my book that i wrote\nin this particular lifetime i would have\nsaid that's crazy that would never\nhappen\nand in just a few years i was able to\nreally steer my own ship towards the\ndirection that i want\nand\nhere i am\ncreating this moment with you guys right\nnow so this means the world i'm so\ngrateful that i get to share this with\nyou guys\ni get to have this moment with you guys\nfrom all over the world it's actually\nreally incredible\nso um before i go on to the next one\nyes i wrote this thick book i did\nand i actually had to cut down a lot of\num chapters from it because it wasn't\ngetting a lot\nso\nyeah being normal is kind of lame to be\nhonest i agree with you\nbeing normal is boring\ni totally agree\nso um share with me\nwhat's resonating with you\nhow will you choose to be unique this\nyear\nnormal is mundane yeah\nand if there's something about you\nthat you thought was abnormal about you\nuntil now\ncan you start to look at that in a\nreally\nyou know powerful way like that's\nsomething that makes you different\nif you're having thoughts that is\ndifferent from all the other people\nthat's a superpower\ni mean there's elon musk who wants to go\nto mars\ni mean that seems pretty abnormal right\nhowever because he thinks that\nyou know\nhe's making it happen by the way i\nbelieve he also has um\neither uh\nautism or asperger's as well so some of\nthe smartest people in the world are\nabnormal or some of the richest people\nin the world are abnormal that's why\nthey're so unique and powerful\n[Music]\nso yes\nokay you guys\ni'm going to read one of my favorite\npoems that i've ever written\nthis is about\nlove\nthis is about love this is about\nemotions\nso\n[Music]\nironically this book which is about\ncreating your own happiness is not just\nabout being happy it actually gives you\nthe permission to feel\nwhatever you feel\nknowing that anything that you feel is\nactually okay\nit's a guide as a teacher for you\nso i'm going to read this poem and\nhopefully it'll resonate with you guys\nand start to make sense as i read this\nand\num you start to understand\nthe meaning of emotions and love here\nokay you guys\nready here's the thing\neverything is made of love\neverything\nevery emotion is a shade of love\nthe opposite of love isn't fear\nfear is a shade of love\nfor if you didn't love something you\nwouldn't fear losing it\nthe opposite of love\nisn't anger\nanger is a shade of love\nfor if you didn't love you wouldn't get\nangry enough to protect it\nthe opposite of love isn't\ndisappointment\ndisappointment is a shade of love\nfor if you didn't love you wouldn't put\nan exciting expectation on it\nthe opposite of love isn't jealousy or\nenvy\nfor if you didn't love you wouldn't envy\nenough to want what they have\nthe opposite of love\nisn't hatred for if you didn't love we\nwouldn't hate how far we've strayed away\nfrom our true potential our true ideals\nof love\nthe only true opposite of love is lack\nof participation in this universe\nbecause when you're not here\nwhen you block out these shades of love\nand you disconnect and hide\nthen we can't see you\nwe can't experience any colors of love\nany colors of you\nso come play in this playground where\nall emotions are welcomed and you're\nallowed to get messy\nand here all expressions of you are\ncelebrated because you can't fool us\neven if you tried\nall colors of emotions are just\nreincarnations of love\nso don't be afraid\ni see you\nwhen you fearlessly paint the world with\nall different shades of love\nthat's how i know you're a child of god\nyour love is abundant in all your\nexpressions of who you are\nso be here\nbe with us\nwhen we color together when we get messy\ntogether\nwe're just painting this canvas this\nuniverse with more love\n[Music]\nit's like your instrument\nokay\nall right so you guys\noh so many beautiful discussions\nhappening about the word love i love\nthis\ni love that you guys love it\nah\n[Music]\ni'm just reading some of these comments\nhere\ni want to create my own story\nbeing able to live beyond the stars and\nwatching your own story unfold is\nsomething amazing until somebody rips\nyou down because you're doing something\nyou love\nwell\nthat seems like it's another challenge\nfor you to overcome\nyou know it's like a video game\nit wouldn't be fun if there weren't\nnothing that challenges you it's just\nanother challenge are you up for it\n[Music]\nah i never thought that was normal\n[Music]\nwell japanese okay\nlove is a shared identity\ninvest patience can be the opposite of\nenvy until you realize how much you like\nothers\nokay so no matter what if it's normal\nokay\nso yes thank you for your feedback i\nactually have a chat on slow-mo today so\ni'm trying to like actually read it\nbecause typically i'm like oh my gosh my\neyes hurt\num oh thank you mia thanks for listening\nto my posts and listening to my videos\nyou don't have to like challenges you\ndon't\nyou're allowed to do whatever you want\ni am on spotify yes\nstress around people any advice to\novercome this okay you get stressed\naround people well what is your\nmeaning about people is it because\nyou're afraid that they're judging you\nor what is it about being around people\nthat stresses you out\nand\njust because it stresses you out doesn't\nmean that\nit's abnormal just a thing\nand if you can actually accept that if\nyou can actually accept that wait maybe\nit's okay for me to be stressed out\naround people once in a while\nthen actually what might happen is your\nnervous system might actually start to\ncalm down\nyou get less stressed\num and as you guys know i think\ni work with actually stressed out\nentrepreneurs and high cheapers who are\nseeking you know that inner peace\nand freedom so\none of the things that i suggest and you\nguys know this if you've been on my live\nstream before one of the things i really\nwould like to suggest\nis uh\nto\nmeditate to meditate um even for like 10\nminutes a day it would allow your\nnervous system your body to actually\ncalm down\nand stress is actually a physiological\nresponse so it could really help you can\nemotional support animals help with\nanxiety you always wanted to be an\nentrepreneur great\nah thank you i love you too guys\ni appreciate y'alls\nokay should i read one more\ni'll read one more if you guys
