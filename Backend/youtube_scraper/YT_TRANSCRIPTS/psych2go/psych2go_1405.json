    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers.\nHave your parents ever told you\nthat you shouldn't do something,\nnot because it's actually bad,\nbut because it doesn't\nmake them look good?\nMany of the habits that you\nwere made to think are bad\ncan actually be good for\nyou for a number of reasons.\nBelieve it or not, everyone has\none or more of these habits,\neven if they don't show it in public.\nSo to help you identify\nsome of the good habits\nyou may be doing but are not aware of,\nhere are six habits that\nare actually good for you.\nNumber one, chewing gum.\nHave you ever been\nscolded for chewing gum?\nWhile it's true that chewing gum\ndoes not bring you any\nkind of nutritional benefit\nand may be disturbing\nfor others to listen to,\nchewing gum does help you focus\nand lower your stress levels.\nAccording to researchers\nat Cardiff University,\nchewing gum improves\nthe alertness of workers\nand reduced their stress.\nAdditionally, a study\nin the Journal Appetite\nfound that chewing gum also\nincreases your short-term\nand long-term memory.\nSo yeah, people might\nfind the sound annoying,\nand you might not look good\nconstantly chewing something,\nbut this habit does have its benefits.\nNumber two, letting gasses out.\nWhat do you think about letting gas out?\nDo you think it's disgusting\nor just a natural function of your body?\nIt's easy to see why people\nsay letting gas out is bad.\nAfter all, farts and burps smell bad.\nAnd there are people who,\nwhen letting them out,\ncan make very nasty sounds.\nHowever, letting gas out of your body\nis actually much more\nbeneficial than holding it in.\nThe body is known to release\ngas around 14 times a day.\nAnd this is one of the\nonly ways that your body\ncan get rid of the carbon\ndioxide and methane\nthat are produced in your digestive tract.\nKeeping gas in your body\ncan cause you to have\na splash of gastric acid into the gullet\nthat can lead to chest pain.\nSo don't try holding them in,\nsince it might actually harm you.\nNumber three, biting your nails.\nDo you often bite your nails?\nThis is a habit that most\npeople find is pleasing,\nmainly because of the fact\nthat your nails or hands\nare the most exposed part of your body.\nSo a lot of dirt and germs can\nget stuck under your nails.\nAlso, in some cases,\nbiting your nails can make a sound\nthat disturbs a lot of people around you.\nHowever, some doctors have\nactually supported the theory\nthat biting your nails and\nhaving this small scale exposure\ncan help you build your immunities\nand improve your health in the long run.\nSo this habit may not be all that bad.\nNumber four, skipping showers.\nDo you believe that you\nshould take showers every day,\neven when you don't get dirty?\nSkipping showers is\nperceived as a bad habit,\nand it can make you look\nlike someone who doesn't care\nabout their personal hygiene.\nHowever, it may not be that bad\nif you were just home all day\nand haven't done any activity\nthat might make you dirty.\nThis is because showering\nevery day with soap\ncan strip your hair and\nskin from its natural oils\ncausing dryness.\nEven if you don't use soap,\nhot water can destroy a lot of bacteria\nthat help your skin stay healthy.\nSo if you stay home all day\nand feel like you are clean,\nthen skipping a shower once in a while\nmay benefit your hair and skin.\nNumber five, sleeping in.\nDo your parents complain\nwhenever you sleep in?\nThe popular belief is\nthat sleeping in means\nthat you're a lazy person.\nSimilarly, they may think\nwaking earlier means\nyou're a more successful person.\nHowever, waking up when your\nbody tells you to wake up\nis actually healthier than\nforcing yourself to wake up early\nand not getting enough rest.\nGetting up according to\nyour circadian rhythms\ncan keep your metabolism up\nand avoid a lot of problems\nthat people who under sleep face,\nsuch as over eating junk food.\nSo it's better to give your body\nthe amount of sleep that it wants,\neven if it looks bad to other people.\nAnd number six, swearing.\nHave your parents taught\nyou not to swear ever?\nWell, swearing, according\nto etiquette rules,\nis deemed as rude and inappropriate,\nbut according to a study conducted in 2017\nand published in the journal\nSocial, Psychological,\nand Personality Science,\npeople who swear tend\nto have more integrity\nand are more honest.\nSwearing can also help you\nincrease your pain tolerance,\nrelieve stress and process\nnegative emotions better.\nThis doesn't mean you should swear\nas soon as you have the chance.\nInstead, you may just wanna\nstop suppressing this habit\njust because others might\nthink that you're rude\nsince it can actually\nbring a number of benefits\nfor your emotional health.\nDid you relate to any of\nthese habits we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand
