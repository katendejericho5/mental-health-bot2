    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nAre you having trouble in\nthe romance department?\nMaybe you're really into someone,\nbut can't tell if they're into you.\nOne minute it's a yes, but\nthen the next it's a nah.\nSo do they like you or not?\nWell, here are six signs\nthat they're not into you\nand just not telling you.\nNumber one, they aren't\nengaged in your conversations.\nTake a close look\nat their face next time\nyou're talking with them.\nNo, not just their dreamy eyes, stop it.\nNotice whether they're actually listening\nto what you're saying\nduring your dinner dates\nand if they're engaged\nin your conversation.\nAre they on their phone?\nAre they scanning around\nthe room, directionless?\nAre they looking at someone\nelse or something else?\nTheir pasta perhaps?\nWell, I would too if I\nwas eating good pasta,\nbut that's besides the point.\nIf they don't engage with you\noften on an emotional level\nor even any level during your outings,\nthen it looks like a nah\nin the relationship\ndepartment for you two.\nNumber two, they don't\ncommunicate or text consistently.\nDo they text you regularly?\nCheck your phone.\nGo ahead. I'm waiting.\nWhen's the last time they texted you?\nEight hours ago, eight\ndays or eight years?\nI'm just kidding on the years part,\nunless you're long lost friends,\nbut if they don't\ncommunicate with you often,\ntext or no text,\nit's a sign they don't\ncare enough about you\nto pursue a deeper relationship.\nThe only relationship they're in\nis the one with their pasta,\npasta puttanesca, (giggles) number three.\nYou're the only one always making plans.\nWho's making the plans\nin the relationship?\nWho's asking who out?\nWho's initiating the conversations\nabout availability, people?\nIf they're not putting the\neffort in to even ask you out,\nor at least hint at your availability,\nthey may not be into you.\nIf they've grown distant\nin asking you out,\nand you haven't seen any\neffort from them in going out\nand doing things with\nyou in the real world,\nthey may not be as\ninterested as before as well.\nNumber four, your relationship\nwith them is one-sided.\nAre you both benefiting\nemotionally from this relationship?\nAre you both supporting each other,\nhearing each other out,\nor do they just come to\nyou with their problems,\nbut don't listen to yours?\nDo they always pick the dates\nwhen you go out with them?\nAre they putting in\nextremely minimal effort?\nThis could be a sign they\naren't really into you\nfor a long-term setting.\nThese signs indicate your\nrelationship could be one-sided.\nSo it's best to sit down and\ntalk about it or call it quits.\nThere are more hardworking\nfish in the sea.\nOnes that will mutually\ngive you that attention\nand support you deserve.\nNumber five, they're just\nhearing what you have to say,\nbut not really listening.\nSo we've covered engagement,\nbut when you're discussing\nserious topics with them,\nare they really listening to you\nor just nodding along\nand then completely changing the topic.\nA healthy relationship\nrequires communication\nand some active listening.\nHonesty is also key.\nIf they cared about you,\nthey would listen to what you have to say,\nrespond thoughtfully and\ncontinue with the conversation,\nespecially if it's on a\ntopic you care about, why?\nBecause they care about you.\nAnd number six,\nthey've told you that they\naren't ready for a relationship.\nBuzz kill, but it's true.\nIt's time to face the facts, my friend.\nIf they've told you they\nain't ready, they ain't ready,\neven if they subtly hinted at\nit, ask them or take the hint.\nIt's best to be on the same\npage with your partner.\nIt's healthy, so if they've told you\nthat they aren't ready for\na new chapter with you,\nor rather they're ready to close the book\non your potential romance,\nthen it's time to close the book\nand head to the library for a new one.\nOdds are their book of choice\nwill be a pasta recipe.\nIf we're talking about\nthe literal sense now,\nah, pasta puttanesca, what?\nWho doesn't love pasta? Leave me alone.\nSo do they like you or like you not?\nLike you or like you not?\nDo you even like them?\nDo you like pasta?\nDo let us know in the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the Like button\nand share it with a friend\nor that person who's not\nthat into you, hmm, too soon?\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for\nwatching.
