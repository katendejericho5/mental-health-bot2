    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\n(jazzy piano music)\nWelcome back to our channel.\nSo you found out some unfortunate news.\nYour crush doesn't like you.\nNooo!\nNot to worry,\nas the saying goes,\nthere are plenty of fish in the sea,\nbut this gets you thinking...\nAre there other people who like\nme without me realizing it?\nWell, there may just be.\nMaybe there's an easy way to\ntell if a stranger likes you,\nor maybe they're your classmate,\nor maybe your friend.\nTo help you find out who out\nthere has a crush on you,\nhere are six signs other\npeople think you're attractive,\nbecause,\nyou know,\nyou are.\nOne.\nTheir voice changes.\nSo you hear someone talking\nto their group of friends\nwhen you decide to approach\nthem and simply say, \"Hi.\"\nSuddenly, their voice totally\nchanges when they address you.\nFor women,\ntheir voice will often\nbecome more high pitched.\nWhile men will often deepen their voice\nwhen attracted to someone.\nTheir tone may also change as well.\nSuddenly, they're much kinder\nor perhaps their voice\nsounds a bit sexier.\nEither way,\nunless they sound rude,\nthey may just have a\nbit of a crush on you.\nTwo.\nThey sweat and their\nbody temperature changes.\nWhen you're deeply attracted\nto someone and around them,\noften your body temperature will rise\njust being in their presence.\nYou may be a bit nervous\nand flushed around them.\nYou may even sweat.\nSo keep a close eye out for\nthese signs in other people,\nspecifically, when they look at you.\nAre their palms sweaty,\ncheeks red,\nhands warm?\nThere are many reasons\nwhy our body temperature may increase.\nSexual attraction is one of them.\nThe question is,\nare they emotionally\nattracted to you as well?\nThree.\nThey compliment your smile or energy.\nDid you like your crush's smile?\nDid you get butterflies when\nthey would smile at you?\nIf you notice someone\nhas been acting a bit nervous around you,\nor maybe they've attempted\nconversation with you,\nand then they choose to\ncompliment your smile,\nthey probably like you.\nIf they also complemented your energy,\nor rather how you make them feel,\nthey may be looking for a sign from you,\na sign of whether or not you like them.\nThis is especially true\nif they've displayed\nsome of the other signs\nmentioned in this video.\nFour.\nThey're awkward around you.\nHow nervous were you around your crush?\nI bet you may have acted\na bit awkward at times.\nAm I right?\nIf you notice someone's behavior\nstrangely shifts when they notice you,\nthis could be a sign\nyou make them nervous.\nWhy?\nBecause they're attracted to you.\nSo if you notice they\nfumble over their words\nor get lost in your eyes,\nthey were probably just unprepared\nfor how amazingly attractive you are.\nFive.\nThey help and defend you.\nDo you notice someone is\nalways there to help you?\nMaybe they offer to do a favor for you\nor they choose to join\nyour side and defend you\nwhen you're defending yourself\nin a heated exchange or discussion.\nThey're not only a kind friend\nwho's always there for you,\nbut if they show other signs\nof attraction along with this,\nthey probably have some\ndeep feelings for you.\nThey wanna be there for you as a friend\nand maybe as something more.\nIf you notice more signs of attraction,\nalong with this one,\nthey've probably felt\nthis way for a long time.\nSix.\nThey want to look their best around you.\nWhen we like someone,\nwe want to appear our best around them.\nPeople will often fix their hair,\nadjust their clothes,\nor straighten their posture\naround people they are attracted to.\nSo if you notice them subtly\nattempting to get the remains\nof that spinach casserole\nout of their teeth,\nright when they thought you turned away,\nwell, if you like them back,\nask them out and hand\nthem that dental floss.\nGet flossin'.\nJust the teeth, not the dance.\nOh, you've already started dancing.\nSo do you think someone likes you?\nHave you seen these\nsigns in someone before,\nbut didn't realize they liked\nyou until it was too late?\nWho,\nwhat, when, where,\nhow did it turn out?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nIf you did,\ndon't forget to click the \"like\" button\nand share it with a friend,\nor your crush.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon,\nfor more content like this.\nAs always,\nthanks for watching."
