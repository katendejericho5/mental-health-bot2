    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nIf you have kids,\nI'm sure that every single\nthing you do for them\nyou do while keeping their\nbest interest at heart.\nYou want them to be as healthy\nand happy as they can be.\nBut parenting is\ncertainly not an easy job.\nAnd no matter how hard you try,\nit can sometimes be difficult\nto avoid making some mistakes.\nEven though a lot of parents\nknow their youngster the best,\nchild psychologists have been researching\nchildren's development for decades\nand most commonly agree\nthat some parenting methods\ncan actually be damaging\nto a child's growth.\nSo, what are they?\nHere are some common mistakes parents make\nthat can be detrimental to\ntheir kids' development.\nNumber one, signing kids\nup for too many activities.\nLoving parents often want\ntheir kids to be smart,\nactive, and talented.\nWhat better way to achieve\nthat than by signing them up\nfor a bunch of extracurricular activities?\nFootball practice, guitar lessons,\nforeign language, and art classes.\nThese activities are great\nfor a child's physical,\nemotional, and social development.\nBut the problem arises when\nthere are just too many.\nConstantly jumping from\none lesson to another\nwhile trying to balance\nschool and homework\ncan negatively impact a\nchild's sleeping habits.\nIt can also negatively affect\ntheir mental health as well,\nmaking them prone to depressive moods\nand making it difficult for\nthem to cope with stress.\nBut how much is too much?\nThe answer is easy.\nJust listen to your children.\nParents should be aware of how busy\nand stressed their children are.\nWhether they express it to\nthem or simply show signs.\nAlso, follow the golden mean.\nResearch published in Journal\nof Youth and Adolescents\nstated that children who are engaged\nin only a moderate amount of activity,\ncompared to those with a\nlarger amount of hobbies,\nhad better results in school.\nBy giving kids enough time for school,\nhobbies, play, and rest,\nparents can help them learn\ntime management skills\nand relieve them of unnecessary stresses.\nNumber two, not allowing kids to say no.\nSometimes it seems like from the moment\nour little one start talking,\nthe word no becomes their\nmost cherished word.\nQuestions ranging from \"Did\nyou wanna eat your veggies?\"\nto \"Will you share your\ntoys with your sister?\"\nare often greeted with\na loud and clear no.\nAnd most of the time,\nthis answer is followed by a\nparent's anger and frustration.\n\"I'm your parent.\nYou can't say no to me.\"\nOf course, teaching kids respect\ntowards their parents is important.\nBut letting them,\nmoreover, teaching them,\nhow to say no might be\neven more important.\nIf children are never allowed to say no,\nthey might not learn\nhow to gain confidence,\nhow to communicate their boundaries,\nor how to stand their ground.\nThis can become a big\nproblem once they grow up\nto get into romantic relationships\nor start working.\nAccording to 2008 research\non child development,\nwhile arguing with their\nparents, by saying no,\nchildren could bring that\nattitude to relationships\nwith their peers and practice\nstanding up for themselves.\nOf course, the goal is to teach\nthem how to say no politely\nand respectfully,\nwhich in turn could help\nthem protect themselves,\nmaintain identity, and\ndevelop a positive self image.\nNumber three, comparing\nchildren to others.\nHave you ever asked your child,\n\"Why can't you be more like your brother?\"\nOr perhaps your parents used to tell you,\n\"Look how good other children behave.\"\nComparing children to their\nsiblings or other children\nis a trap many parents fall\ninto, intentionally or not.\nYou might think that\nthis would motivate them\nto behave better,\nbut being constantly compared to others\ncould actually hurt their\nlittle hearts pretty badly.\nBy comparing your child to\nsomeone else in a negative way,\nyou are in a way telling them\nthat some other kid is better than them.\nThis can ruin your child's\nself-esteem from an early age.\nThey may also think they're not living up\nto your expectations,\nwhich could make them think\nthat you don't like them\nor love them as much as you actually do.\nWhat you could try instead\nis setting up realistic\nexpectations for your children.\nCelebrate their strengths.\nAnd if they make a mistake\nthat other children don't,\nlet them know you love them regardless.\nNumber four, forcing children to eat.\nDid you have that one specific food\nthat you simply hated as a kid?\nDid that food happen to be\nsome very healthy vegetable\nthat your parents made you eat,\nresulting in tears and\nscreaming during dinner\nand threats of not leaving the table\nuntil you empty your plate?\nIn a study written by psychologists\nfrom several universities in the USA,\n70% of adults said that they\nhad experienced being forced\nto eat in their childhood.\nAs a result today,\nthey see themselves as picky eaters\nand more restrictive\nin their eating habits,\noften avoiding that specific\nfood they were forced to eat.\nThis is a result from\nassociating that food\nwith negative social context:\nfights, yelling, punishments, or threats.\nAlso, being forced to eat may be connected\nto a child's weight.\nAnother research study published\nin the International Journal of Obesity\nfound that preschool\nchildren who weren't allowed\nto choose the food they liked to eat\nhad more problems with their weight.\nOf course, it's important\nto make sure your kids eat healthy meals,\nbut there are ways\nto ensure their eating habits stay healthy\nwithout making your\ndinner table a war field.\nMake sure that mealtimes\nare relaxed and fun.\nAsk your kid to help you prepare the meal\nor give them a choice every now and then.\nAsk them, \"Would you like\ncarrots or green beans today?\"\nThese are all good places to start.\nNumber five, using\nhumiliation as discipline.\nMaybe you've come across Facebook posts\nfrom moms and dads\nsharing their frustrations\nabout their kids with hundreds\nof friends and relatives.\n\"How do I make my son\nclean his messy room?\nHe never listens!\"\nOr maybe you've seen an angry\nparent yelling at their child\nin front of their friends.\nShaming and humiliating\nchildren in front of others\nis one of those discipline methods\nthat may seem appropriate\nin the heat of the moment\nbut should actually be avoided completely.\nAs stated by Andy Grogan-Kaylor,\nan associate professor of social work\nat the University of Michigan,\nshaming a child or\nmaking them feel degraded\nleads to all kinds of behavioral\nand emotional problems\nin the future.\nChildren who are shamed\nin front of their friends\ncan feel embarrassed, cry in shame,\nand repeat the same mistakes\nbecause of the nervousness they feel.\nThis way of dealing with\nchildren's bad behavior\ncan also make them become socially anxious\nas a result of the shame they feel,\nand they can become depressed\nor aggressive as a result.\nIt can also set them up\nto be bullied in school,\nas well as lose trust in their parents.\nSo when your children choose to misbehave,\nit would be best to take them aside\nand have a private conversation.\nBy doing that, you can help\nstrengthen your relationship\nand keep your child's dignity untouched.\nAnd number six, praising\na child's intelligence\nrather than hard work.\nDid you get praised about the\nwork you put into studying\nor only praised on the perfect grade?\nNot many things in life\nmake a parent more proud\nthan seeing a big red A on\ntheir child's school report.\nNaturally, the next thing\nyou'd wanna do is praise them.\n\"You did such a good\njob, you are so smart!\"\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith praising your children, of course,\nbut focusing your praise\nsolely on their abilities\nrather than their hard\nwork can actually be bad\nfor their future motivation and beliefs.\nAmerican psychologist Carol\nDweck thought about this\nin her mindset theory,\nwhere she connected praise,\nachievements, and motivation.\nAccording to her,\npraising children only\nfor their intelligence\nleads towards the creation\nof a fixed mindset.\nWhen a child with a fixed\nmindset fails at something,\nthey tend to think that they're\nnot smart enough to succeed.\nThey may become less\nmotivated to try harder\nand get worse results overall.\nBut if you focus your\npraise on your kids' effort,\nsaying, \"Good job, you must\nhave worked very hard,\"\nthose kids will believe\nthat even if they fail,\nthey can achieve better\nresults if they try harder.\nThey're motivated to keep\npushing and learning,\nand they tend to do better at school.\nSo it's best to keep that\nin mind the next time\nyour child brings home\na perfect test score.\nDo you relate to some of\nthese points as a parent?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nOr maybe your parents made\nsome of these mistakes\nwhile you were growing up.\nEven if that is the case, the\ntake-home message is simple.\nThere's no such thing as a perfect person,\nno such thing as a perfect parent.\nFinding ways to better yourself every day,\nlearning as you go to avoid mistakes,\nand most importantly,\ngiving your kids unconditional\nlove is all that matters\nin the end.\nFeel free to like and share\nthis video if it helped you\nor you think it could help someone else.\nDon't forget to
