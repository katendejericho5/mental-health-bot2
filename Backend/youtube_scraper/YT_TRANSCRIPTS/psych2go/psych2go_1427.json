    "transcript": "- [Voiceover] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nEver feel like people aren't listening\nor paying attention to you?\nOr have you ever wondered,\nare people ignoring me?\nWhy?\nBeing ignored is painful\nand can be confusing,\nespecially when it's coming\nfrom people you know and love.\nRegardless of who it is\nthat's giving you the silent treatment,\nyou may want to understand why\nand what you can do to remedy it.\nSo with that said, here\nare eight subtle habits\nthat make people ignore you.\nNumber one, you're trying too hard.\nWe want to make connections with people\nwho we find interesting.\nWe know that that requires initiating\nand maintaining contact\nand allowing a connection\nto grow over time.\nWhen you're forcing\ninteractions with people,\nit turns them away from you.\nThey can tell you're being disingenuous\nby changing your personality\ndepending on who you're around.\nWhile relationships with friends\nare not like those with your colleagues,\nwhen you're trying too hard\nto be someone you're not,\npeople can sense your desperation\nand might pull away.\nNumber two, you're selfish.\nEven though the word narcissism\nhas a bad reputation,\nhaving healthy narcissism is good.\nIt's self-confidence and\na good view of yourself,\nwhich is normal and necessary.\nHowever, when you only\never talk about yourself\nand steal the spotlight\nfrom others socially,\nthat can make people resent you\nbecause you don't contribute to the group\nwhere others share.\nIf you think that only you\ndeserve the compliments\nand the limelight,\nand that everyone else must\nhear about your trip to Paris,\nthey'll see that as\narrogance and disengage.\nAnd if you're the friend\nwho always conveniently\nforgets their wallet\nand your friends have to pay for you,\noh boy, that might be\nyour last free dinner.\nThree, you're disengaged.\nWhen you're around friends or colleagues,\nengaging in conversations can\nbring about increased morale\nor just a time to vent.\nWhen you're too socially\npassive or lack assertiveness,\npeople could see this as aloofness\nor that you're not interested\nin the conversation\nand start ignoring you.\nWe all enjoy engaging with\npeople who interact in return,\nso the passivity could\nmake them ignore you.\nNumber four, you're extremely negative.\nNegative people are tiring to be around.\nIt's like running a\nmarathon that never ends.\nYour energy is depleted and\nyou just want to get away.\nBeing angry and depressed\noccasionally is fine\nbecause emotions are normal,\nbut people will run and\nhide from negativity.\nIf you're a person who is\nhypocritical of others,\nnever happy, and prefers to be miserable,\nthen people will ignore you\nbecause the chronic\nnegativity is contagious.\nFive, your body language\nis repelling them.\nYou don't have to be an\nexpert in body language\nto pick up on when\nsomeone doesn't like you\nor is disinterested in your opinion,\nbecause we are all social creatures.\nWe generally understand social cues\nand what they mean in certain contexts.\nIf you think that people are ignoring you,\na surprising reason could be\nthat your body language is\nuninviting or defensive.\nYou don't have to have\nyour arms out all the time\nto convey openness,\nbut generally constricting\nposes like folding your arms,\nfrowning and looking\naway is usually a sign\nthat you're not interested,\nand people might pick up on\nthat and choose to stay away.\nNumber six, you don't take responsibility.\nAnother habit that makes people ignore you\nis being irresponsible and\nthen not owning up to it.\nBeing an actual victim is\na horrible thing to happen,\nbut when you're the perpetual victim,\npeople aren't going to\nwant to be around you.\nIf you're someone who's never guilty\nor at fault even when you are,\nthat behavior is a good reason\nfor people to have no contact with you.\nYou can be a victim sometimes,\nbut you can't be a victim all the time.\nNot taking responsibility for your actions\nand the consequences makes\nyou undesirable, number one.\nNumber seven, you're too intense.\nPassion is a beautiful thing.\nIt's the driving force of creation\nand an admirable, attractive\ntrait in a person,\nespecially when their passion\nis about something in their life.\nThe opposite side of that\nis when a person's passion\nleads them to being\ndomineering and controlling.\nA social tyrant who wants\nto micromanage everything\nthat everyone does.\nThey don't care about the\nbest place for their friends\nto go to dinner collectively.\nThey will choose one, and\nthat's the end of the story.\nThis behavior is seen as bossy,\nand no one likes being\nbullied into things.\nAnd finally, number\neight, you're too needy.\nAsking for advice and assurance\nfrom friends is normal,\nespecially when you're going\nthrough something difficult.\nIt feels good to know that\nyou have someone to lean on.\nBut if you're the type\nof friend or colleague\nthat needs to be constantly\nvalidated on their work\nor it needs constant unnecessary\napproval to do something,\nthat can be a downer and draining\nfor the people around you.\nIf you're not standing\non your own sometimes,\nand constantly going to others for help,\npeople will see that as\nbeing clingy and needy\nand will start ignoring you.\nIt might help to take\nother factors into account,\nlike how being unable to\nread and give social cues\ncould be a reason,\nor how having social\nanxiety can be relevant.\nHave any of these points\nresonated with you?\nIf so, they may be clues on what habits\nmight be off-putting.\nIf you like this video,\nmake sure to share it with friends\nand let us know if you\ndid in the comment below.\nAs always, the studies and references\nare listed in the description box.\nUntil next time, and thanks for watching."
