    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nDid you know if you have depression,\nyou can help your symptoms\nby avoiding certain foods?\nThere are various ways\nto treat depressive symptoms.\nThe most traditional route\ninvolves talk therapy\nand sometimes medication,\nbut there are other ways\nto help battle depression.\nSelf-care and changing your eating habits\ncan be helpful too.\nYour gut health has a far greater impact\non your mental health\nthan you may realize.\nResearch from clinical psychopharmacology\nand neuroscience shows that\nthe microbiota living in your gut\ncommunicates with\nneurotransmitters in your brain\nand vice versa,\nvia the vagus nerve.\nSo it makes sense\nthat what we put into our gut\ncan impact our mental health.\nHere are five foods\nyou should avoid\nto help your mental health.\nNumber one, fast foods.\na 2017 paper on immunology\nby Andrew Miller and Charles Raison\ndemonstrated a link\nbetween inflammation and depression.\nIt found the release of\ninflammatory cytokines\nimpinges upon the behavior\nof neuro-transmitters and neural circuits,\nwhich results in poor\nbehavioral functioning.\nInflammation happens when something\ntriggers an immune response.\nWhile external factors\ncan cause inflammation in your body,\nfood, particularly fast foods,\ncan exacerbate it.\nFast foods typically contain\nhigh amounts of refined\nand artificial ingredients,\nwhich make you more susceptible\nto depressive episodes.\nA 2011 paper published\nin Cambridge University Press\nfound that those who consumed\nprocessed commercial baked goods\nwere at a higher risk for depression.\nA similar study was published\nin 2016 by SpringerLink\nregarding fried foods.\nGiving up these types of foods\nmay seem a bit strict.\nBut if you must eat processed foods,\ndo so with moderation and sensibility.\nThe best solution is to\nfind healthier substitutes.\nNumber two, alcohol.\nAlcohol is another thing you should avoid\nif you have depression.\nIt is a depressant\nas it slows down your\ncentral nervous system.\nBecause it is a small molecule,\nalcohol can easily cross the brain barrier\nand neurologically affect it.\nIt usually contracts your brain\nand destroys your brain cells\nwhile it depresses your\ncentral nervous system.\nAdditionally, it interferes\nbetween your brain receptors,\nwhich causes a disconnect\nbetween your thoughts\nand physical actions.\nLong-term consumption of alcohol can cause\nneuro-cognitive deficiencies\nand neurodegeneration.\nIt's common to grab a glass of wine\nor champagne during celebrations,\nbut always drink in moderation.\nMany people resort to alcohol\nas a coping mechanism.\nIf this is the case for you,\nplease reach out to a therapist\nto help you find a\nbetter and healthier way\nto cope with emotional distress.\nNumber three, salt.\nSalt is vital when preparing food.\nIt helps highlight the\nflavor of the ingredients\nand makes the meal taste better.\nAlso, some salt provide\nminerals to our bodies.\nHowever, in some cases,\nsalt, table salt especially,\ncan be harmful to our health\nas it is a refined salt\nthat lacks minerals.\nThis is the kind of salt\nthat usually leads\nto high blood pressure and heart disease.\nNot surprisingly, salt can also\ncause other complications.\nStudies have shown that salt\nincreases inflammation,\nharms gut microbiomes,\nand affects blood flow to the brain.\nThe use of salt can also cause\nor worsen depression,\nand impair cognitive function.\nSo instead of dousing your food in salt,\nadd a sprinkle.\nYou can also try\nsubstituting your table salt\nfor Himalayan or Celtic salt,\nwhich has more minerals\nthan the alternative.\nNumber four, refined grains.\nAnother food you should avoid\nif you have depression is refined grains.\nUnfortunately, most of our favorite foods\nlike pizza, pasta, and cake\nare culprits of worsening mental health.\nMost commercial foods\nare made using refined grains,\nwhich have none to very\nlittle nutritional value.\nWhat you're mainly eating\nis the starchy part of\nthe grain, the endosperm.\nWhen you eat refined\ngrains over whole ones,\nyou miss out on the nutrients\nstored in the germ and the bran.\nThese two contain vitamins,\nhealthy fats, minerals,\nfibers, and phytochemicals.\nNecessary things that your body and brain\nneed to function well.\nThe endosperm primarily contains\nstarchy carbohydrates, some proteins,\nand some vitamins and minerals.\nWhile most manufacturers\ninject the endosperm\nwith the minerals and vitamins\nthey initially removed,\nit's best to eat whole grains.\nA 2020 study in PubMed.gov\nby Deborah Gibson-Smith and others\nfound that those who ate whole grains\nwere at lower risk\nfor depression and anxiety disorders.\nSo instead of reaching\nfor a refined product\nlike white bread or white rice,\ntry whole wheat, wild rice, or quinoa.\nYou never know,\nthey might become staples in your meals.\nAnd number five, artificial\nsweeteners and refined sugars.\nThe last food group\nyou should try to avoid\nif you have depression\nis artificial sweeteners\nand refined sugars.\nThese usually come in the form\nof high fructose corn syrup\nor other substitutes\nlike aspartame, saccharin, and acesulfame.\nWhile some of these sweeteners\nmay not impact the calories we consume,\nthey certainly have an\nimpact on our health.\nOver consumption of\nexceedingly sweet foods\nmade with artificial sweeteners\ncan make you shun fruits and vegetables,\nand pursue processed foods\nwith a similar flavor profile\nbecause sweeteners are highly addictive.\nA study done on lab mice\nproved that these sweeteners\nwere more addictive than cocaine.\nAdditionally, over consumption\nof these sweeteners\nmay increase your risk for obesity,\nheart disease and Type II diabetes.\nHowever, the most detrimental repercussion\nof consuming artificial sweeteners\nis how they affect your brain.\nNot only do additive sweeteners\nproduce inflammation,\nbut they can affect brain development.\nMost of the research\nsurrounding the effects\nof artificial sweeteners\non the brain is vague.\nHowever, a 1987 paper from\nthe US National Library of Medicine\nand Nation Institutes of Health\nposited the possible link\nbetween a sweetener like\naspartame and seizures.\nIt found that increased consumption\nincreases brain phenylalanine,\na certain kind of amino acid\nthat could trigger seizures.\nIt did not assert that sweeteners\nwere the direct cause of seizures,\nbut did state that\nconsumption of aspartame\ncan cause seizures among\nsusceptible people.\nAdditionally, a more recent paper\nby Arbind Choudhary and others\nin PubMed.gov explored\nthe neurobehavioral effects of aspartame\nand its metabolites.\nThey measured neurophysiological symptoms\ncaused by aspartame\nand warned about adverse\nneurobehavioral effects.\nOverall, try not to consume\nartificial sweeteners.\nIf you have a sweet tooth,\nopt for foods that contain sugar\nin their natural form, like fruit.\nYour mental health\nbegins with your gut health.\nSo treat yourself kindly\nand make sure you provide\nyour brain and body\nthe nutrients it needs.\nHave you noticed how you feel\nif you change what you eat?\nLet us know in the comments
