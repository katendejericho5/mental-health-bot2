and\njoining the Psych2Go fam.\nNow, let's begin.\nHave you been in a\nrelationship with a narcissist?\nIf so, you might understand\nhow they can be smart,\nmanipulative, and how they won't give up\non getting what they want.\nBecause of their manipulative\ntendencies and tactics,\nyou might find yourself stuck, helpless,\nor emotionally drained from\nyour relationship with them.\nYou might even feel like\nthere's no way to stop\ntheir power over you.\nSo, to help empower you,\nhere are 11 smart ways\nto outsmart a narcissist.\nNumber one, heal yourself.\nHave you noticed that you always go back\nto your relationship with a narcissist\nwhen you feel at your lowest point?\nOftentimes, narcissists will\nexploit your vulnerability\nand insecurities when you're\nfeeling at your worst.\nSo, a way to outsmart them\nand to not let them come\nback into your life again\nis by focusing on healing yourself\nand getting back control\nover your own life.\nNumber two, mirror their behavior.\nNarcissists thrive on\ngetting a reaction from you.\nThey might do things to purposely hurt you\nand to get you to respond\nin a very emotional manner.\nIn cases like these, you can\ntry mirroring their actions.\nBy doing this, you reflect\ntheir anger back onto them,\nwhere it belongs.\nNumber three, cut off contact.\nIt can be hard to cut off\nall contact with someone\nthat you've been in a relationship with.\nHowever, if you keep in touch\nwith them after ending things,\nyou may only be giving them\nand their toxic behavior\nthe opportunity to slide\nback into your life.\nNumber four, use the grey rock method.\nIf you find it impossible to\ncut off all contact with them,\nyou could try the grey rock method.\nThis is when you take a\nstep back and avoid reacting\nto any of the communication they send you.\nInstead, you can ask someone\nto read the emails, letters,\nor text messages for you.\nThis way, it can give you a\nlittle distance and clarity\nto understand the\nreality of the situation.\nNumber five, agree with them.\nThis may sound contradictory,\nbut narcissists tend to take\npleasure in shaming people.\nFor example, a narcissist parent\nmay shame you for how\nstrict or lenient you are\nwith your own children.\nIf they say this, agree with them.\nBy doing this, you're taking\nthe wind out of their sails.\nBecause they're so used\nto getting a response,\nthey may end up not knowing\nhow to respond at all.\nThis is the power of non-resistance.\nAs you mirror their words back to them\nand show their behavior\nfor how it really is,\nthere's very little that\nthey can do about it.\nNumber six, keep your\ncards close to your chest.\nAs mentioned before,\nnarcissists like to exploit\nyour vulnerabilities\nand insecurities.\nSo, it's important\nthat you don't try to explain your reasons\nor rationalize with them\nwhen they're trying to attack you.\nThe more you try to explain yourself,\nthe weaker your position becomes.\nNumber seven, challenge your\nown thoughts and situation.\nAs surprising as it may seem,\nnarcissists are actually\nvery fragile and insecure.\nThis is why they often use other people\nto make themselves feel better,\nwhether it's by shifting the blame\nor projecting their weaknesses\nor insecurities onto you,\nthey'll try to make it seem\nlike you are the one with\nproblems in the relationship.\nSo, try to challenge yourself\nand ask yourself whether\nwhat they say is true.\nBy doing this, you can see your situation\nwith more clarity and understanding.\nNumber eight, you need\nto remain very calm.\nSince narcissists like to manipulate\nand find ways to cause\nyou emotional distress,\nit can feel really\ndifficult to remain calm\nin the relationship,\nwhether it's accusing you for being angry\nor being upset at you for\nsomething you didn't do,\nthey will try to get an\nemotional response from you.\nBecause of this, it's important\nfor you to remain calm.\nBy responding in a calm\nor unemotional manner,\nyou undermine their\nattempt of hurting you.\nNumber nine, find ways to disengage.\nDo you give them a lot of your attention?\nSomething a narcissist will often do\nis use the victim card to\ngain sympathy from you.\nThe more attention you give\nthem, the more they thrive.\nAny attention is better than\nnone at all to a narcissist.\nSo, a way to outsmart them\nis to find ways to disengage\nfrom their fairytales\nand focus on something else.\nNumber 10, refuse to play.\nNarcissists lack empathy,\nand rarely form emotional\nattachments with others.\nSo, if you find yourself\nin a relationship with one,\nyou may find that they don't really care\nfor your wellbeing at all.\nInstead, they might take\npleasure in causing you distress.\nIf seen as a game of chess,\nnarcissists are the type\nwho will take every measure\nto beat you in the game.\nSo, the only way for you\nto change the outcome\nis for you to take\nyourself out of the game\nand remove any power they have over you.\nAnd, number 11, listen to your body.\nDo you get triggered easily?\nNarcissists like to say or do things\nthat emotionally and mentally hurt you.\nThe trauma that can come from\nthe verbal or emotional abuse\noften leaves a mark and may\nmanifest in a number of ways,\nincluding feeling anxious, stressed,\nor triggered by certain\nwords, scenes, or people.\nSo, when you listen to your body\nand use techniques such as\nmeditation, deep breathing,\nand visualization,\nyou reduce your stress\nand help yourself become\nmore level-minded again.\nThis, in turn, will\nmake it harder for them\nto manipulate you again.\nIf you, or somebody you know,\nhave experienced narcissistic abuse,\nthen please reach out and\nspeak to somebody you trust.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified
