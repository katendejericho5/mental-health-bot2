    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you ever feel like you're more mature\nthan those around you?\nA lot of people think that\nmaturity comes with age,\nsince older people have had\nmore time to gain experience.\nHowever, that might\nnot always be the case.\nIn psychology, maturity is\ndescribed as a person's ability\nto respond to a situation or environment\nin an appropriate way.\nYou might feel a bit out of place,\nbut being more mature than\nothers is actually good,\nsince you're better at\nhandling different situations.\nIn this video, we will be addressing\nseven signs that you're\nmore mature than others.\nNumber one.\nYou take time more seriously.\nHow well do you manage your time?\nIf you take your time seriously\nand manage it in a way\nto use it efficiently and effectively,\nthen you're likely more\nmature than others.\nYou've come to the realization\nthat time is very valuable\nand you hate wasting it.\nThis applies to other people's time too.\nFor example, you don't\nlike being late to meetings\nbecause you respect and value\nother people's time as well.\nYou now spend much less time doing things\nthat don't help you\nmove toward your goals.\nHowever, you also know that\nassigning some time for hobbies\nis important.\nNumber two.\nYou embrace responsibility.\nDo you feel that as you age,\nthe more responsibilities you have?\nThis is one of the\nmisconceptions that people have.\nResponsibility actually\ncomes with experience\nrather than age.\nSo if you're someone who\nembraces responsibility,\nyou can be considered\nmore mature than others.\nYou find yourself facing these\nresponsibilities head-on,\ninstead of constantly running\naway or postponing them.\nYou prefer getting things done\nand then relaxing with a clear mind,\nrather than leaving things undone\nand doing something else\nto distract yourself.\nNumber three.\nYou respect every opinion.\nHow open-minded are you\nwhile listening to other\npeople's ideas and opinions?\nOne of the biggest signs\nthat you are more mature than\nothers is the flexibility\nand respect that you have\nfor other people's opinions.\nYou have come to understand\nthat no one's subjective\nopinions are necessarily wrong.\nIt all comes down to the perspective\nwith which people see things.\nBeing able to accept and\nrespect other people's opinions\nwill remove any unnecessary\ndrama from your life\nand help you gain the respect of others.\nNumber four.\nYou are in charge of your emotions.\nDo you often let your emotions\ntake charge of your actions?\nWhile it's true that ignoring\nyour feelings and emotions is bad,\nyou should not let them\ncompletely take over\nwhen making decisions.\nLetting any emotion get out of control\ncan have negative effects\non your own emotional health\nand interpersonal relationships.\nAdditionally, according to Vicki Botnick,\na therapist in Tarzana, California,\n\"Any emotion can intensify to a point\n\"where it's difficult to control.\"\nSo being able to keep\nyour emotions in check\nis a great skill\nthat makes you stand out as\nsomeone more mature than others.\nNumber five.\nYour career matters to you,\neven if it's temporary.\nAre you who's someone who\nwould neglect something at work\nbecause you're only\nworking there temporarily?\nIt's not unusual to see people\nnot completing tasks to\nthe best of their abilities\nbecause they're not going\nto be there permanently.\nHowever, if you're someone responsible\nwho takes their job seriously,\nthen you are more mature than others.\nYou don't care whether you're only there\nfor one day or five years,\nyou do everything to the\nbest of your abilities.\nYou understand that this\nis a great quality to have\nand that most employers value it.\nYou know that the opinions\nof your bosses or supervisors\nare important to build a strong resume\nthat will help you move forward\nwith whichever career path you choose.\nNumber six.\nYou focus on self-improvement.\nDo you ever take time off to focus on\nthe things that you need\nto do to improve yourself?\nIf you do this often,\nthen this is a clear sign\nthat you are more mature than others.\nThe more mature you are,\nthe more you will understand\nthat constantly improving yourself\nmakes life much better and more valuable.\nYou are aware that as you keep improving,\nmore paths and options open up\nbecause of the progress that you've made.\nThis is what will set you\napart from other people\nwho have a more passive attitude\ntowards their self-improvement.\nAnd number seven, you have\nno expectations of others.\nDo you often have high\nexpectations of others?\nWell, this can be one of the easiest ways\nto feel disappointed.\nHaving little to no expectations of others\nis a big sign that you are\nmore mature than others.\nThis is because the more\nyou expect from people,\nthe more pain you're\ninviting into your own life.\nYou understand that if you\nwant someone to do something,\nthen you should be the\nfirst to take action.\nAdditionally, expecting less from someone\nmakes you feel that much nicer\nwhen someone does something for you.\nDo you relate to any of these signs?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you can relate to any of the signs\ndiscussed in this video,\nthen it's likely that you\nare more mature than others.\nYou are able to deal with\ndifferent situations and changes\nmore efficiently and\neffectively than other people.\nIf you enjoyed this
