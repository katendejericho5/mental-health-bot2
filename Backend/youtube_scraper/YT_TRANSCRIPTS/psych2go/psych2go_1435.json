responsibilities\nwe've all had our off days we've all\nfelt lazy unmotivated and uninspired\nfrom time to time and it's normal to\nfeel like that\nbut we live in such a hyper competitive\nsociety that's so hyper focused on\npursuing success and wealth that it's\nmade us feel internally guilty for the\ntime we spend not working towards\nsomething productive\nwhen you overwork yourself to exhaustion\nand are dealing with chronic stress it\nwill inevitably have adverse effects on\nyour mental and emotional health\nbut what if it could be more than that\nwhat if your laziness is more than just\nyou feeling burnt out\nhere are six warning signs of depression\nthat are more than just laziness\nnumber one\nyou can't snap yourself out of it\na sense of laziness usually creeps in\nwhen you're overly stressed or if you've\nbeen working too hard for too long\nand there are a lot of nifty tips and\ntricks you can use to snap yourself out\nof it like making a to-do list listening\nto motivational talks or setting\nachievable goals\nbut when it's depression\ndepression isn't a choice and it's\ndefinitely not something you can just\nshake off or get over\nno matter what other people tell you\ndepression is a serious mental illness\nthat needs to be treated with\nprofessional help and medication if\nrequired\noftentimes depressive episodes can recur\nthroughout your life so months of\ntherapy may be needed to help you cope\nnumber two\nyou can't cheer yourself up\ndo you often struggle with feelings of\nunexplained loneliness sadness and\nhopelessness\ndo you feel exhausted all the time and\nrarely have any energy\nyou might be feeling downcast and\ndisheartened for reasons you just don't\nunderstand\nand nothing you do seems to cheer you up\nor make you feel better no amount of\nsleep comfort food self-care activities\nor fun times with friends seem to do\nmuch to brighten your spirits\nwhen you're battling depression not even\ndoing the things you used to love the\nmost or spending time with your loved\nones can make you feel better number\nthree you've lost interest in everything\naccording to the american psychological\nassociation a markedly diminished\ninterest of pleasure in activities is\none of the hallmarks of a depressive\nepisode\nso if you found that your laziness has\nmade you lose motivation and interest in\neverything including school and work\nthen that's a sure sign that something\nis seriously wrong with your mental\nhealth with depression you tend to lose\ninterest in your hobbies and emotionally\nwithdraw from those around you you\nprefer to stay at home and lay in bed\ndoing nothing most of the day because\nyou just can't find it in yourself to\ncare enough about much of anything\nanymore\nnumber four you can't function like you\nused to\ndo you feel that your laziness is\ngetting out of hand has it become too\nmuch for you to manage\nis it getting in the way of your work\nyour school or your personal life\nif you answered yes to any of these\nquestions then you may be dealing with\ndepression\nin diagnosing depression psychologists\ntend to look at the four d's of\nabnormality\nthey are deviance distress\ndanger and dysfunction\nso if your laziness is making you\ndysfunctional significantly interferes\nwith your everyday tasks and feels like\na constant hurdle in your life\nthen it may be time to see a mental\nhealth care professional about it\nnumber five\nyour laziness isn't triggered by\nanything\noftentimes laziness manifests as\nprocrastination and may be brought on by\na number of different reasons\nsome believe a sense of laziness\nreflects a lack of self-esteem while\nothers would argue it's because of a\nlack of positive recognition from others\nit could also be due to a lack of\ndiscipline self-control and interest\nbut what about depression\nwhat brings about depression\nwell the truth is\npsychologists don't really know\nbut one thing we do know for sure is\nthat it isn't usually triggered by just\none particular thing\nthere isn't always a clear reason for\nwhy depression might develop\nso if you find yourself feeling down\ndisheartened and unenergetic all of a\nsudden\ndepression may be the reason why\nand number six\nyour laziness isn't a choice\nfinally but perhaps most importantly the\nkey difference between depression and\nlaziness is that while laziness can be\nchanged depression isn't so easily\naltered\nif you're feeling tired or unmotivated\nyou can do something to change that for\nyourself you can rest brainstorm look\nfor inspiration and try out different\nproductivity hacks to help you get out\nof your funk\nbut with depression it's not that easy\nit's not a funk that you can just get\nout of\nwhen you have depression you're
