    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nHabits.\nThey can change our behavior,\nalter our interests\nand improve certain skills\nwith enough time and determination.\nDid you know that some habits\nmight just make you more\nattractive to others?\nHere are just a few of the habits\nthat can make you attractive to others.\nNumber one, learning something new.\nHow often do you learn something new?\nThe more knowledge you possess,\nthe more intelligent\nyou may seem to others,\nas they can learn quite a lot from you.\nA 2019 research study wanted\nto determine whether smart\nis often seen as sexy.\nResearchers asked around 600 adults\nto rate a list of\nhypothetical people based\non how desirable they were.\nThey found that for everyone in the study,\nfor all kinds of relationships,\nthere was a significant\ndesire to have a partner\nwho was either as smart\nas them or smarter.\nHmm, so is there anything\nyou've always wanted to learn?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nNumber two, having an androgynous style\nand/or androgynous traits.\nAccording to a 1983 study\nfrom Dr. Linda A. Jackson\nfrom Michigan State University,\nthose with both feminine\nand masculine attributes\nwere often rated as more attractive.\nThe study states that\nthe results indicated\nthat androgynous persons\nwere favorably perceived on\nthe gender-linked dimensions\nof instrumentality and expressivity,\nand in sex-neutral desirable\ntraits they were regarded\nas better adjusted, more likable\nand as having an advantage\nin the occupational domain\ncompared to masculine\nand feminine persons.\nNumber three, often leading in groups.\nDo you want your crush to notice you?\nWell, if you want others to\nsee you as more attractive,\nmake it a habit to bring out\nthat leader deep inside you.\nIn a 2014 study, researchers found\nthat subordinates rated their group leader\nas significantly more attracted\nthan leaders outside their group.\nSo even if there is no\nrule of group leader\nin your next project,\nbe more vocal about your\nideas and teach others.\nYou can teach them all the\ngreat things you've learned\nfrom your habitual trips to the library.\nThere are plenty of ways\nin which you can lead.\nOn your next date, suggest\na place you know all about,\nand take the lead on a romantic adventure,\na beautiful hike, an interesting game,\nthe possibilities are endless.\nShow them what you enjoy in your life\nand lead the way next time\nyou hang out with them.\nNumber four, maintain good grooming.\nDo you have style?\nHow are your grooming habits?\nDo you iron your shirts, press your pants?\nDressing nice and being\nwell groomed is an easy way\nto get someone to notice you.\nAnd while you don't\nneed to iron every piece\nof clothing of yours before you go out,\nit can be admirable to see\nsomeone very well put together.\nAnd having great hygiene\nis an attractive quality\nin and of itself.\nExpress who you are by wearing\nwhat makes you feel confident and happy.\nIf you feel like you,\nyou'll likely feel more comfortable\nand approachable to others.\nPsychologist Jeremy Nicholson,\nthe writer for Psychology Today,\nexplains that research\nhas shown a large part\nof physical attraction is centered\non the more changeable aspects\nof our self-presentation.\nHe explains that specifically,\nthe most attractive physical\nfeatures fall under self-care.\nThings like good grooming, clean hair,\nnice-fitting and quality clothing,\ngood posture, and healthy weight.\nNicholson concludes that\nthese self-care features\nare attractive because they indicate\nhow we're managing our\nhealth and well-being,\nwhich demonstrates our potential value\nas a partner and mate.\nNumber five, crack jokes often.\nAre you the class clown?\nCan you be humorous sometimes?\nWell, a good joke here and\nthere can go a long way.\nApparently, when it comes to romance too.\nResearchers from Illinois State University\nand DePaul University found in their study\nthat when you use humor\nwhen getting to know an\nacquaintance at first,\nthat individual has a better\nchance of liking you more.\nThey even found that engaging\nin funny tasks may raise\nromantic attraction.\nAnd number six, being kind.\nDo you have a habit of being kind?\nDoing the right thing?\nWell, keep it up.\nWho doesn't love some kindness?\nIt's always a good thing\nto be kind to one another.\nBut one study from China also suggests\nthat it may just make you appear\nmore physically attractive.\nThis study had three subject\ngroups examine pictures\nof people's faces, and rate\nhow attractive they were.\nOne group was given\npersonality information\nthat was positive,\nwhile others were given\nnegative information or none.\nThe group given positive\npersonality information\nrated the faces as more\nattractive than the others.\nThis study finds that positive personality\ncan increase perceptions\nof facial attractiveness,\nand that this phenomenon of halo effect\non facial attractiveness\nhas been evidenced.\nSo while we should all\nbe kind no matter what,\nit's a nice bonus to know it may pay off\nin more ways than we think.\nNot only will we make others feel good\nand feel healthier and happier ourselves,\nbut we may just appear\nmore physically attractive than before.\nSo which habits do you have?\nDo you hope to practice\nsome of these habits?\nWhich ones?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching."
