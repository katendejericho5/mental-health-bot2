    "transcript": "(gentle pensive music)\n(camera whirring)\n- Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to our channel.\nHave you ever wondered if\nyour father was a narcissist?\nA narcissistic father sees\nany attempt for independence\nas a threat, diminishing\ntheir child's sense of self\nand coercing them to comply\nwith inflexible requests.\nTypically, any form of\nhealthy and unconditional love\nis absent as well.\nWith that said, here are six\nsigns of a narcissistic father.\nNumber one, they live through their child.\nDoes your father set expectations\nto fulfill his own unmet needs and dreams?\nAll fathers want their\nchildren to be successful\nand good human beings.\nHowever, some fathers\nsupport their children\nas a means to continue the legacy\nthat they have failed\nto build up years ago.\nHe places himself into the child's shoes\nand forces them to do things his way,\nwhich in turn can blur\nthe child's identity\nand make it feel as if they're\nan extension to his whims,\nrather than an independent human being\nwith their own beliefs and dreams.\nNumber two, they put their child down.\nDoes your father throw off-handed remarks\nthat always make you feel worse?\nSome fathers tie their self-esteem\nto their superiority in the household,\nand having their child\nchallenge their position\ncan threaten them.\nIn those cases, the father may try\nto put their child down\nthrough nitpicking,\ncomparing them to others,\nand emotional invalidation\nin order to maintain their superiority\nand protect their self-esteem.\nThis can also come out and phrases like,\n\"You'll never succeed without me,\"\nor, \"You're not worth\nour hard-earned money.\"\nNumber three, parade the\nimage of their child.\nDoes he boast about your accomplishments\nto make others envious?\nIt's normal to feel pride in\nyour child's accomplishments,\nwhether it's in school,\nsports, or relationships,\nbut if the intent of the father\nis to put down the other\nparents' accomplishments,\nand talk about how special\nand envy-worthy you are,\nthis can be a sign of narcissism at work.\nIt's like saying, \"Look how special I am,\nand how you are not.\"\nNumber four, constant manipulation.\nDoes your father guilt-trip you\nwhen you try to set a boundary?\nManipulation comes in many forms,\nfrom shaming, emotional coercion,\nto manipulative threats of cutting ties.\nNarcissistic fathers weaponize love,\nand only give it on occasion,\ninstead of healthy expression\nas a natural emotion.\nThis unhealthy parenting can\nbe disorienting to the child,\ncausing them to have a\ndistorted view of love\nand developing unhealthy attachment styles\nin their future relationships.\nNumber five, dependency.\nDoes he force you to make sacrifices\nwhile disregarding your own needs?\nA narcissistic father feels\nas if their child owes them something,\nwhether it's financial,\nemotional, or physical.\nThis could entail the child\nto make great sacrifices\nwithout regard for their\nown needs and priorities.\nIf the child says no, the\nfather could retaliate\nby guilt-tripping and\nsaying something like,\n\"Oh, so you don't love me anymore.\nAfter all I've done to help you?\"\nIn those cases, it's best to\nstay firm on your boundaries\nand communicate your side of the story.\nIt might not always change\nhis mind, but you can\nat least say you've done\nall you can and move on.\nAnd number six, neglect.\nIs your father too involved\nin his career or personal life\nwith little time set aside for you?\nA narcissistic father can\nfind the idea of child raising\nto be too much to bear,\nleaving it to his spouse.\nHe might be so absorbed with his work life\nthat he forgets to set aside time\nto foster a relationship with his child,\nwhich can cause the child to\ndevelop self-esteem issues\nand a slew of other\nmental health problems.\nSo do you see your father\nin any of these signs?\nBeing raised by a narcissist\ncan have big impacts\non your mental health,\nbut remember that you're not alone.\nThere are resources out there to help you\nwith your journey towards recovery.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike, and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the resources used\nare added in the description box below.\nThank you for watching.
