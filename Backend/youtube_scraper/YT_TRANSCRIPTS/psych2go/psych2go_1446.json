    "transcript": "(calm music)\n- Hey, Psych2Goers,\nhave you ever wondered when to label\na relationship as toxic?\nWe might think the red\nflags are clear as day,\nrecent surveys actually\nreport the opposite.\nAccording to the Center for\nDisease Control and Prevention,\none out of every three teens\nwill experience being in\nan unhealthy relationship,\nbut only 33% of them will seek help\nor confide in someone else about it.\nWhy?\nIn the words of American\nauthor Bryant McGill,\n\"Escaping a toxic relationship\ncan feel like breaking\noff a piece of your heart.\nLeaving is never easy, but\nsometimes it is necessary\nto save yourself and\nothers from dying inside.\"\nIt's difficult to accept when\nthe people we love the most\nare actually the ones\nhurting us the worst.\nEven the strongest of us\ncan find ourselves trapped\nin a toxic relationship, unable to accept\nwhen things have already\ncrashed and burned.\nBut knowing how to tell when things\nare starting to take a turn for the worst\ncan save you a lot of\nheartache down the road\nand may even help you\nsave your relationship\nbefore it's too late.\nSo with that said,\nhere are some telltale signs\nof a toxic relationship.\nNumber one, you don't feel any support.\nDo you feel your relationship\nhas started to lose its spark?\nAre you worried you're not\nfeeling much of an effort anymore\nfrom your partner?\nNot only have they stopped making plans\nand checking in with you regularly,\nbut they've stopped\nshowing you any support\nor encouragement as well.\nThey're not there for\nyou when you need them,\nbut they make you feel like\nit's your fault somehow.\nThat it's your own goals and ambitions\ngetting in the way of your relationship\nand not their lack of\nappreciation and commitment.\nNumber two, you don't\ncommunicate with each other.\nDo you and your partner treat each other\nwith sarcasm a lot lately?\nAre criticism, thinly veiled judgment,\nand passive aggression a\npart of your daily routine?\nYou can't go two minutes\nwithout losing your patience\nor getting annoyed at one another.\nAnd most conversations\nquickly turn into fights.\nYou don't talk to them\nabout what's bothering you\nbecause you feel like\nthey wouldn't understand,\nor they'd just get mad at you about it.\nSo instead of being honest and open\nabout how you really feel,\nyou choose the silent ground.\nYou're under so much pressure\nto act perfect all the time\nfor their sake that it feels exhausting\njust spending time with them.\nAccording to statistics, only\na small percentage of you\nwho watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nIf you're not subscribed yet\nand you enjoy what you see,\ndo consider hitting the subscribe button.\nThis encourages YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content\nto more people out there.\nNumber three, there's a lot of jealousy.\nAlways practice caution when\nbuying into the dangerous idea\nthat a partner's jealousy\ncomes from a place of love.\nJealousy is not born out of\nlove, but out of attachment.\nThe desire to possess someone\nand keep them all to yourself.\nAnd jealousy can inspire a lot of toxic\nand controlling behaviors\nin a relationship,\nlike invading your\nsignificant other's privacy,\ngoing through their messages,\nand policing who they can\nand can't be friends with.\nNumber four, there's\na built up resentment.\nHave you and your partner\never gotten into a fight\nthat brought up a lot of past issues\nand mistakes you thought\nwere already resolved?\nThis happens because there's\na lot of built up resentment\nin your relationship.\nYour partner hasn't forgiven\nyou for what you did wrong\nand you haven't let go of all the ways\nthey hurt you before either.\nYou're both holding onto\ngrudges and refusing to move on,\nusing those mistakes\nto guilt trip, control,\nand manipulate one another instead.\nBut healthy relationships\naren't about keeping score\nand focusing on all the\nthings you've done wrong.\nEven the kindest, most loving people\ncan do hurtful things sometimes,\nbut it's no use holding\nit against them forever.\nNumber five, you feel disrespected.\nDo they interrupt you or talk\nover you without concern?\nAre they making you the\nbutt of a lot of jokes?\nIf they casually tell people your secrets\nand personal details,\nand are late to most dates\nor a no-show altogether,\nthings might be progressing\ntowards the red zone.\nThey may also belittle\nyour problems and concerns\nand decide things for you\nwithout considering your\nfeelings or opinions.\nThese are just a few\nexamples of all the ways\nyou may be disrespected\nby your significant other,\nbut all of them are definite red flags.\nBecause at the end of the day,\nthey're all just telling\nus the same thing,\nyour partner doesn't value\nor treat you as equals.\nAnd number six, you don't have\ntime for other relationships.\nIn the beginning, you wanted\nto spend most of your time\nwith your significant other, right?\nBut as time went on and your relationship\ngot more and more serious,\nyou became more comfortable\nbeing apart from them\nbecause you feel secure\nwith the commitment\nyou've made to one another.\nBut it's not like that when\nyou're in a toxic relationship.\nIn a toxic relationship,\nyour partner becomes your entire world.\nAll you do is spend time with\nthem and follow them around.\nYou start to lose yourself\nin them and end up neglecting\nall of your other important\nrelationships in your life,\nespecially with yourself.\nAs they say, the first step\nto overcoming a problem\nis by acknowledging it.\nAnd the good news is just\nbecause your relationship\nhas turned toxic now,\nit doesn't mean you and your\npartner are doomed for good.\nAs long as the two of you\nacknowledge these toxic traits\nand are both willing to\nchange for the better,\nthen there's still hope.\nPracticing more open communication,\nshifting from playing the\nblame game to understanding,\nand establishing healthy boundaries\ncan be helpful in moving forward.\nOf course, toxic relationships\naren't the same as abusive relationships.\nIf you or anyone you\nknow is being physically\nor emotionally abused by their partner,\nplease reach out to the authorities\nor any of the many organizations available\nto get the help you need.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto how relationships might turn toxic.\nWhat do you think of the signs mentioned?\nDo any of these describe your experiences?\nDo you think your\nrelationship has turned toxic?\nLeave a comment down below\nand please feel free to share\nany thoughts you have as well.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it\nwith those
