    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nHave you noticed how\nrelationships change over time?\nThe course of a relationship\nis like a river.\nWe all fall in love differently.\nSome relationships start with an obstacle.\nOthers start with distance.\nWhether or not you've started dating\nor have been married for years,\nyou can experience the following phases,\nin no specific order.\nSo with that said, here are\nfive phases of a relationship.\nNumber one, the meeting.\nIn every romantic film this\nis the part where you meet.\nIn this phase there's attraction.\nYou're not really sure what\ndraws you to that person\nbut you are interested.\nSo you fall into conversation\nand start getting\nto know the basics of each other.\nJob, hobbies, et cetera.\nThere's little to no emotional\nintimacy at this point.\nBut the meeting stage\nencompasses the entire time\nyou two get to know each other.\nThe casual dates and so on.\nDuring this time you both scope out\nwhether it's worth\ndeveloping this relationship.\nThis is when the, \"What\nare we?\" Question pops up.\nThe answer determines whether\nyou develop a relationship\nor part ways.\nAre

honeymoon phase.\nA relationship begins after\nthe getting to know you phase\nand you've decided to\nenter into a relationship.\nYou're both starting to\nopen up and be vulnerable.\nFun dates will evolve\ninto intimate dinners\nand long conversations.\nOxytocin, dopamine and endorphin levels\nin your body will increase and you'll want\nto spend every second with that person.\nThe honeymoon phase is characterized\nby deep feelings of infatuation\nand the desire to be together.\nBoundaries will fall away\nand lead to deeper emotional\nand physical intimacy.\nBut basking in each other's love\ncan make you both ignore the realities\nof who you really are.\nDuring this phase we all\ntend to idealize our partners\nand sometimes ignore red flags.\nThree, doubts.\nAfter the honeymoon\nyou're met with reality.\nDuring this stage some of\nthe traits you found enduring\nor attractive seize to\ncaptivate your heart.\nYou'll also start to notice differences\nbetween the two of you\nand you may begin to feel distant.\nThis is the phase that\nsometimes end relationships.\nYour expectation of your partner\ndoesn't match who they are.\nYou both may begin feeling\nstressed and start to clash.\nYour stress response may\ndictate how things will play out\nin this phase.\nSome pick fights to\nestablish their dominance\nwhile others withdraw.\nThe best course of action is to work\non conflict management.\nLearn how to deescalate problems\nand tackle challenges head on as a team.\nConflicts don't have to spell\nthe end of a relationship.\nIt just means that you both\nhave different perspectives\nand ideas.\nYou both need to respect and learn to show\nthat you love each other.\nFour, disillusionment.\nAt this point the conflicts and issues\nthat have arisen throughout\nthe relationship are\non the table.\nThe passion you both felt\nduring the early stages has disappeared\nand neither of you know if the\nrelationship should continue.\nBut what you choose to do in this stage\ndetermines the longevity\nof your relationship.\nSome couples choose to ignore them\nand continue to grow distant.\nOthers fight and eventually\nexhaust themselves.\nHowever, this phase is not the end\nand can serve as an opportunity\nfor you and your partner\nto renew the commitment\nyou have for each other and\nchange how things currently are.\nAll the fighting could\nmake you both reluctant\nto showing each other affection,\nbut do it anyway and show your partner\nthat you appreciate them.\nAnd that you're glad that\nthey're in your life.\nOur minds tend to focus\non negative things,\nso you could miss out on all the reasons\nthat your relationship is worth saving.\nAnd number five, decision.\nThis is the climax of the movie\nand of the relationship\nbecause this is the part where you decide\nwhether to stay or leave.\nYou may feel like no matter\nhow hard you both try,\nthe relationship doesn't\nfeel like it used to.\nThings feel stale and you\nno longer see your partner\nas the person you fell in love with.\nYou contemplate leaving and starting again\nwith someone else.\nBut no matter how many times\nyou've played in your mind\nhow you're going to dump them,\nsomething keeps you from doing it.\nIf you choose to stay,\nyou need to be willing\nto work on your relationship.\nThis means learning how\nto communicate effectively\nand understanding your role.\nThis is where you both learn how to love.\nWe all say \"I love you\" and feel love.\nBut we rarely learn how to love.\nLove is a choice that does not change,\nregardless of the phase\nyour relationship is in.\nIf you and your partner need help,\nplease reach out to a licensed\nrelationship councilor\nor therapist.\nCan you relate to any of these phases?\nLet us know in the comments\nand please share this video with someone\nwho might benefit.\nAs always, the references\nand studies are listed\nin the description below.\nWe'll see you next time.\nTake care."
