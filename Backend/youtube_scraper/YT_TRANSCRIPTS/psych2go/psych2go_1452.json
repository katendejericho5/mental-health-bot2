    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you ever wonder\nif your relationship with your partner\nis a healthy one?\nMaybe you know it is,\nand sometimes it feels like\nit was simply destined to be.\nYou ask yourself,\n\"Was this meant to be?\"\nWell, here are six signs your relationship\nwas indeed really meant to be.\nNumber one, you work\ntogether on some things.\nHow often do you work together\nwith your partner\non certain things?\nMaybe you work together\non a project for your home,\nor maybe you give them advice and feedback\non something they're working on.\nIf the both of you work with each other\nand look out for both of your needs,\nyou likely have a pretty\nstrong relationship.\nA good partner will be your biggest fan.\nThey'll cheer you on,\nand may try things\nthey've never done before\nall because they love you.\nThey wanna support you.\nIf your partner is supportive\nand you're supportive of them,\nthen this is a healthy sign.\nNumber two, you share\nthe same kind of humor.\nDo you and your partner\nhave the same kind\nof sense of humor?\nHumor can be a great tool for bonding.\nIf you and your partner\nshare inside jokes\nand crack each other up often,\nthen this is a good sign\nyour relationship is on the right track.\nYou may laugh at the same kinds of jokes,\nor perhaps you enjoy\nthe same comedy movies.\nBut if you find yourself\nlaughing with your partner\nmore than you usually do,\nthis could be yet another sign\nthat it is meant to be.\nNumber three, you can't help\nbut think of your partner\nwhen you're not around them.\nWhen you're away from your partner,\ndo you often still think of them?\nYou miss them\nand you can't wait to see them again.\nThis can be a sign\nyour love is especially strong.\nA study from researchers\nat Stony Brook University\nfound that how much you\nthink about your partner may reflect\nhow much more in love you feel.\nThe study states,\n\"Importantly, correlates\nof long-term intense love,\n\"as predicted by theory,\n\"were thinking positively\nabout the partner\n\"and thinking about\nthe partner when apart.\n\"Affectionate behaviors\nand sexual intercourse,\n\"shared novel and challenging activities,\n\"and general life happiness.\"\nParticipants who stated\nthat they thought about their partner\nwhen away from them\nwere found to have said\nthey felt more in love as well.\nMakes sense, right?\nSo if you find yourself\nthinking about your partner\nwhen you're not around them,\nit could be a symptom of true love.\nAnd speaking of things meant to be,\nif you often forget\nto make a cup of coffee\nin the morning\nor are frustrated\nby the selection at your grocery store,\nyou'll love our sponsor for this video.\nTrade Coffee.\nA service dedicated to helping you\nget the finest coffee\nfrom the best roasters in the nation,\nand for a limited time.\nin order to match you\nwith the best selection of coffee,\nTrade has an incredibly\neffective process in place.\nFirst, you take a quiz\nso Trade knows\nwhat kind of coffee you like best\nand to pick your ideal type.\nNext, you choose your delivery frequency\nso that you receive\nyour cup of coffee when you want\nand at peak freshness.\nAfter that, you can rate your matches\nso that Trade can continue to deliver you\nthe best coffee there\nis to match your tastes.\nOne of my favorite things about Trade\nis that they work with local roasters\nin order to deliver\nyou high quality coffee\nwithin 24 hours of roasting.\nNothing tastes better than knowing\nthat you're supporting\nsmall businesses in your community.\nAnd more importantly,\nthey also ship all of their products\nin completely compostable packaging.\nWith high quality coffee being shipped\nin environmentally friendly packaging,\nyou won't regret trying Trade.\nAnd if you're looking\nfor that perfect festive gift\nfor the coffee lover,\nTrade's got your holidays covered.\nOne of the best gifts you could give\nIs a personalized coffee subscription.\nWith Trade's wide selection\nof brands to choose from,\neven the choosiest coffee fan\nwill find something that they like.\nStill not sure?\nTrade has got you covered.\nIf you don't like your first coffee,\nthey'll ship you a different bag for free.\nThat is their first match guarantee.\nAnd right now,\nanyone who takes the quiz\nin the description below\nwill also receive $15 off\ntheir first three bags\nand will have no shipping fees.\nSo take the quiz today.\nNumber four, respect for each other.\nDo you respect your partner?\nDo they respect you?\nThis is a sign of a healthy relationship.\nClinical psychologist Franklin A. Porter\nexplains that true\nrespect for your partner\nis when your partner understands\nand accepts that you are,\nfirst and foremost,\na unique individual.\nBasically, you're your own person,\nand you have your own desires, needs,\nand things going on in your life.\nIt's not always a combo\npack type of situation.\nNumber five, you communicate\nwell with each other.\nDo you communicate with your partner?\nAre you honest and open\nabout your feelings?\nThis is extremely important\nfor a healthy relationship.\nNot only should you open up\nto your partner about\nwhat you're truly feeling\nor any concerns you may have too,\nbut you should also actively listen\nto what they're telling you\nabout themselves as well.\nCommunicate honestly\nand listen genuinely,\nthen your relationship\nmay be set on the right path.\nAnd number six, you trust each other.\nOf course, trust.\nAsk yourself, how much do\nyou trust your partner?\nIf you've been with your partner a while\nand you know they're there for you\nwhen times get tough,\nand have always been honest,\nyou likely trust them.\nBut if you find yourself questioning\ntheir behaviors or intentions,\nit's a good idea to ask yourself why.\nDo you not trust them\nbecause of a past behavior of theirs,\nor maybe an experience\nfrom your previous relationships?\nIt may be a good idea to sit down\nand discuss why you may be having\ndifficulty trusting them or them you,\nbecause building trust is definitely\nan important aspect\nof any healthy relationship.\nAnd if it's meant to be,\nyou'll find the trust is really there,\nas much as your love for each other.\nSo do you think your relationship\nwas meant to be?\nHow often do you think of your partner\nwhen away from them?\nNo, they don't need to be\non your mind all the time.\nBut if you miss them,\nit's likely you have strong love.\nPerhaps you two were really\nmeant to be after all.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did,\ndon't forget to click the Like button\nand share it with a\nfriend or your partner.\nSubscribed to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always,\nthanks for watching."
