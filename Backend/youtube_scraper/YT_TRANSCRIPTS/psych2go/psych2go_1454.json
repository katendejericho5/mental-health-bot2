    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nand welcome back to another video.\nIf you're new here, welcome to Psych2Go.\nCan you think of some\nqualities that society\nin general values very highly in people?\nSelflessness, perseverance,\nrespect, commitment,\nloyalty, amongst others.\nEach of these qualities\nis extremely important\nfor the development of society,\nbut it can be argued\nthat the most important\nand sought-after quality is honesty.\nYou might think that\nhonest people can be found\nat every turn on the street,\nbut studies have shown\nthat 40% of adults lie\nat least once a day.\nWait, what?\nAnd although most of these accounts are\nfor small white lies,\nit still counts as dishonest behavior.\nThis makes honest people\nthat much rarer and valuable.\nSo here are seven revealing\ntraits that honest people have.\nNumber one, you have strong beliefs.\nHow strongly do you defend your beliefs?\nEven when these are a part of a minority,\nstanding by your beliefs\nand not being afraid\nto share them with others\nare traits that you have\nas an honest person,\nyou are not afraid to go against the trend\nand you'll not change what your opinion is\nsimply because other\npeople think differently.\nNumber two, you are thick skinned.\nDon't take this the wrong way.\nHere defining thick skinned is important.\nThick skinned refers to a\nperson who is insensitive\nor hardened to criticism,\nreproach, rebuff, et cetera.\nYes, really.\nSo how well do you handle\ncriticism from others?\nAre you someone who will feel down\nafter being criticized once?\nAs an honest person,\nyou'll often tell people\nthings as they are.\nAnd of course, people who don't like\nwhat they hear will get\ndefensive and come back at you\nwith insults or whatnot.\nAnd this is why honest people\ntend to be thick-skinned,\nto prevent being affected\nby other people's defensive responses.\nNumber three, you have a calm\nand consistent voice tone.\nHave you ever noticed someone constantly\nraising their voice tone\nthroughout a conversation.\nThat is a dead giveaway\nthat someone is lying.\nAs an honest person,\nyou maintain a calm and\nconsistent voice tone\nwhen talking with others,\nthis is because you're not afraid of\nwhat people might ask you.\nEven when they're trying to accuse you,\nyou reply calmly while maintaining\na consistent voice tone,\nbecause you don't have anything to hide.\nNumber four, you don't\ncare about popularity.\nHow much importance do you place\non other people's opinions of you?\nIf your answer is not much,\nthen this might be one of\nyour personality traits\nas an honest person.\nYou're not interested in\nbeing admired as the smartest\nor most attractive or most interesting\nbecause you know that\nit's probably not true.\nYou don't wish to waste\nyour time and energy\nconvincing people of things like that.\nSimilarly, whenever you do good deeds,\nyou do them because you want to help.\nAfter all doing good deeds\nonly to become more popular\ncan be seen as fake\nand completely goes against your beliefs.\nNumber five, you can come across as rude.\nAre you someone who's not\nafraid to tell the truth\nto people, even if it might hurt them?\nAs an honest person,\none of your main traits is\nthat you would rather tell\nsomeone the hurtful truth\nthan a pleasant lie.\nBecause of this, and\nconsidering that again,\nsome people don't like\nthe reality of things,\nyou might come across as rude,\nor like a person who doesn't care\nabout other people's feelings.\nBut in the end, even when\npeople think you're rude,\nremember that you don't have ill intent.\nYou're just being honest with them.\nAnd most of the time\npeople will come across\nand acknowledge that.\nNumber six, you have close,\nmeaningful relationships.\nHow easy is it for you to build meaningful\nand strong relationships?\nAs an honest person,\nyou'll find yourself\nsurrounded by close friends,\nafter all a strong and\nlasting relationship\nbases itself on trust and honesty.\nWould you rather be a close friend\nto someone who gossips behind your back\nor someone who confronts\nyou when there's a problem?\nYou'll most likely prefer\nsomeone who's open and honest\nabout problems.\nAnd most people will\nhave the same preference\ntowards honest people.\nThis is why you're able to form close\nand meaningful relationships.\nAnd number seven, your\nmovements are natural.\nSometimes the most obvious signs\nthat people can give are not verbal.\nHave you ever talked with someone\nwhose body movement just didn't\nmatch what they were saying?\nSimilar to how you talk with a calm\nand consistent voice tone.\nYou also move your body in a\nrelaxed and natural manner.\nNatural movements are obvious signals\nthat you're not afraid of getting exposed,\nor that you have nothing to hide.\nOn the other hand,\nsomeone who is lying will\nusually have a stiffer\nand more unnatural movement.\nSo feeling completely relaxed when talking\nand having your body language show that\nis one of the traits of an honest person.\nTo conclude, honest people\nare harder to come across\nthan you might think.\nBut if you do, or if one\nof the friends you know\nhave these traits that\nhave been described,\nyou can move forward,\nknowing yourself better,\nas well as being able to tell\nhonest people surrounding you\napart from people who will lie to you.\nWe hope we are able to\ngive you some insight\ninto some of the traits of honest people.\nDo any of these
