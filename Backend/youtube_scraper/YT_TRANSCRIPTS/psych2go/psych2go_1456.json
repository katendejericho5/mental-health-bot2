    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello,\nPsych2Goers, welcome back.\nOkay, so a highly\nsensitive person, or HSP,\nisn't just someone who's really sensitive\nbut rather someone with a\nheightened central nervous system\nthat causes them to be more physically\nand emotionally responsive\nto certain stimuli\nor the things in their surroundings.\nHSPs are attentive,\nempathetic, and creative.\nHowever, just like anyone else,\nHSPs also have some\nnegative traits as well.\nKeep in mind that this video\nserves as a general guidance,\npurely for educational purposes,\nand is not to be taken as a substitute\nfor professional advice or assistance\nor as an attack on your character.\nBut with that said,\nhere are some of the more negative traits\nof highly sensitive people.\nNumber one, HSPs are critical.\nBeing so in tune with their thoughts\nand feelings makes HSPs\npensive, deep thinkers,\nbut it can also cause them\nto be or seem critical\ntowards others and even\ntowards themselves.\nGenerally, being critical isn't\nsomething HSPs purposefully\nor intentionally do.\nBecause of their constant pondering\nand deep processing of information,\nthey easily form different ideas\nand opinions in their head,\nwhich they might choose to voice\nin response to someone else's\ndifferent ideas or opinions.\nAs for criticism aimed at themselves,\nthrough all the time HSPs spend reflecting\nand replaying memories in their heads,\nit can be very easy for\nthem to criticize themselves\nfor mistakes they've made or\npast actions they now regret.\nDoing so can involve negative self-talk\nand berating thoughts like,\n\"Oh, I should've done this instead,\"\nor \"How stupid of me to do that!\"\nNumber two, HSPs can be moody.\nOne of the most noticeable qualities\nthat HSPs have is their\nability to feel emotions\non a deeper level than most.\nWhile a non-HSP might not get too giddy\nover seeing a butterfly,\nan HSP might find themselves in awe\nbecause its color is unique\nor feel nostalgic because it\nreminds them of ones they used\nto see a lot during their childhood.\nHowever, on the flip side,\njust as HSPs can feel positive emotions\nmore easily and deeply,\nthe same applies to negative\nemotions like sadness,\nirritability, or guilt,\nwhich they can fall\nvictim to within seconds,\ndespite how they were\nfeeling moments before.\nNot to confuse or characterize\nthem as being bipolar,\nbut because of their more\nsensitive, large-scaled emotions,\nHSPs don't have the same\nemotional regulation\nas most people.\nNumber three, HSPs are emotional sponges.\nHSPs are people who are\nvery emotionally responsive\nto their environment and surroundings,\nwhich includes other\npeople's emotions as well.\nWhether it's dealing with a boss\nthat woke up on the wrong side of the bed\nor even simply being around someone\nin a particularly bad mood,\nother people's emotions\ncan rub off on HSPs\nand turn their mood sour as well.\nThis can be quite inconvenient\nand frustrating for HSPs\nbecause it can completely ruin a good day.\nThis quality of being\nemotionally absorbent ties in\nwith their tendency to\nhave quick changes in mood,\nas other people's emotions\ncan play a huge part\nin dictating an HSP's current mood.\nNumber four, HSPs are easily overwhelmed.\nAnother weakness HSPs face\ndue to their sensitivity\nis that they're more prone\nto feeling overwhelmed\nin situations.\nThese feelings can be caused\nby common everyday occurrences\nlike loud noises,\nreceiving a large workload,\nand even just being in a messy room.\nSmall stimuli like this\ncan set off receptors\nin an HSP's brain and become\ntriggers for their stress,\nmaking them feel mentally\nand even physically drained.\nSigns of becoming overwhelmed\ninclude a loss of concentration,\npanic, a short temper, and headaches.\nFeeling overwhelmed isn't always a storm\nthat's quick to pass for an HSP,\nand it can become a bigger problem\nwhen it disrupts productivity\nat school or work.\nAs a result, this change\nin pace for an HSP can lead\nto feelings of inadequacy and guilt\nfor not being able to focus\nor function as well as they want to,\nand can even lead to burnout.\nNumber five, HSPs can have\ndifficulty setting boundaries.\nSetting boundaries in any\nrelationship is a must,\nwhether it's our friendships\nor our romantic partner.\nBoundaries allow us to draw the line\nbetween what actions we are\nand aren't comfortable with\nfrom other people.\nHowever, for HSPs,\nsome may have difficulty setting\nand maintaining boundaries.\nThis is because HSPs are considerate,\nbut sometimes too much for their own good.\nThey're wary of other people's emotions\nand are the type of people that\nwouldn't want to put others\nin uncomfortable situations or hurt them\nby speaking up about\ncertain actions they do.\nAs a result, they may choose\nto sweep these actions\nunder the rug and avoid\nconfronting other people's behavior\nin order to keep the peace.\nKeeping quiet about these\nproblems can result in tension\nwithin the relationship,\nan HSP being taken advantage of,\nand can lead to future\narguments in the relationship\nif their current concerns\neventually evolve\ninto bigger problems.\nAnd number six, HSPs can be\ninsecure over their sensitivity.\nWe all know what it's like to be insecure.\nInsecurity is a common human experience\nthat HSPs can also fall victim to,\nparticularly over how they are as a person\nand over their quality\nof being more sensitive.\nIn short, HSPs can\nstruggle with insecurity\nfor being a highly sensitive person.\nAnd this might be because\nthey've experienced humiliation\nor being questioned for why\nthey are the way they are,\nespecially if they showed\nsigns of sensitivity\nwhen they were younger.\nAs a result, it's common for\nHSPs to be negatively labeled\nas emotional, quiet, or introverted.\nBeing questioned or criticized\nfor their sensitivity\ncan make it seem like a flaw in character,\nand this can manifest\ninto an HSP's insecurity\nor feeling like they don't belong,\nwhich can impact their self-esteem\nand follow them as they grow older.\nSo did this give you some insight\ninto the negative traits of an HSP?\nJust as with all people,\neveryone has their strengths\nand weaknesses that make up who we are.\nFor HSPs, their sensitivity\nand attentiveness can be\nviewed as almost a sixth sense,\nbut can cause some downsides.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it
