    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello, Psych2Goers.\nDid you know with the recent movement\non mental health awareness\nover the past few years\npeople are gradually coming\nto understand more and more\nabout matters of depression, anxiety,\ntrauma, and other mental disorders?\nThere's also less stigma\nsurrounding the need for therapy\nand mental health care nowadays,\nthanks to the countless public figures\nwho have bravely spoken up\nabout their own struggles\nwith mental illness.\nDo any of your favorite\ncelebrities come to mind?\nStill, there remains a lot unknown\nabout the true nature of depression,\nthe world's most common mental illness.\nAnd even more, it's only\nthose struggling with it\nthat can truly understand.\nSo, with that said, here are 10 things\nonly depressed people will understand.\nNumber one, difficulty with\ncommunicating your emotions.\nWithin the depths of depression,\nthere may reside complex emotions\nsuch as sadness,\nhopelessness, helplessness,\nanger, fear, shame, and guilt.\nFurther still, depression might manifest\nas an unending sense of emotional\nnumbness and desolation.\nEither way, putting\nyour feelings into words\nand communicating them with others\nis a constant struggle\nwhen you're depressed,\nespecially when loved ones\nare asking you how you feel\nor how you're doing because\nthey suspect something is wrong.\nYou don't want them to worry.\nBut when you're in the\nclutches of depression,\nyou just don't know what\nor even how to tell them.\nNumber two, the guilt of not having\na \"good reason\" for being depressed.\n\"Well, why are you depressed?\n\"What do you even have\nto be depressed about\n\"in the first place?\"\nSound familiar?\nPerhaps one of the most difficult things\nabout having depression\nis the pain of being\nmisunderstood or judged.\nDo you agree depression needs\nto have a tangible reason?\nThough you understand that depression\nis something that affects\npeople of all ages,\ngenders, races, classes,\nand social backgrounds,\nyou still can't help but feel\nguilty when others judge you\nfor not having a good\nreason for being depressed.\nNumber three, the anger\nover constantly being told,\n\"I understand.\"\nDo you find it hard to believe\nwhen others say they understand\nwhat you're going through?\nAnother thing not talked about enough\nwhen it comes to depression\nis how frustrating it can feel\nto constantly be told by\nothers that they understand\nwhen really all you wanna do is tell them\nthat unless they've been diagnosed\nwith depression themselves\nand been inside your mind,\nno, they really don't.\nJust because they've\nfelt really sad sometimes\nor this terrible thing happened\nto them once upon a time\ndoes not mean that they know how it feels\nto have clinical depression.\nNumber four, the pain of losing your love\nand passion for life.\nHow long has it been since\nyou picked up a paintbrush\nor strummed a tune?\nThe American Psychological Association\nstates that the defining\nfeature of clinical depression\nis markedly diminished\ninterest or pleasure\nin all or most all activities.\nSimply put,\nthis means that when you're\nsuffering from depression,\nit's a struggle for you\nto find joy or enjoyment,\neven in the hobbies and activities\nthat you once loved so much.\nIt makes you lose passion for life.\nDepression makes you\nunable to feel motivated\nto do anything anymore,\nand so it robs you of even the\nsimplest of life's pleasures.\nNumber five, the frustration\nof not being able\nto just snap out of it.\nHave you been told that a few days\nof rest and relaxation\ncan cure depression?\nOne of the many reasons why depression\nis such a devastating mental illness\nis that a lot of people\ndon't really understand\nits true nature.\nThey think that people who are depressed\ncan just snap out of it\nor just need to think more positively.\nThere is no built in switch for this.\nYour feelings are every\nbit as real as they feel.\nYou're not obligated to feel any other way\njust because others don't feel the same.\nNumber six, the compulsive\ndesire to self-isolate.\nWhy do counselors and therapists alike\nstress the need for those\nstruggling with depression\nto have a good social support system?\nEven though you understand the need\nto be surrounded by supportive loved ones,\nthe truth is when you're depressed\nyou'll most likely feel\na compulsive desire\nto isolate yourself from others.\nWith no energy or motivation\nto engage in social interactions,\nyou tend to prefer isolation.\nConstant difficulty with communicating\nfinding enjoyment in\nthings leads to struggling\nwith feelings of low\nself-esteem and self-worth.\nTalking to people and staying in touch\ncan often feel too overwhelming\nwhen you're struggling with depression,\ntriggering a need to withdraw\nfrom society in general.\nNumber seven, people thinking depression\nis the same as sadness.\nSadness is a part of a healthy\nspectrum of human emotions\nand is actually quite normal\nto feel from time to time.\nDepression, on the other hand,\nis a serious and\ndebilitating mental illness\nthat needs to be treated with\nprofessional help and therapy.\nThese things are not all the same,\nand yet some people just can't\nseem to grasp the difference.\nThis can often feel very frustrating,\nespecially when others\ndisregard what you're feeling\nas mere sadness and tell\nyou not to think about it.\nNumber eight, people not understanding\nthat mental illness is real.\nMany people still seem\nto think that depression\nis a choice and mental illness isn't real.\nBut just because there are no\nphysical manifestations to see\ndoesn't mean that the\nsuffering you feel is not real.\nIt's not just in your head.\nIf you're able to feel it,\nthen it is very much real.\nWhen others downplay its potency,\nit often leaves you feeling\nas if you're doing something wrong.\nAs a result, you may even choose\nto remain silent about it instead.\nNumber nine, people thinking depression\nis the same for everybody.\nEvery individual's experience\nof a mental disorder is different.\nDepression doesn't look\nthe same for everybody.\nSome people might stop eating\nand struggle with insomnia,\nwhile others might overeat and oversleep.\nSome people have\nhigh-functioning depression\nand may not even seem like\nthey're struggling at all.\nAnd for others, their\ndepression might force them\nto lie in bed all day and do nothing.\nNevertheless, all experiences\nof depression are valid.\nAnd number 10, learning to\ncelebrate the little things.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nwhen you struggle with depression,\neven the littlest of victories\ndeserves to be celebrated.\nGot outta bed today?\nSmile.\nManaged a short conversation with someone.\nTook the time to brush\nyour hair or take a bath?\nGive yourself a mental pat on the back.\nThose are all very, very\nimportant achievements\nto someone with depression.\nThey might not mean much to other people.\nBut for you, struggling\nwith mental illness\non an everyday basis,\nthey make up the good days\nthat remind you why you\nneed to keep fighting\nand why it's so important\nto keep holding on.\nIt's important to remember\nnot to allow others\nto dictate how you should feel.\nJust because others are\nnot feeling the same\ndoes not make it any less real.\nThere's no need to cover up\nor force yourself to\nchange these feelings.\nThe fact that you're feeling it\nis reason enough to validate it.\nIf you are struggling with depression\nor any other mental illness,\nplease know that there\nis always hope and help\nand that someday things can be better.\nSeeking professional help\ncan help you on the road to improvement.\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your experience\nwith depression if you'd like.\nPlease feel
