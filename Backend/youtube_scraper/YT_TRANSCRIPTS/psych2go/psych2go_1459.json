    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHas anyone ever told you that\nthey find you intimidating\nor difficult to approach?\nOr have you ever wondered\nwhat kind of first impression\nyou have on people?\nThanks to the Myers-Briggs\nPersonality Type Indicator,\nor MBTI, one of the most popular\nand widely used personality\ntests in the world,\nyou can have a better idea\nnot only about who you are\nbut also about who other\npeople perceive you to be.\nHere is why people might\nbe intimidated by you,\naccording to your personality type.\nNumber one, ISFJ, the Defender.\nKnown for being friendly,\ngenerous, supportive,\npatient, and reliable,\nsome people may feel intimidated\nby an ISFJ's uncommonly kind nature\nand wonder, why are they\nbeing so nice to me?\nWhat's in it for them?\nWell, the answer is nothing really.\nISFJs just love helping people\nfor the sake of helping them.\nISFJs are open, nurturing,\nand gentle people\nwith no ulterior motive in sight.\nNumber two, ESFJ, the Caregiver.\nAlso called the Consul,\nESFJs might be intimidating\nto other people\nbecause of how effortlessly likable\nand popular they tend to be.\nSocial butterflies who everyone\nwants to be friends with.\nThey're charming, friendly, and confident.\nThey make life look so easy and fun\nthat it's hard not to envy them,\nbut even harder not to love them\nbecause of how bubbly,\nloyal, and lovable they are.\nNumber three, ISTJ, the Logistician.\nIf ESFJs are the vibrant and\noutgoing life of the party,\nISTJs are the complete opposite.\nThey are reserved, dutiful,\nrational, and steadfast.\nIf you're an ISTJ,\npeople are most likely too\nintimidated to approach you\nbecause of how matter\nof fact you tend to be.\nYou might also seem a bit\nharsh and cold-hearted\nbecause of your tendency\nto value truth and logic\nmore than emotional needs of others.\nBut hey, there's nothing\nwrong with being a pragmatist.\nNumber four, ESTJ, the Executive,\none of the most intimidating\npersonality types out there.\nHigh-achieving perfectionists,\nESTJs aren't always the\nmost approachable of people\nbecause of how strictly\nthey uphold the rules,\nimpose order, and expect\neveryone else to do the same.\nThey believe in tradition,\norganization, and authority,\nwhich is why they have the tendency\nto come off as a bit bossy\nand controlling at times.\nNumber five, ISFP, the Adventurer.\nCreative and free-spirited,\nISFJs can be intimidating\nbecause of their constant\nneed to reinvent themselves.\nIt's hard to really get to know an ISFP\nbecause who they are\nis constantly changing.\nSpontaneous and adventurous,\nISFPs love to experiment,\nwhich can be intimidating for those of us\nwho like to play it safe and\nstay in our comfort zones.\nThey love to push the boundaries\nwhen it comes to social conventions\nbecause they value passionate,\nartistic self-expression.\nNumber six, ESFP, the Entertainer.\nOne of the most outgoing and lively people\nyou will ever meet, ESFPs just\nooze confidence and charisma.\nThey are irresistibly bold,\nvibrant, and original.\nESFPs also revel in\nbeing in the spotlight,\nand the spotlight loves them too.\nArmed with excellent people\nskills and a talkative demeanor,\nESFPs can seem a little\nintimidating to those of us\nwho aren't as confident\nin social interactions\nand prefer to listen more than we speak.\nNumber seven, ISTP, the Virtuoso.\nKnown for their fiercely independent\nand results-oriented attitude,\nISTPs aren't usually intimidating.\nIn fact, they're often very fun-loving,\nenergetic, and easygoing.\nBut in times of serious\nneed and dire situations,\nwhen everyone else has\nalready started panicking,\nyou can expect them to stay\ncalm and on top of everything.\nDecisive, determined,\nand always in control,\nISTPs love thinking on their feet\nand leaping before they look\nbecause they're fearless and\nthrill-seeking individuals.\nSo befriending an ISTP is definitely not\nfor the faint of heart.\nNumber eight, ESTP, the Entrepreneur.\nOne of the most perceptive\nof all the personality types,\nESTPs have an uncanny\nknack for reading people,\nwhich can be a bit unsettling\nfor those who prefer to stay closed off\nand guarded about their feelings.\nMysterious and observant,\nESTPs could easily become\nmaster manipulators\nif they wanted to.\nLuckily for us though,\nthey have no interest\nin playing mind games.\nThey prefer to be open,\nhonest, and direct.\nThere's never any beating\naround the bush with an ESTP.\nNumber nine, INFJ, the Advocate.\nINFJs work tirelessly to save the world\nand make it a better place for everyone.\nKind, compassionate, and altruistic,\nINFJs are peace-loving diplomats\nwith a lot of emotional depth.\nAnd this introspective,\nstill waters run deep kind of nature\ncan be intimidating for some,\nespecially because INFJs are\nvery hard to get to know.\nThey value their privacy a lot\nand tend to seem a bit\ndistant and guarded.\neven with their closest\nfriends and family.\nNumber 10, ENFJ, the Protagonist.\nNext, we have the ENFJ,\nwho most people tend to find intimidating\nfor the opposite reason as INFJs.\nENFJs are so authentic and genuine\nthat it kind of catches\na lot of us off guard.\nBig-hearted and empathetic,\nthey live to inspire others\nand love taking on the role of mentor,\nsupporting their loved ones\nand providing boundless encouragement.\nOn bad days, though,\nthey can come off as a bit\ncondescending and patronizing.\nNumber 11, INFP, the Mediator.\nAlthough they're often seen as thoughtful,\ninnocent, softhearted idealists,\nINFPs have a dark side too.\nThey can be incredibly rigid\nin their unrealistically high expectations\nof both themselves and their loved ones.\nSo if you ever go against their beliefs\nor fail to live up to their\nidealized version of you,\nthey will most likely begin to\ndistance themselves from you\nor hold a grudge against you\nfor not being the person\nthey thought you were.\nNumber 12, ENFP, the Campaigner.\nIf ESTJs intimidate people\nwith how rule-abiding\nand traditional they are,\nENFPs intimidate people\nwith how unconventional\nand non-traditional they like to be.\nFun, spontaneous, and highly creative,\nENFPs love to challenge the usual way\nof doing things and going\nagainst societal norms.\nThey permanently live outside of the box\nbecause they think life's\ntoo short to be boring.\nNumber 13, INTP, the Logician.\nAn objective and straightforward\ncritical thinker,\nsome people might find\nINTPs to be intimidating\nbecause of their blunt,\nalways questioning attitude.\nINTPs love to learn and they seek to know\nall that is knowable,\nhence they love researching, theorizing,\nand having intellectual discussions\nwith like-minded people.\nNumber 14, ENTP, the Debater.\nQuick-witted and sharp-tongued,\nno one loves a good\ndebate more than an ENTP.\nAnd for some people that\ncan be a bit off-putting\nto always have everything\nyou say and think challenged,\nbut ENTPs don't mean any harm by it.\nThey just love attacking and\ndefending ideas at every angle,\ntaking them apart only to\nput them back together again.\nNumber 15, INTJ, the Architect.\nRational, independent, and self-possessed,\nINTJs are often viewed as intimidating\nfor the very same reasons they're admired.\nThat is, they always have a\ngood idea of what they want,\nhow to achieve and stick\nto it, no matter what.\nBut this decisiveness, competence,\nand strong sense of efficacy\ncan easily be mistaken\nas arrogance too.\nAnd finally, 16, ENTJ, the Commander.\nLast but certainly not least,\nwe have the ENTJ, or the Commander.\nAs you might've already guessed,\nmost people find them intimidating\nbecause of their incredibly focused,\ndriven, and goal-oriented attitudes.\nBold, brazen, and confident,\nENTPs are natural-born leaders\nwho have no problem taking\ncharge and calling the shots.\nSo did you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here?\nWhat was your personality type\nand why do you think people\nmight be intimidated by you?\nDid you find this video
