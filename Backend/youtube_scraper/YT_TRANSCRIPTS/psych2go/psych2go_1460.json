depressed\nwhen we face certain\nlife-changing events in our lives.\nHowever, when these symptoms\nbecome persistent and overwhelming\nand start to affect your daily routine,\nit can start to deter you\nfrom leading a normal, healthy life.\nWhile you may think people with depression\nall cry and feel sad all the time,\nthat's not necessarily the case.\nDifferent people may\nexhibit different symptoms.\nSo, to look into the ways\ndepression can manifest itself\nin people's behaviors and moods,\nhere are 10 ways depression appears in us.\nBut before we begin,\nwe would like to mention that this video\nis created for educational purposes only\nand is not intended to substitute\na professional diagnosis.\nIf you suspect you may have depression\nor any mental health condition,\nwe highly advise you to seek help\nfrom a qualified mental\nhealth professional.\nOkay, let's begin.\nNumber one: Depressed\nmood nearly every day.\nHave you ever noticed a drastic change\nin your loved one's behavior and mood?\nPerhaps they used to be\nreally happy and cheerful,\nbut have become more\ntearful and gloomy nowadays.\nThe feeling of sadness,\nemptiness, and hopelessness\nis one of the diagnostic\ncriteria listed in the DSM-5.\nPeople who experience such a low mood\nnearly every day for two weeks or more\nwould be classified as\nhaving major depression.\nNumber two: Diminished\ninterest or pleasure\nin all or almost all activities.\nHave you ever had a friend\nwho started avoiding\nthe hobbies or activities you\nused to enjoy doing together?\nIf so, they may be experiencing anhedonia.\nThis is the experience of\na sudden loss of interest\nor pleasure in activities\nthat they previously enjoyed.\nAnhedonia is also one of the\ntelling signs of depression.\nNumber three: Significant\nweight loss or weight gain.\nHave you noticed that your friend\nhas lost a significant amount of weight\nsince the last time you saw them?\nThere could be a chance\nthat they might be\nexperiencing depression.\nDepression can affect a\nperson's eating pattern,\ncausing them to either lose\nor gain significant weight.\nYou might wonder how much weight change\nwould be considered concerning.\nWell, according to one of the criteria\nof major depressive\ndisorders in the DSM-5,\na weight change of more than\n5% in a month is significant.\nNumber four: Decrease\nor increase in appetite\nnearly every day.\nHave you started to\nnotice that your loved one\nhas lost their appetite?\nAccording to Dr. Gary Kennedy,\nthe director of geriatric psychiatry\nat the Montefiore Medical\nCenter in Bronx, New York,\npeople with depression lose\nboth energy and interest,\nand this includes a loss\nof interest in eating.\nThey may lose interest in cooking\nor lack the energy to prepare meals.\nAt the same time, nausea is\nalso a symptom of depression\nand may be a cause for\nloss of appetite as well.\nSimilarly, Debra Jay Johnston,\nwho works at an eating\ndisorder treatment center\nin Wickenburg, Ariz., stated\nthat depression can also result\nin emotional eating, a common\nevent in which the need to eat\nis not associated with physical hunger\nbut a response to emotional hunger.\nWhen patients eat in\nresponse to their emotions,\nthey are soothed by the food,\nas it changes the chemical\nbalance in the brain.\nIt produces a feeling of fullness\nthat is more comfortable\nthan an empty stomach\nand may help improve their mood\nthrough positive association\nwith happier times.\nNumber five: Insomnia or hypersomnia.\nDo they have trouble falling asleep?\nDespite being tired,\nthey may still find it difficult\nto fall and remain asleep.\nThis is a condition known as insomnia.\nOn the other hand, they\nmight also find themselves\nsleeping excessively throughout the day,\nwhich is a condition known as hypersomnia.\nBoth hypersomnia and\ninsomnia are sleep disorders\nthat are characterized by the disruption\nof normal sleep pattern,\nand it may be a symptom of depression.\nNumber six: Psychomotor\nagitation or retardation.\nSometimes, depression\ncan also manifest itself\nin the slowing or loss\nof spontaneous movement.\nPerhaps they've started to\nhave a lifeless complexion\nor have no emotional expression.\nThis is known as psychomotor retardation.\nOn the other hand, there\nis psychomotor agitation,\nwhich is the opposite\nside of the spectrum.\nThis can take many forms\nand usually involves\nrepetitive purposeless\nor unintentional movements and behaviors.\nNumber seven: Fatigue or loss in energy.\nAre they tired all the time?\nDepression can make a person feel\nconstantly fatigued and low in energy.\nThis tiredness and exhaustion\nmay cause them to cancel\nall of their plans with their friends\nand to stay in bed all day.\nNumber eight: Feelings of worthlessness,\nexcessive, or inappropriate guilt.\nHow do they feel about themselves?\nA person who is experiencing\ndepression might feel worthless\nor experience an excessive or\ninappropriate amount of guilt.\nThey might be overcritical\nand internally belittle themselves\nwhenever they fail to complete a task\nor reach their own expectations.\nThis in turn may further\nlower their self-esteem\nand worsen their symptoms of depression.\nNumber nine: Diminished ability\nto think and concentrate.\nDo they seem to have trouble focusing?\nAnother common symptom of depression\nis the diminished ability\nto think and concentrate.\nWith the many negative\nthoughts in their head,\nit may end up feeling like\na kind of internal noise\nthat disrupts and worsens their\nthinking and concentration.\nThis may end up affecting\ntheir ability to complete tasks\nor make it a struggle to\ndo assignments and work.\nAnd number 10: Recurrent thoughts of death\nor suicidal ideation.\nSometimes, depression\nthat goes unaddressed\nor worsens in time leads\nto thoughts of suicide.\nPeople who are severely\ndepressed might think about death\nand search for methods to end their lives.\nThey might say things like,\n\"It would be better if I weren't here,\"\nor be involved in risky\nand dangerous behavior,\nsuch as driving through red lights.\nIf you or someone you know shows\nany of these warning signs,\nplease call your local suicide hotline,\ncontact a mental health\nprofessional right away,\nor go to the emergency room.\nHave you noticed these signs in yourself\nor someone you know?\nRemember to reach out for help if you can\nand that you're not alone.\nIf you found this
