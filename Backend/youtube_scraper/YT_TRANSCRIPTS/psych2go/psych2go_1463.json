    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Do you often\nfeel like you can't relate\nto the way people your age think?\nAlthough it might make you\nfeel lonely and misunderstood,\nit can actually mean that\nyou're wise beyond your years.\nA lot of times maturity is\nstrongly tied to your age\nsince one's maturity is\nheavily reliant on experiences\nand knowledge.\nHowever, there are also\nmany life circumstances\nthat may force you to grow up\nin ways that others haven't.\nBeing more mature than\nothers of the same age as you\nmay mean that you're able to adapt\nand deal with different\nsituations and environments\nin a more effective and efficient way.\nSo do you think you're more mature?\nHere are six signs you\nare wise beyond your age.\nNumber one, you value time.\nAre you someone who finds it\nimportant to always be on time?\nIf you take your time very seriously\nand manage it efficiently and effectively,\nthen you're likely more\nmature than those your age.\nAs you start to have more and\nmore tasks in your schedule,\nyou may have learned the value of time\nand the importance of not wasting it.\nFor example, you may\nstart to assign less time\nto things that don't help\nyou move towards your goals\nor contribute to yourself improvement\nand more on hobbies and\nactivities that help you relax\nand recover from your daily schedule.\nNumber two, it takes a lot\nto surprise you these days.\nHow often do people's actions\nor behaviors surprise you?\nNot being easily surprised can be a sign\nthat you're wise beyond your years.\nThis does not mean that people\nwho are easily surprised\nare immature.\nRather this focuses on the\nfact that you're less surprised\nabout things because you've\nalready experienced them before.\nYou may be accustomed\nto some of the things\nthat people your age\nhave never experienced.\nSo rather than being surprised,\nyou start to think of ways\nto address the situation instead.\nYou use your past experiences\nto help you navigate\nyour current issues.\nNumber three, you're\nnot worried about looks\nand appearances.\nHow much priority do you\nput on people's appearances\nwhen meeting them?\nOne of the signs that you are more mature\nthan others your age is that\nyou stop worrying about looks\nand appearances.\nWhile most people tend to\nseek outside validation\nfor their worth and\nvalue, you know yourself\nand what you can bring to the table.\nThis type of thinking\nallows you to look beyond\nthe surface level and to\nappreciate others and yourself\nin a deeper manner.\nNumber four, you focus\non self-improvement.\nDo you ever take off time\nto focus on the things\nthat you need to do to improve yourself?\nIf you do this often\nthen it's a clear sign\nthat you're more mature than others.\nThis constant need to look\nfor ways to grow and improve\ncan lead to a more\ncolorful and better life.\nThis is because the progress you make\nand the different skills you developed\ncan help open more paths\nand options to you.\nThis can set you apart from other people\nwho may have a more passive attitude\ntowards their self-improvement.\nNumber five, you impress older\npeople with your insight.\nDo you often receive\ncompliments from older people\nfor the way you think\nand deal with things?\nOne of the easiest ways to tell\nthat you are wise beyond your years\nis by getting complimented by older people\nfor the way you adapt\nand deal with situations.\nPeople your age might not understand you,\nbut you'll realize how mature you are\nwhen people many years\nolder than you compliment\nyour perspective and thoughts.\nAnd number six, you question\nanything and everything.\nAre you a curious person?\nIf you're someone who is\nconstantly questioning everything,\nchances are you're more\nmature than people your age.\nThis habit to question things\nallows you to take things\ninto consideration before accepting\nor going through with them.\nNot questioning information you get\ncan lead to misinformation\nbecause of the possibility\nof interest getting in the way of truth,\nespecially with the way that the news\nand media operates nowadays.\nAdditionally, it can help\nmotivate you to build\non your knowledge and\nunderstanding of things.\nSo did you relate to any of\nthese signs we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\npsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks so much for\nwatching and we'll see you\nin the next video."
