make\npsychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that.\nSo, thanks again.\nNow, back to the video.\nIsaac Newton,\nSrinivasa Ramanujan,\nJudit Polgar, Stephen Hawking.\nAll these names have one thing in common,\nand that is intelligence.\nThese individuals have\ncontributed life-altering\nand influential works\nthat have changed the course\nof humanity in some way.\nThey are the highest ideals\nof human intelligence\nwhich some strive to become.\nHowever, just because you haven't proved\nFermat's Last Theorem\nor made an outstanding contribution\nto the sciences or arts,\ndoes not mean you don't\npossess intelligence.\nWhether it's doodling all the time\nor staying curious about the world,\ncertain habits or tendencies that you do\ncan turn out to be a sign\nof high intelligence.\nSo, without further\nado, Psych2Go presents:\n\"Eight Things Highly\nIntelligent People Do.\"\nNumber one, you can adapt.\nAre you able to adjust to\ndifferent environments with ease?\nIntelligence is not only defined\nby the ability to gather\na lot of information\nor by repeated memorization\nor regurgitation,\nbut also your ability\nto successfully adapt\nto changes in the environment.\nThis is because it requires\nmany cognitive processes,\nsuch as perception, learning,\nmemory, and problem solving.\nTherefore, being able to quickly\nand efficiently use\nthe information at hand\nto your advantage\nis a sign of high intelligence.\nNumber two, question everything.\nDo you take on every opportunity you get\nto learn more about the world?\nHighly intelligent and curious individuals\nsee every moment as an\nopportunity to learn.\nAccording to a Harvard Review article,\nCQ or curiosity quotient,\nalong with EQ and IQ,\ndetermines your ability\nto manage complexity\nand information overload.\nIt explains why many hiring managers\nwant candidates who seem\ncurious and conscientious\nsince those who are innately curious\nare more motivated to seek\nanswers and learn more.\nThis also means that they\naccumulate more knowledge\nthroughout their life\nthan those who only rely\non their intelligence.\nNumber three, you understand\nthat you don't know everything.\nAre you able to identify your\nstrengths and your weaknesses?\nIntelligent people are often perceived\nas being overconfident,\nbut truly intelligent individuals\nknow that they don't know everything.\nAdmitting that you don't know everything\nshows high levels of self-awareness,\nas well as metacognition.\nHighly intelligent people\nare able to access their\nstrengths and weaknesses\nand feel encouraged to learn more.\nNumber four, you seek knowledge.\nAre you always searching for information?\nThe correlation between\nlearning and intelligence\nis explained by neuroplasticity:\nthe brain's ability to restructure itself.\nWhen you learn something new,\nyour brain is creating\nelectrochemical pathways\nto access that information.\nHowever, the key is repetition.\nRepeating information can\nstrengthen the pathways\nyour neurons have created.\nThe more pathways you create,\nthe more fluid your\nintelligence will become.\nNumber five, you get bored.\nDo you get bored a lot?\nBoredom arises because you're excited\nabout being in a new environment,\nbut you're faced with setbacks\nthat prevent you from engaging with it.\nWhile being bored is frustrating,\nit's actually necessary for\ncreativity and intelligence.\nA 2019 study published\nin the Academy of Management Discoveries\nfound that participants\nwho are asked to perform\na mundane sorting task\nperformed higher in the later\ncreative section of the study\nthan those who are asked\nto create a complex story\nas to why they relate to an event.\nNumber six, you doodle.\nHas this happened to you before?\nYou're in a meeting or a lecture\nthat has gone on for hours\nand despite the boredom you feel,\nyou've started to take notes,\nbut halfway through, your\npage is covered in doodles.\nDoodling is your brain's way\nof trying to stay focused\nand also processing.\nScientists have looked\nat the brains of doodlers\nand found activity in\nthe prefrontal cortex,\nwhich is involved with\nanalytical thinking,\nmemory, problem-solving, and logic.\nA study conducted by Jackie Andrade\nat the University of Plymouth in the UK\nmonitored participants'\nlevels of engagement\nand memory during a mock telephone call\nand found that those who doodled\nretained 29% more information\nthan those who did not.\nNumber seven, self\nexamination and reflection.\nDo you tend to reflect on\nyour decisions and actions?\nWhen we think about intelligence,\nwe often think about\nknowledge-based intellect.\nHowever, there are many\nsides to intelligence.\nOne aspect of it is\nemotional intelligence or EQ.\nThose with high levels of\nIQ are generally self-aware\nand introspective.\nThey have a clear sense of who they are\nsuch as their emotions,\nneeds, and desires.\nTherefore, they're more likely\nto establish meaningful relationships\nand to achieve their goals.\nAnd number eight, remaining open.\nAre you open to different opportunities?\nDo you enjoy learning about new things?\nVarious studies have investigated\nthe correlation between\nopenness and intelligence,\nand found that the degree of openness\ncan actually affect\nyour fluid intelligence.\nSo, being open-minded\nsignals cognitive\nadaptability and flexibility,\nwhich is what keeps you\ncurious and ready to learn.\nRemember that intelligence\ncannot be easily measured\nand it's not fixed.\nSo, keep learning and surprising yourself.\nLet us know if you've done\nany of the things we've listed\nin the comments below.\nIf you find this video
