    "transcript": "ever wonder why the punchline to every\npsychology joke always has something to\ndo with either our childhoods or our\nissues with our parents or why people\nlying on a therapist couch tend to\nanswer the question so tell me about\nyour problem with it all began when I\nwas little it's because on some level we\nall intuitively understand that our\nchildhood experiences play a big role in\nshaping who we are and what we believe\nabout others ourselves and the world\naround us that's why so much of\npsychology research theories and\nPsychotherapy focuses on understanding\nthe impact Early Childhood experiences\nhave on a person one particular line of\nresearch in the field focuses on adverse\nchild experiences and the therapy built\non these studies known as psychodynamic\napproaches aims to ameliorate the\ndetrimental impact it can have on us\neven while into adulthood the US\nChildren's Bureau defines adverse\nchildhood experiences or Aces as\ntraumatic events that occur during\nchildhood such as abuse neglect illness\ninjury bullying or pure victimization\nthe long-term effects of such\nexperiences can manifest either\nphysically psychologically or\nbehaviorally surveys show that children\nwho were victims of emotional abuse\noften grow up to have overall poor\nhealth receive lower education are more\nlikely to suffer from poverty weight\ngain obesity and significant\npsychological stress but what about\ntheir story Beyond these numbers what\nare other important but often over\nlooked ways the abuse still lingers and\nhurts them in the present let's dive\neven deeper into how a childhood\nemotional abuse affects you even in\nadulthood number one it makes you\nanxiously attached ever heard about\nattachment Theory pioneered by John\nbulby and Mary answorth attachment\nTheory posits that there are generally\ntwo kinds of attachment Styles we\ndevelop as a result of our early\nexperiences with our parents or\ncaregivers that is secure attachment and\ninsecure or anxious attachment\nanxious attachment is then categorized\nas either preoccupied when you have a\npositive view of others but a negative\nview of yourself leading to self-doubts\ninsecurity and cleanness dismissive when\nyou have a positive view of yourself but\na negative view of others which makes\nyou distant and overly self-reliant or\nfearful disorganized the attachment\nstyle of those who have experienced\nabuse people with a fearful disorganized\nattachment style tend to be very wary\nand guarded around others as well as\nbeing extremely sens to rejection\nconflict and abandonment and as adults\nthey often struggle to form lasting\npositive relationships as a result of\ntheir unresolved attachment related\ntrauma which brings us to our next Point\nnumber two it stunts your emotional\ndevelopment being emotionally abused as\na child stunts your emotional\ndevelopment because it teaches you all\nthe wrong things about life instead of\nlearning important skills like emotion\nregulation self-awareness and\nrelationship management victims of\nemotional abuse often grow up to develop\nissues such as emotional codependency\nself-blame and social isolation number\nthree it leads to self-destructive\npatterns when someone comes from a home\nthat fails to provide them with a sense\nof Safety and Security important to\nevery child's development more likely\nthan not that child will grow up to\ndevelop self-destructive patterns and\nmaladaptive coping mechanisms instead\naccording to a meta survey done by the\nmental health center of destination hope\nthese can manifest in a number of ways\nsuch as in their behaviors developing\naddictions delinquencies Suicidal\nTendencies or their thought patterns low\nself-esteem depression anxiety number\nfour it compromises your quality of life\ntaking all of the things we've talked\nabout into account it should come as no\nsurprise then that many researchers have\nfound that the experience of childhood\nemotional abuse is associated with\npoorer quality of life thankfully many\nStudies have also highlighted that a lot\nof victims of abuse can and do recover\nthriving later in life despite their\nadverse childhood experiences the\ntrouble is most of them unfortunately\nhave to struggle to get there number\nfive it puts you at higher risk of\nmental health problems last but\ncertainly not least childhood emotional\nabuse can continue to haunt us even\nyears afterwards by putting us at higher\nrisk of developing certain mental health\nissues such as depression and anxiety\nall forms of child abuse have also been\nfound to be strongly correlated with\nPTSD substance abuse and suicide if you\nare struggling with your experiences of\nchildhood emotional abuse know that help\nis available the best thing you can do\nfor yourself is to reach out to a mental\nhealthc care professional today and\nbegin healing from the pain of your past\nconsider this the first day of your\njourney towards mental Wellness Recovery\nand self-discovery what's one way you\nwill no longer let your childhood\nemotional abuse affect you"
