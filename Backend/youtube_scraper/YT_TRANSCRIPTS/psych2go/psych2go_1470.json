    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nSo you're curious, what kind of traits\nmost people find attractive.\nEveryone's different.\nSo they may define a strong sense of humor\nas an important quality.\nWhile someone else may say trustworthiness\nis a key quality they need in a partner.\nBut there are quite a few common traits\npeople find attractive in others\ndespite varying personalities.\nSo here are six traits\npeople find attractive.\nNumber one, vulnerability.\nHow vulnerable are you?\nFor a relationship to work,\npartners need to be\nvulnerable with each other\nand open up about themselves.\nFamily and marriage therapist, Hal Runkel,\ntold Business Insider that,\n\"We like people strong\nenough to reveal themselves,\nwithout needing us to validate them.\"\nSo if you're wondering whether or not\nto open up to your partner\nabout your true inner self,\nperhaps now's the time to start\nbeing more vulnerable with\nthem about what's on your mind.\nNumber two, trustworthiness.\nDo you trust your partner?\nTrust is vital to a healthy relationship.\nDr. Michael McNulty, a master trainer\nand certified Gottman\nrelationship therapist\nfrom the Chicago Relationship Center,\nexplained to Business Insider\nabout how important trust\nis in a relationship.\nHe explained, \"Research tells\nus people only tend to move\nfrom romantic flings into\nbonafide relationships\nwhen they feel they can\ntrust the potential partner.\"\nTrust in a relationship is\nnot only about transparency.\nIt's a sense of investment\nin the relationship.\nIt's a sense of commitment to one another.\nIt's a sense that both\npartners are true to themselves\nwhile having each other's backs.\nThey're honest about\nwhat they want and need,\nand committed to working\nthrough their differences\nin ways that are fair to both of them.\nGreat advice.\nSo would you say you're\na trustworthy partner?\nDo you trust your partner?\nNumber three, kindness.\nHow kind are you?\nA 2014 study from Yan Zhang of\nHuazhong University in China\npublished in November 2014 issue\nof Personality and Individual Differences,\nwanted to see just how much\nthe most positive personality traits\ninfluenced their facial attractiveness.\nThe study had three groups of\npeople rate the attractiveness\nof 60 photographs of strangers\npictured with neutral facial expressions.\nThe researchers changed\nthings up for the participants\nweeks later when they\nhad a group read out loud\npositive attributes about those pictured.\nAnother group read negative attributes.\nAnd then the control\ngroup had no attributes\npaired with the photos.\nThe participants now rated\nthe strangers' attractiveness again.\nWhile most people originally agreed\non who was the most\nattractive from the photos,\nwith the positive\nattributes, this changed.\nParticipants rated those\nwith kinder descriptions\nas more attractive.\nThose with negative attributes,\nsubjects reported being\nturned off by them.\nTheir faces simply weren't\nas attractive anymore.\nBig takeaway, be kind\nto others, and yourself.\nAre you struggling to get\nmotivated by your goals?\nDo you wanna build better habits?\nIf so, you'll love our\nsponsor for this video.\nFabulous.\nThe number one self-care app\nto help you build better\nhabits and achieve your goals.\nThis

Insider\nthat, \"We like people who\ncan laugh at themselves\nand yet still be comfortable\nin their own skin.\"\nA little humility never\nhurt anybody, right?\nRight.\nBut seriously, it's best to\nrelax around your partner\nand have a bit of humility.\nBe humble.\nNobody likes someone who\nis constantly overbearing.\nSo be comfortable in yourself.\nThat's great, kid.\nBut as Han Solo once\nsaid, \"Don't get cocky.\"\nNumber five, genuine interest in others.\nWouldn't you want your partner\nto have a genuine interest in you?\nOf course, you would.\nIt's time to actively\nlisten to your partner\nand be there for them,\nas long as it's genuine interest, that is.\nWe're pretty good at spotting\nwhen someone is coming\noff as disingenuous.\nSo if you find you're just not interested\nin hearing what your partner has to say,\nmaybe they're not the right fit for you.\nOr maybe you need to work\non your listening skills.\nSame goes for them.\nDo they never have time to listen to you?\nNot that attractive of a quality.\nBeing a great listener\nis one attractive quality\nthat is also important in\nany healthy relationship.\nSo next time you're on a date,\nit's time to turn those\nears on and listen up.\nYour date's talking about how\nmuch they love \"Star Wars.\"\nNah. Attractive.\nAnd number six, self-awareness.\nAre you self-aware?\nIt can be very attractive when someone\nis self-aware of who they are\nand how their actions\nand words affect others.\nThey can admit when they're wrong,\nand take responsibility for their actions.\nIf someone is not self-aware\nof their wrongdoings,\nor if they're immature,\nthey may become more defensive easily.\nThose who can self-reflect\non their actions in the past\nknow when they've done something wrong.\nAnd they'll learn from their mistakes\nthen maturely apologize.\nSelf-aware partners thrive\nin their relationships\nbecause they have an easier time\ncommunicating with their\npartner in disagreements,\nlearning from their mistakes\nand admitting when they're wrong.\nSo, are you self-aware, a great listener,\nhumble, trustworthy, vulnerable?\nWhat traits and qualities\ndo you find most attractive in someone?\nFeel free to let us know\nin the comment section down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share it with a friend, or\nsomeone you find attractive.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and\nhit the notification bell\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
