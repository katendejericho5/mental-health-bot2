    "transcript": "- Hey Psych2Goers, welcome back.\nThink you've never\nexperienced anxiety before?\nWell, you might not have realized it\nbecause people experience\nanxiety in different ways.\nYour idea of anxiety\nmight not align with\nhow you experience it.\nAnd you may not notice anxiety in someone\nwho grapples with it privately.\nSo, it's important to\nremember to always be kind\nbecause you can never know\nwhat others are struggling with\nwhen they're alone.\nIf you're dealing with anxiety,\nknow that you're not alone\nin facing these challenges.\nAnxiety is a normal part of life.\nIt alerts us to dangers\nand helps us prepare\nfor a wide variety of situations.\nBut according to the\nDiagnostic and Statistical\nManual of Mental Disorders, DSM,\nanxiety becomes a disorder\nwhen it starts to impact\ndaily functioning and\ndifferent aspects of life.\nWith that said, here are five things\npeople with anxiety secretly do alone.\nNumber one, overthink,\noverthink, and overthink.\nAnxiety disorders are\ncharacterized by excessive\nor disproportionate worry and fear\nthat gets in the way of daily activities.\nIt may not be as obvious to other people,\nbut those who struggle with\nanxiety tend to overthink\nwhile in the presence of\nothers and when alone.\nMany people who struggle with anxiety\ntend to dwell on negative thoughts\nabout themselves and their past.\nThey may replay these\npast events in their head\nover and over,\ntrying to think of what they\ncould have done differently.\nAnd may also imagine\npossible future events\nto try and anticipate\nthings that might go wrong.\nTwo, confine themselves\nto their comfort zone.\nEveryone feels anxious now and then,\nbut those struggling\nwith an anxiety disorder\nconstantly adjust their\nlives to cater to it.\nThey may stick to activities\nthat calm their racing thoughts,\nor engage in pursuits that\nallow them to avoid the things\nthat make them feel anxious\ninstead of choosing activities\npurely for fun or interest.\nLike re-watching the\nsame shows over and over\nbecause they don't have to\nfeel anxious anticipating\nwhat might happen next.\nSome people may not even\nbe able to leave the house\nout of fear of being in\nplaces and situations\nwhere escape may be difficult.\nOr they may struggle to leave the house\nwithout a certain person\nthey're scared to lose.\nThree, withdraw from social interaction.\nSome people with anxiety may\nhave a limited social life\nand turn down invites, not\nout of a lack of interest,\nbut to stay home to calm\ncertain worries and fears.\nIn some cases, the person\nmay seem uninterested\nin spending time with others\ndue to a crippling fear of\nfeeling humiliated, rejected,\nor looked down on in social interactions.\nPeople with anxiety may withdraw socially\nto cope with their fears\nand might avoid their phones\nor ignore or turn off their notifications\nto manage their feelings of anxiety,\nand then feel overwhelmed\nand anxious later\nwhen they see the backlog of messages.\nNumber four, procrastinate\nor struggle to finish tasks.\nPeople with anxiety, especially\nhigh functioning anxiety,\nmay seem like completely\nput together achievers,\nbut they may also grapple\nwith getting their work done\nwhen they're alone,\nbecause anxious thoughts may\nforce them to procrastinate.\nAnxiety also affects working memory,\nwhich makes it difficult\nto focus long enough\nto complete tasks.\nAnd so, they may then have to rush\nto get things done on\ntime, adding extra stress.\nThen number five, tossing\nand turning in bed.\nHaving anxiety doesn't\nimmediately translate to nervous,\njittery energy that\nothers can easily detect.\nSomeone with anxiety can\nseem calm and rested,\nwhen in reality, they might be\ntossing and turning at night,\nunable to fall asleep because\nof their anxious thoughts.\nIf they do manage to get some sleep,\nthey might be restless or\nriddled with nightmares\nabout their anxieties.\nFor example, those with\nseparation anxiety disorder\nmay have nightmares about being separated\nfrom their loved ones.\nAnxiety disorders are complex and varied,\nbut remember that a certain\nlevel of anxiety is normal\nand anxiety disorders are those that cause\nsignificant distress or impairment\nin different areas of life.\nIf you or anyone you know,\nare struggling with an anxiety disorder,\nplease don't hesitate to\nreach out to a qualified\nmental health care provider.\nCan you relate to any of these signs?\nShare with us in the comments\nand remember to like and share this video\nwith someone who might benefit too.\nAs always the references and studies used\nare listed in the description below.\nUntil next time, take care friends."
