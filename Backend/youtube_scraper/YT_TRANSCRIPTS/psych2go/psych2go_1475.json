    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to a brand new video.\nDo you struggle with depression?\nDoes it feel like no matter what you say,\nthey'll just brush it off as\na rough week or a down period?\nDepression can be a complicated subject\nthat many people avoid talking about.\nHowever, it's important to learn about it,\nas it may help you become\nmore aware of its symptoms\nand how it affects you in your daily life.\nSimilarly, it also helps you understand\nand help support others\nwho may be suffering from depression.\nSo, whether you're coping\nwith depression yourself,\nor wanting to learn more about\nits symptoms to help others.\nHere are five things depressed people know\nall too well about.\nNumber one.\nWorrying about all social interactions.\nHave you ever worried about\nwhat to say in a job interview,\nor how to respond to an ex?\nPeople with depression tend to worry\nabout all social interactions,\nnot just particularly stressful ones.\nWhile not everyone with depression\nstruggles with social anxiety,\ndepression is generally linked\nwith having trouble in\nsocial environments.\nThey may struggle to interact with others\nor question whether people\ntruly like being around them,\nno matter how many\ntimes they're reassured,\nthis fear of rejection may still linger.\nNumber two.\nConstantly feeling exhausted and drained.\nHave you ever pulled a late\nnight and woke up feeling awful?\nImagine that, but every day.\nDepression is generally\nlinked to other struggles,\nsuch as insomnia and anxiety,\nboth of which makes sleeping even harder.\nHowever, sometimes someone with depression\nmay still wake up without any energy,\nno matter how many\nhours of sleep they get.\nThis lack of energy can make\nit hard to get out of bed\nand do daily tasks that\nseem automatic to others.\nThink of depression as an invisible weight\nthat brings someone\ndown everywhere they go.\nYou may not be able to see the weight,\nbut it's always there,\nand it's making life harder for them.\nNumber three.\nFeeling as if life has no meaning.\nHave you ever tried to\npay attention to a class\nyou didn't enjoy at all?\nTime seems to go slower,\nand all you can do is count\nthe minutes until it's over.\nThis time-slowing, apathetic attitude\nis somewhat similar to how\nsome people with depression\nperceive daily living.\nThey may feel as if there is\nno joy or pleasure in life\nand that everything has\nbecome uninteresting.\nAfter a while, they\nmay even feel hopeless.\nLeading to the belief\nthat life has no meaning.\nIn turn, they may become\nunresponsive and unfocused\non the world around them,\nas well as lose interest in\nhobbies and other activities\nthey previously enjoyed.\nNumber four.\nLow self-esteem.\nDo you tend to compare yourself\nto all of the models and\ninfluencers on social media?\nPeople with depression do that as well,\nbut on a larger scale,\nwhere they may think that\nthey're a failure as a person,\nfamily member, friend, or anything else.\nThey may see everyone\naround them living happily\nand think it's their\nfault they're struggling.\nOf course, that isn't the case,\nsince depression is no one's fault.\nBut just as how it's difficult\nto stop comparing yourself\nto those on social media,\ntrying to stop yourself from\nthinking you're a failure\ncan be extremely difficult.\nAnd number five.\nComplicated relationship with food.\nHave you ever eaten because you felt sad,\nbored, or lonely?\nMuch like eating to pass time,\npeople suffering from\ndepression may use food\nas a coping mechanism.\nThey could over-eat to distract themselves\nfrom how they feel or\nto avoid feeling numb.\nOn the other hand,\nsome may also under-eat\nto cope with depression.\nThey may feel too numb or\nuninterested in anything\nthat even eating becomes\nexhausting and unappetizing.\nSo, was this video helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nBe sure to like, subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it,\nand don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThank you so much for watching,\nand we'll see you in the next video."
