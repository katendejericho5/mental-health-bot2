Glasofer,\na professor of clinical\nmedical psychology,\ndefines this fidgeting as edginess\nthat can also manifest\nas irritability, shaking or trembling,\nwhich can be more visible to outsiders\nthan the anxious person themselves.\nNumber five, sleeping\ntoo much or too little.\nSometimes sleeping too little or too much\ncan be a sign of anxiety,\nas people can use sleeping\nas a way to avoid anxiety.\nWhile sleeping is a way\nto take a pause or rest from anxiety,\nnot getting enough sleep at night\ndue to anxiety can mean\nthat the anxiety is too overwhelming\nto let you rest.\nAccording to the Sleep Foundation,\nan online source for sleep information,\nthere is a connection\nbetween sleep cycle and anxiety.\nResearch has shown that anxiety\ncan affect rapid eye movement sleep,\nprovoking disturbing dreams\nand creating sleep disruption.\nThe nightmares caused by anxiety\ncan reinforce negative associations\nand fear about going to sleep.\nThere can be a vicious cycle\nbetween anxiety and sleep deprivation\nas worrying can cause disrupted sleep,\nwhich then causes more anxiety.\nNumber six, being on\nsocial media too much.\nBeing on social media for hours\nor days on end\ncan be a sign of anxiety as well.\nLike some of the other habits listed,\nsocial media gives us a way\nto escape from our stressors\nand anxiety triggers\nby engaging our minds in something else.\nFor example, looking at pictures of cats\non social media can distract you\nfrom your anxiety\nand it can be a coping mechanism\nto deal with overwhelming anxiety.\nNumber seven, talking too much\nor too little, or arguing.\nThe truth is that some people\nthat may talk a lot\nare overwhelmed within a social situation\nor they can't tolerate the silence,\nso they start talking\nin order to relieve that anxiety.\nBeing quiet can indicate anxiety\nbecause they don't know what to say.\nStarting arguments can also\nbe a sign of anxiety\nbecause they can blame\nending the conversation\non that other person\nand be able to escape it.\nIn reality, the person is\nvery anxious and overwhelmed.\nBut instead of letting people know that,\nthe argument instigator would rather\npeople believe they're jerks.\nAnd number eight, forgetfulness\nand lack of concentration.\nMemory and concentration\nare impacted by high levels of anxiety.\nIf somebody keeps forgetting\nor keeps asking for things\nto be repeated\nbecause they're not concentrating\nor missing details of what you said,\nand your thinking to yourself\nthat they don't care about what you say\nor that they're not listening\nto what you're saying,\nthis could be anxiety.\nIt could be that this person\nis so in their head about\nwhat's bothering them,\nthat they're not present.\nAnd so, they seem inattentive.\nLike they don't care about the people\nwho are talking to them.\nDo you recognize any of these habits?\nDo you recognize these\nhabits in anyone you know?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nRemember to share this article\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAs always, the references and studies\nused in this video\nare listed in the description below.\nStay tuned for part two of this video.\nAnd until next time, take care."
