    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHow much do you know about sex?\nWhether you know a lot, or not much,\nthere are quite a lot\nof interesting things\nsex can do to our minds and\nbodies that you might not know.\nWhat are these things you may ask?\nWell, here are six things sex\ndoes to your mind and body.\nNumber one, sex may help\nincrease your cognitive capacity.\nAccording to a study\npublished in the Personality\nand Social Psychology Bulletin,\nsimply thinking about a sexual encounter\nmay enhance analytical thinking.\nThe study states that it suggests that\nwhen in love, people typically focus\non a long-term perspective,\nwhich should enhance holistic thinking,\nand thereby create thought.\nWhereas when experiencing\nsexual encounters,\nthey focus on the present,\nand on concrete details,\nenhancing analytic thinking.\nBecause people automatically activate\nthese processing styles when in love,\nor when they experience sex,\nsubtle or even unconscious\nreminders of love\nversus sex should suffice\nto change processing modes.\nAnother 2010 study published\nin the PLOS One, using rats,\nfound that sexually active rodents\nhad more neurons in\nthe part of their brain\ncalled the hippocampus when\ncompared to virgin rats.\nThis part of the brain\nhas an important role\nin memory and learning.\nResearchers noticed that\nwhen sexual activity\nlater stopped among rodents,\nthey lost those\nadvancements in brainpower.\nNumber two, sex may boost self-esteem.\nEveryone's different,\nbut according to psychologists,\nsex may aid in boosting your self-esteem.\nPsychologist Ryan Anderson\nexplained in Psychology Today\nthat lack of sex can lead\nto feelings of angst,\nself-doubt, and inadequacy.\nAnd there is strong evidence\nthat feelings of self-worth,\nand identity are strongly\nassociated with sex.\nHe goes on, explaining\nthat social pressure\nmay come into play with this.\nHe also notes that often sex therapists,\nand marriage counselors agree that couples\nthat engage in regular sex with each other\nhave far greater self-esteem\nthan those who don't.\nEveryone's scenario is different.\nFor some, sex isn't a priority,\nand might not affect their\nself esteem as much as others,\nbut for others, sex can't\nhelp but make you feel good,\nboth in mind and body\nin more ways than one.\nNumber three, frequent\nsex may help heart health.\nAccording to a study published\nin the Journal of Epidemiology\nand Community Health,\nfrequent sex may decrease a male's risk\nfor a fatal heart attack.\nResults from the research study revealed\nthat males who had sex\ntwo times or more a week\nhad a lesser chance of\na fatal heart attack\nthan those who had sex not quite as much.\nThe study noted additional\nfindings on strokes,\nand their connections to frequent sex,\nstating middle-aged\nmen should be heartened\nto know that frequent sexual intercourse\nis not likely to result\nin a substantial increase\nin the risk of strokes.\nAnd that some protection\nfrom fatal coronary events\nmay be an added bonus.\nNumber four, it can alter\nyour pain perception.\nSex can alter your pain perception?\nYup, and it's all thanks\nto a part of our brain\ncalled the hypothalamus.\nAccording to some research,\nsex may alter your pain perception,\nmaking you feel less pain.\nThis section of the brain\ncalled the hypothalamus\nreleases the feel-good hormone oxytocin,\nalso known as the love hormone.\nDuring orgasm or arousal,\nresearchers at Rutgers University\nfound that this release of oxytocin\nmay help women feel less pain.\nThis can be especially\ntrue during menstruation.\nAnother study published\nin the Bulletin of Experimental\nBiology and Medicine\nfound that extremely low doses of oxytocin\nreduced pain sensitivity in men,\nlowering one's pain threshold by 56.5%.\nNumber five, sex can take\nwork for longterm partners.\nThere's a popular belief\namong many young people\nthat sexual satisfaction\ncan diminish with time\nin long-term relationships.\nBut it actually just takes a bit of work.\nRecent research from the\nUniversity of Toronto\nrecognized that effort is required\nif you want to have a great sex life\nwith your long-term partner.\nSo don't expect it to\nbe wonderful every time\nif you don't put in some\nwork every now and then.\nA healthy relationship with communication\nand effort can equal a\nhealthy and happy sex life.\nAnd number six, sex\nbefore an important event\nmay lower your level of stress.\nLooks like sex may just help your grades\non your university final exams.\nA 2006 research study\npublished in the journal,\nBiological Psychology,\nhad subjects take part\nin stressful activities.\nThese included giving a public speech,\nor taking a difficult math quiz.\nSubjects who had sex before the test\nhad lower blood pressure,\nand lower levels of stress.\nThis was then compared\nto those who had no sex,\nthose who masturbated,\nand those who had sexual\ncontact without intercourse.\nThe study even claims that\npenile vaginal intercourse, PVI,\nbut not other sexual behavior\nis associated with better psychological\nand physiological function.\nYou may just have to\nthank, not only yourself,\nbut your partner as well, for\nthat A+ on your math exam.\nSo, which of these were you\nmost
