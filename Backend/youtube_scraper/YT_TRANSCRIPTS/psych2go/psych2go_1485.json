Simon Ph.D\nexplains that judgmental\nbehavior can include\nhaving a moral rating system\nthat is skewed in your own favor,\nand making a lot of negative\nmoral evaluations of others,\nas well as jumping to\nnegative moral conclusions\nabout others.\nPeople like this are often threatened\nby your admirable traits and qualities,\nand consistently try to put you down\nin order to make you doubt yourself.\nNumber five.\nGuilt-baiting.\nGuilt-baiting is frequently used\nwhen someone is trying to convince you\nto eliminate your\nboundaries, push your limits,\nand ignore your core values.\nAccording to professor\nand author, Preston Ni,\n\"Guilt-baiting can look\nlike unreasonable blaming\n\"and targeting the recipient's soft spot.\n\"Their goal is to hold you responsible\n\"for their happiness and unhappiness,\n\"or successes and failures.\n\"This gives them the ability\n\"to target your\nvulnerabilities and weaknesses,\n\"giving them more power to\npressure and persuade you\n\"into agreeing to their\ndemands and requests.\"\nAnd number six, victimhood.\nSimilar to guilt-baiting,\nvictimhood also gives a\nmanipulator the opportunity to,\nas Ni mentions, \"Exploit\nthe recipient's good will,\n\"guilty conscience, sense\nof duty and obligation,\n\"or protective and nurturing instincts.\"\nIn order to be effective with this move,\nthis person will deliberately\nput on an innocent,\nhelpless, or weak facade\nto truly make you believe\nthat they need you\nfor something that seems important.\nThis sign can be very\nhard to detect at first,\nbut can be a huge giveaway\nof someone's ill intentions\nonce you recognize it in them.\nSo, did you recognize any of these signs?\nIf you ever find yourself\nin a serious situation\nwhere your safety is at risk\nor you're being threatened or harassed,\nplease reach out for help.\nIn the description,\nthere are links to\nresources you can access.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find value in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are\nadded in the description below.\nThank you for watching and\nwe'll see you next time."
