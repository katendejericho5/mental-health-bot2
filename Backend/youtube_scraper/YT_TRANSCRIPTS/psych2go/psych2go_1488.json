    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers\nand welcome back to another video.\nThank you all so much\nfor the love and support\nthat you've given us;\nenabling us to make\nyet another exploration\ninto everyday psychology.\nSo let's begin.\nHow often have you\ndescribed someone as shy?\nSurely you can think of\nsomeone or maybe it's even you\nwho's shy and introverted.\nThis isn't necessarily a bad thing\nand you can often live a normal life.\nHowever, what happens if\nthe shyness is so intense\nand extreme that we shut\nourselves out from the world?\nWhat if we fear criticism and disapproval\nfrom others so much that\nwe limit what we can do?\nThis is often the case with\navoidant personality disorder\nalso known as AVPD.\nBefore we begin,\nplease remember that this is\nfor informative purposes only.\nIt's not intended to treat, diagnose,\nor prevent any condition.\nIf you resonate with any\nof the signs mentioned,\nplease do reach out\nto a qualified mental health professional.\nWith that said, here are six signs\nthat define avoidant personality disorder.\nNumber one, intense fear of rejection.\nDo you go to extreme\nlengths to avoid rejection?\nAre you extremely sensitive to criticism?\nFear of rejection is the\nbiggest telltale sign\nof avoidant personality disorder.\nWhile disliking and fearing\nrejection is relatively common,\nAVPD takes this to a new level.\nIt affects every aspect of your life,\nespecially relationships and work life.\nYou may also repeatedly\nperceive situations as negative\ndespite the contrary.\nAccording to \"Psychology Today,\"\nthis can be so severe to the\npoint that you prefer isolation\nover the possibility of getting rejected.\nNumber two, a lack of close relationships.\nSo you spot your coworker at the mall.\nUh-oh, what's your\nimmediate course of action?\nIs it more tempting to run\nand hide or greet them?\nUltimately, this huge\nfear of being rejected\ntranslates into difficulties\nin forming relationships.\nIf you go to great lengths\nto avoid surprise meetings,\neven with those you see on\na regular basis otherwise,\nthis might be a red flag.\nYou prefer to avoid others at all costs,\nunless you know that you'll be accepted.\nEven in relationships,\nyou may fear intimacy\nand push others away.\nAccording to a study,\nyou may find interacting\nwith others difficult\nand intimidating\nso you prefer to stay away from this,\nthus limiting your social network.\nNumber three, avoiding risk taking.\nHave you ever turned down\nopportunities for a promotion\nor job changes due to fear\nthat you might do something wrong?\nPeople with AVPD have a\ntendency to avoid risks\nor anything that might result in failure.\nFailure can be embarrassing,\nwhich is something that opens the door\nto rejection and ridicule.\nThis limits you in what\nyou're willing to do,\nwhich makes it hard to\ngain new experiences.\nThis can extend to work\nsituations as well.\nEarning any kind of\ndisapproval is a scary thought\nso you try to limit it\nas much as possible.\nNumber four, excessive shyness.\nIs meeting new people stressful\nand unappealing to you?\nDoes your need to avoid other\npeople at all costs often lead\nto social isolation?\nEven talking with others that\nyou do know can be difficult\nas it opens the door to\npotential disapproval.\nWhen with others,\nyou find that your thoughts\nare loud and overpowering,\noften negative and putting you down.\nYou might prefer to stay\ninside than go out with others,\neven if that's an activity\nyou think would be fun.\nThe fear of rejection takes\nover and impacts your decisions.\nNumber five, low self-esteem.\nAvoidant personality\ndisorder brings with it\nfeelings of inadequacy.\nYou might compare yourself\nto others and feel unworthy.\nYou can also feel socially inept\ndue to limited social interaction\nand your constant self-criticism.\nSelf-esteem problems make it\nharder to interact with others\nand can cause you to\nbecome even more isolated.\nAnd number six, avoids conflict.\nSince this disorder primarily revolves\naround fearing disapproval and rejection,\nyou may notice that you\navoid conflict at all costs.\nPeople pleasing is very\ncommon and can lead to issues.\nYou might settle for less\nand get involved in undesirable situations\nso that you can avoid disapproval.\nThis can also cause issues in other areas\nas you can find yourself\nunable to make decisions\nwhen other people are involved.\nPlease note that this disorder\nvaries from person to person.\nSomeone with a condition may\nfeel all, some, or different\nfrom what is listed here.\nThe disorder can be comorbid\nwith other conditions\nsuch as anxiety and depression,\nwhich can result from social isolation\nand fear of rejection.\nIt's important to know that\nthis condition can be treated.\nAnd with the right professional help,\nyou can immensely improve.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the ways\nyou can identify avoidant\npersonality disorder.\nWhat are your thoughts on AVPD?\nAre there any signs that we missed?\nIf you've been diagnosed with AVPD,\nwhat are some of your experiences?\nLet us know in the comments.\nIf you found this video interesting,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with\nsomeone who might relate.\nDon't
