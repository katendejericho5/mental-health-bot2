    "transcript": "hey psych-goers do you ever find\nyourself looking back on experiences\nwondering what you could have done\nbetter\noftentimes we can struggle with our\nfeelings of self-worth and confidence\nfor not doing well enough or for not\nbeing a certain type of person\nespecially in a day and age where\neverything we do can be scrutinized\nit can be difficult to feel like your\nbest every day\nif you've been feeling stuck or down\nthis is a reminder that you are a great\nperson and that you're valued here are\nfive signs you are a better person than\nyou think\nnumber one you're ready to learn from\nchallenges\nwhat is the mindset you adopt when\nfacing challenges\naccording to carol dweck a psychology\nprofessor at stanford university and\nauthor of the book mindset\npeople can be categorized into having a\nfixed mindset or a growth mindset\nsomeone with a fixed mindset has the\nbelief that qualities such as\nintelligence or abilities are things\nthat are set in stone on the other hand\nsomeone with a growth mindset believes\nthat these qualities can be improved\nthrough hard work and feedback from\nothers\nso what can this tell us about ourselves\nit can tell us that your success can be\ndetermined by your own self perceptions\nand beliefs\nby reframing the way you perceive\nchallenges you might find yourself\nembracing the process and overcoming\nobstacles with more resilience you might\nfind that you're stronger than you think\nand can achieve more than you might\nbelieve\nnumber two you confront your biases and\ntake responsibility for your mistakes\ndo you sometimes struggle with admitting\nthat you're wrong\nwe've all had our moments where we\nstruggle to accept that we made a\nmistake however acknowledging your\nmistakes and making amends can be a sign\nof maturity and respect\nmany people have the misconception that\nbeing a good person comes down to not\nmaking mistakes but in reality it comes\ndown to taking responsibility\naccording to psychologist dr dolly chu\nbeing a good person means confronting\nour wrongdoings rather than trying to be\nperfect\nso if you're someone who is not afraid\nof making mistakes and takes\nresponsibility for them that's a sign of\na great person\nnumber three you're compassionate and\nact with good intentions\nbeing compassionate and acting with good\nintentions are sure signs that you're a\nbetter person than you think\naccording to psychologist and author\nrick hansen one of the ways you can find\nout if you're a good person is by\nreflecting on your thoughts actions and\nwords\nif you constantly find yourself leaning\ntowards goodness such as supporting\npeople with positivity rather than\nfocusing on the negatives being more\nforgiving with someone who did something\nwrong or showing compassion for those\ngoing through hard times then that's a\nsure fire sign that you're a better\nperson than you think number four you\nmake time for others but also yourself\nwillingly making time for yourself and\nothers is a sign of great character\nconsidering other people's wants needs\nand opinions is a valuable thing and\nstudies have shown that helping others\ncan have a positive effect on people's\npsychological and physical health\nas a result the feelings of\naccomplishment and satisfaction you get\nfrom helping someone can be very\nrewarding\nat the same time it's important to make\ntime for your own wants and needs\nbelieve it or not treating yourself with\nthe same kindness that you show others\ncan make you a better person you might\nask yourself how does making time for\nmyself make me a better person if i'm\nnot helping others isn't that kind of\ncounterintuitive\nwell when you take time for yourself you\nend up feeling better and when you feel\ngood about yourself it can directly\nimpact how you interact and help others\ntoo you're also setting a great example\nfor self-care\nand last but not least number five\nyou fit your own description of a good\nperson\ndescribing a good person is very\nrelative and most people will have\ndifferent opinions on what it means\ntherefore not fitting the description of\na good person by someone else's\ndefinition doesn't necessarily make you\na bad person\naccording to dr paul de pompo a\npsychologist and author based in\ncalifornia\ncategorizing your actions into good or\nbad might lead you to feel worse about\nyourself\nespecially when you feel like you did\nsomething wrong\ninstead dr pompo suggests that you think\nof three to five characteristics that\nyou think a good person has then see if\nmore than half of these fit you\nthat way your measure of a good person\nwill be from your own interpretation of\nwhat good entails all in all being a\ngood person can be very personal and\nrelative to how you perceive it these\npoints serve as a reminder to those that\nmight be struggling to help you see that\nyou're a better person than you think\nand that you're stronger than you feel\nright now while this is not a definitive\nguide to being good or great person we\nhope that you enjoyed watching this\nvideo and learned something valuable if\nyou were able to relate to any of these\nsigns then chances are you're a great\nperson and you should feel confident and\nproud\nhow would you describe a good person do\nsome of these traits reflect your own\npersonality
