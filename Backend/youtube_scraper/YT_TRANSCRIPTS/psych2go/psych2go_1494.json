    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2goers.\nHave you ever entered a room\nfull of unfamiliar faces\nand frozen up, or felt\na sudden urge to leave?\nFor some people, confidence,\nwhich is when you feel self-assured,\nand know that you can\nface any uncertainty,\ndoesn't come easily.\nSo with that said,\nhere are six ways to appear\ninstantly more confident.\nNumber one, face your fears head-on.\nDo you stop yourself from\ntaking part in a new experience\nbecause you feel scared?\nFeeling afraid of something dangerous\nis your mind's way of\nprotecting you from harm.\nBut your brain can also delude you\ninto feeling fearful over\nharmless things, too,\nlike public speaking.\nAllowing fear to overcome you\nstops you from fully\nrealizing your dreams.\nConfidence doesn't grow from inaction,\nbut from being able to make\na move, despite the fear.\nNumber two, embrace failure.\nAre you hard on yourself\nwhen you make a mistake?\nFailure is the stepping stone to success.\nNo one ever becomes a master at something\nbefore becoming a beginner,\nand being new at something\nentails failing at something\nonce, twice, even a hundred times.\nBy accepting failure,\nyou'll learn what works and what doesn't,\ngiving you more confidence\nin the decisions you make.\nDon't allow failure to\nstop you from trying.\nNumber three, speak with clarity.\nDo you speak quietly or maybe too fast?\nThe way you speak is one\nway that can make or break\nhow you look in front of others.\nBy bumbling, muttering, or trailing off,\nlisteners may not buy into your words,\nwhich could lead to doubt\nabout what you're trying to convey.\nTake the time to say your\nwords slowly and clearly.\nPractice articulating your words,\nand maybe even listen to an\naudio recording of yourself\nto get a feel for how you speak.\nNumber four, mind your body language.\nAre you mindful of how\nyou present yourself\nin front of others?\nYour body language plays a big role\nin how you project confidence,\nfrom the way you stand,\nto the position of your hands.\nAre your arms crossed? You may\ncome across as disinterested.\nIs your foot facing away from the speaker?\nSome may think\nthat you wanna leave the\nconversation right away.\nInstead, you could perhaps\nfollow some positive,\napproachable, and self-assured behaviors\nsuch as maintaining\nappropriate eye contact\nand mirroring the other person's\nbody language naturally.\nNumber five, question your doubt.\nHave you ever thought\nyou weren't good enough?\nDoubt is one way of protecting yourself\nfrom the pain of failure, but\nit also leads to inaction.\nDoubt can come in the\nform of limiting beliefs\nlike I'm not good enough,\nor I keep messing up.\nNotice those feelings\nand question why they\ncame up when they arise.\nIt may be easy to look at the bad side,\nbut by focusing on positive outcomes,\nyou can trick your mind into believing\nthat doing that scary thing\nmay be achievable after all.\nAnd number six, take a deep breath.\nDuring a tense moment,\nyou may activate your\nfight-flight-or-freeze response.\nThis can cause you to\nunknowingly hold your breath\nor speed it up.\nWhen you realize your\nbreathing has changed,\ndo your best to calm\ndown, notice your breath.\nStart by inhaling deeply,\nthen move it to your stomach\nas your diaphragm expands.\nThen exhale out.\nIf you're alone, you can\ntry breathing exercises\nto boost your overall mood, too,\nwhich can help clear your thoughts\nand bring them back to the present moment.\nSo have you learned new ways\nto become more confident?\nDo you have any suggestions\nthat haven't been covered?\nFeel free to leave them\nin the comments below.\nPlease note the references\nand studies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nAlso remember to like,\nsubscribe, and share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nThanks so much for\nwatching. Until next time."
