    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nYou've planned a romantic date\nalong the banks of a French river.\nYou've ordered two dozen roses,\nclipped and plastered with\ntacky fake gold paint.\nYou've purchased an overpriced fragrance\nthat makes you smell like oregano\nand citrus fruit combined.\nHuh, weird combo.\nThe point is, your dream date is set,\nbut what if you wanna show your partner\nyou're interested through\nsimple body language\nor dare I say romantic gestures\nbesides just an extravagant\nbouquet of roses.\nWell, here are six seductive gestures\nthat most people find irresistible.\nNumber one, keeping it close.\nHow close you are to\nyour partner can affect\nhow fast your bond may grow.\nNot only should you work on\nbecoming emotionally close,\nbut physically close as well,\nspecifically a little\nless than a meter apart.\nWhen you're first dating someone\nthis is a good space to keep\nif you wanna show you're interested.\nMoving any closer means you're moving\ninto the zone reserved for lovers,\noften only intimate partners,\nclose friends and family feel comfortable\ncloser than a meter.\nNumber two, to look or not to look.\nSocial psychologist, Michael Argyle,\nwas one of the first of his profession\nto study how men and women\nlooked at each other.\nUsually, when someone\nis attracted to someone,\nthey may take a peek behind their shoulder\nor glance their way.\nOnce the other notices them,\nthey'll avert their eyes in hopes\nthey won't notice the stare.\nYou can try tell if your\ncrush likes you back\nby noticing from the corner of your eye,\nwhether or not they decide to look back\nor they may be trying to\navoid staring at you as well.\nOr they're just wondering\nwhy you're staring at them.\nNumber three, tilt your head.\nSeveral studies have shown\nthat when one tilts their head\nto one side when another is talking,\nthey're interested in\neither what they have to say\nor simply the person themselves.\nIf you've made an impression on someone,\nthey may just tilt their head,\nshowing openness towards you.\nOr if you'd like to\nappear more attractive,\nyou may just want to tilt your head.\nIn one study, female faces were rated\nas more feminine and attractive\nwhen angle downwards.\nMale faces was seen as more masculine\nwhen they tilt their head upwards.\nWhen it came to males,\nthere was no constant\nas male faces peaked on the attractive\nscale when angled slightly downward.\nSo go ahead and tilt your\nhead a bit to the side,\ngive your crush those big puppy dog eyes.\nIt may just make them\nmore attracted to you.\nNumber four, show affection\nwith the touch of a palm.\nAccording to Joe Navarro, M.A.,\na 25 year old veteran of the FBI,\nfull touch of the palm of the hand\nis the best way to go\nand showing affection.\nNavarro served on the National Security\nDivisions Behavioral Analysis Program\nand in his book, \"Louder than Words\",\nhe comments that how\nexactly we touch others\nis determined by our feelings for them.\nHe notes that full touch\nwith the palm of the hand\nis considered warm and affectionate\nwhile touching with the\nfingertips betrays less affection.\nSo if you're going to hold their hand,\nhold the hand, palms\ntogether, fingers intertwined.\nUnless they hold hands the other way,\nintertwine fingers on\nnot intertwine fingers.\nNumber five, expose your wrists.\nShocking, I know, the wrists.\nSome people think that your wrists\nare a sign that you like someone\nand are opening up to them.\nOur neck and wrists are\nsome of the most vulnerable\nparts on our body.\nSo if your partner lays\ntheir hands out on the table,\nwrist exposed, oh, snap.\nThey may be just opening up to you.\nSome even think that you\nare essentially available\nwhen you hold your right\nwrist in your left hand.\nBut when you hold your left\nwrist in your right hand,\nyou could be hostile.\nExpose your neck and wrists with caution.\nWho knows, maybe a preying Anole\njump out of the shadows and\nsnatch you, vulnerability.\nNumber six, resemble your date's gestures.\nIf you want your partner to like you,\nit's important to stay true to yourself,\nbut mimicking your partner's\ngestures may just show them\nyou're interested in them.\nWhen we unconsciously mirror\nanother's movements or gestures,\nthis is called the chameleon effect.\nMaybe you've heard of it.\nIt's been explored in several studies,\nand basically, people like\npeople like themselves.\nAnd when we like someone,\nwe may just start adopting\na few of their gestures unconsciously.\nSo if you can't tell if\nyour partners interested,\nsee if they're adopting\nsome of your gestures,\nand if you are mimicking their gestures,\nthey may not be able to resist themselves.\nSo which gestures will you try out?\nHave you ever found these\ngestures irresistible?\nOr maybe you didn't realize all along.\nShare with us in
