    "transcript": "- Welcome Dr. Mike to the\nPsych2Go YouTube channel.\n- Thank you so much for having me.\nHello to Monica, hello\nto all the Psych2Goers,\nI'm excited to chat mental health.\nThis is something I chat with,\nnot only with my patients,\nbut with my friends all the time,\n'cause it's a topic I\nget so passionate about.\n- Yeah, we absolutely love you.\nWe love how you make medical education\nso interesting and assessable.\n- As a family medicine provider,\nmost people think that we\nmanage only physical complaints,\nbut the reality is,\nnot only do we manage\na lot of mental health\nissues and wellbeing,\nbut we also see the mental health issues\nstart popping up as physical\nhealth complaints, initially.\nAnd then only upon further investigation,\nfiguring out that there's way more\nthat needs to be discussed\nbefore we started making a diagnosis.\n- Yeah, I think this really leads into\nthe question of relationship\nbetween mental and physical health issues.\nA common question that we\nget from the community is,\nwhat is that direct relationship\nbetween mental and physical health?\n- Yeah so, it happens\nin multiple pathways.\nFirst, our bodies are so interconnected\nthrough the neurological system.\nAny implication that plays a role\ninto how your brain is\nperceiving the outside world,\nis gonna change how your body\nreacts in the outside world.\nA simple way of seeing this is,\nif you're in a stressed out\nstate, high anxiety state,\nyour blood pressure starts to go up\nand that's a physical manifestation\nof something that's happening\non the mental side of your body.\nAnother way the body connects,\nis through a neuroendocrine pathway\nwhere the body actually starts signaling\nthrough different hormones,\nhow your physical body should react,\nagain, to your mental health state.\nAnd that plays out in a\nlot of different roles\nwhen it comes to chronic stress states,\nor chronic anxiety, or\nchronic depression states,\nbecause that's when you start seeing\nweight gain become an issue,\njoint pain become an\nissue, lack of motivation.\nAnd things that you might\nrelate to being more\nphysical health-bound,\nbut are actually related more\nto the mental health side of things.\n- Right.\nWhen you think of more common\nthings like diet and exercise,\nhow can that play a role in all these\nneuroendocrine pathways and\nthings that you just described?\n- So, because the body's so connected\nand is so reactive to each\ndifferent aspect of life,\nbecause the body's all about\nmaintaining homeostasis,\nwhich is sort of a balanced\nstate within the body.\nSo if you have a release\nof too much hormone,\nthe body will then counteract\nits initial release\nand decrease the amount\nof hormone being produced.\nAnd that sort of pathway,\nthat homeostasis pathway,\nhappens in many ways.\nWhether we're talking about\nblood pressure, pulse,\neven your environment,\nlike if it's too hot,\nyou start sweating.\nOr if you see a lion\nyou need to release a lot of adrenaline.\nThat sort of homeostasis\nis all about balance\nand it's best balanced,\nwhen you're experiencing\nboth ends of the spectrum.\nAnd when your mental health is in a state\nwhere you're only on\none end of the spectrum,\nthe negative end of the spectrum,\nwhere you're not feeling\nwell, or you're feeling down,\nthe body starts taking a toll on it\nbecause the blood\npressure starts to suffer.\nThe foods that you're eating\nstart to become foods\nthat spike your insulin,\ncausing you to crash more\noften throughout the day,\nhave less energy levels\nthroughout the day.\nAnd all of that is going to\nimpact your motivation levels.\nAnd once your motivation\nlevels start dropping,\nit's harder to go to the gym\nand it's harder to create\nsocial connections.\nAnd loneliness takes a huge toll on us,\nboth physically and mentally.\nSo, it's really like\nthis cascading pathway\nwhere it may start with not\nfeeling great and feeling down,\nthen it goes to, not eating healthy foods\nand eating a lot of junk foods\nthat make you crash and\nnot have motivation.\nThen to putting on weight,\nto having joint pains,\nto having less social connection.\nAnd that could further put\nyou back into that cycle\nof not feeling great, of\nhaving anxious thoughts,\ndepressive thoughts.\nAnd really that's what\na doctor should focus on\nwhen they're seeing you in the office\nor in a hospital setting.\nBecause when we look at patients\nand we look at the issues\nthat they bring forth to us,\nit's about understanding\nthem as a whole person.\nIt's very easy to just look\nat the end of that spectrum\nand say, \"Oh, well, you don't\nhave many social connections,\nlet's find you a social group to join.\"\nOr, \"You're not eating healthy foods,\nhere's a list of healthy foods.\"\nI am technically providing you a solution,\nbut it's not the solution\nto the actual problem,\n'cause the problem started\nmuch earlier in that pathway.\nAnd that's what a good doctor does,\nthat's what a good clinician does,\nis trying to figure out\nwhere that pathway starts,\nso we address that goal earlier on,\nso that pathway doesn't\neven get a chance to form.\nAnd to me, that's the beauty of medicine.\nThat's where like I get to play detective\nto figure out why it's happening.\nYes, we're talking about mental health\ncausing these physical manifestations,\nbut that's not always the case.\nSometimes it is a physical issue\nthat's causing the patient's symptoms.\nSo that sort of touch and go balance,\nunderstanding the person in front of you,\ngaining trust with them.\nThat's the beauty of medicine.\nThat's why I enjoy being\nin a room with a patient.\n- I think it's sort of similar to\nthat biocycle social approach to medicine,\nand really contrasting it\nto more disease models of medicine.\nAnd I think medicine as a whole\nis going more towards the\nbiocycle social approach,\nwhich is absolutely wonderful.\nWe have to treat people,\npatients, as a whole,\nrather than just isolated parts.\n- Yeah, and that's why\nearlier in my career,\nwhen I was a resident,\nI started seeing a lot of\nphysical complaints come in\nand being an osteopathic physician,\nI was doing some manipulation,\nI was getting them physical therapy,\nperhaps medications on\nboard where they needed to,\nor injections.\nAnd then I realized,\nI feel like I'm missing\npart of the spectrum here\nbecause I'm doing what the\ntextbooks told me to do,\nyou know, if a patient\ncomes in with disease X,\nthe treatment for disease X is Y.\nAnd I would prescribe Y\nand then the patients\nwould maybe get better\nor not get better at all.\nAnd then I would feel frustrated\nthat I'm not helping this person,\neven though I'm following what\nthe textbook told me to do.\nAnd that's when I began to realize\nthat the whole mantra of\nmedicine being an art,\nas much as it is a science, is so true.\nBut it's not because the\ntreatments are all that different\nand some people may have a\ndifferent choice of treatment,\nbut it's because of the\ndiagnosis being so subjective.\nBecause patients view the\nworld through their own lens.\nAnd then you have to view the\npatient through your own lens.\nAnd that's the art,\nbecause only through properly\nunderstanding the patient\nand what symptoms experiencing\nand why they're experiencing them,\ncan you make the right diagnosis\nthen come to the correct treatment.\nThe treatment is really the science,\nbut the diagnosis is where\nthe art form kicks in.\n- Right. Yeah,\nwith diagnoses sometimes being subjective,\nthere's often a lot of\nco-morbidities, right?\nSo I'm wondering how can, for example,\ndepression affect the body differently\ncompared to, I don't know, anxiety,\nor even different subtypes of depression?\n- That's an important point you raised\nbecause depression has different subtypes.\nA lot of times my patients\nwho do suffer with\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\nend up having symptoms of depression.\nAnd again, it's very easy to start saying,\n\"Oh, they're feeling down,\nthey lost motivation in\nthings they once enjoyed.\nThey're not sleeping well,\"\nand diagnose them with\nmajor depressive disorder.\nWhen the reality is,\nthey're actually suffering from\ngeneralized anxiety disorder\nfrom constant nervousness,\nconstant catastrophic thinking,\neven jitteriness from\nthis hyper arousal state.\nThat needs to be addressed.\nAnd then, the depressive\nsymptoms start to wane.\nSo it's really understanding,\nwhat is the source of the symptoms?\nBefore jumping to\nfollowing a checklist of,\n\"Oh, the patient has X, Y, Z\nand that's exactly the diagnosis.\"\nNo, what caused those things to happen?\nIs it from that true depressive state?\nOr is there something else going on?\nAnd why is that important?\nA, therapy tends to change\ndepending on which diagnosis\nyour patient falls into.\nB, medications change.\nThere are certain medications\nthat we use for both\ndepression and anxiety\nthat can be sort of an\nupper for a patient.\nSo if you have a patient who's\nstruggling to get out of bed,\nstruggling to be motivated,\nmaybe we use a medication\nthat will give them\na little boost of energy\nand make them feel\na little bit more motivated to do things.\nAnd on the other hand,\neven in a similar class of medications,\nthere's ones that make\nthem a little bit calmer,\na little bit more relaxed.\nAnd for patients who\nhave high anxiety states,\nmaybe that's the optimal play.\nAnd while we know that\nthese options exist,\nwe also know that they act\ndifferently on different patients\nbecause the psychiatric world of medicine,\nis not the most well\nunderstood part of medicine.\nBiggest class of medications\nwe probably use in mental\nhealth, are called SSRI's.\nAnd these medications, we have\ntheories as to why they work\nand none of them are\nquite fully proven yet.\nAnd the reality is that we see\nthe evidence that they work,\nwe see that they're well\ntolerated in patients\nwith certain side effects,\ndiffering on which medication you choose\nand you try and choose the best one\nfor your individual patient.\nBut the reality is, we don't\nfully understand them yet.\nAnd I think that's the world\nthat I'm really excited about,\nbecause I think there is a lot of future\nin pharmacology and understanding\nof how the body works.\nBecause that whole idea of homeostasis\nis what really makes it all tricky.\nYou give a patient one medication,\nare they getting better\n'cause you're increasing\nneurotransmitters?\nOr are you treating them because\ntheir neurotransmitters are going up\nand then their body, through homeostasis,\nis down-regulating the receptors\nthat those neurotransmitters bind to.\nSo by flooding the neurotransmitters,\nthat's not what's helping them,\nit's the body's reaction to that flooding\nand actually decrease sort of reactivity\nto those neurotransmitters.\nMaybe that's why their helping.\nAnd that's what I'm so\nexcited about to figure out\nfuture and how that applies\nto each individual patient.\nBecause no one patient\nis the same as the other.\nAnd that's why we start\nwith small dosages,\nwe work our way up,\nwe have a lot of education\nbefore we start medications.\nSo that's why, when I'm in my practice\nand I see a 15 minute\nappointment for a patient\nwho's worried about their\ndepressive or anxiety symptoms\nand they've never been seen before.\nThere's no way I can spend 15 minutes.\nI'm gonna be late.\nI'm gonna be 45 minutes with that patient\nto understand what they're going through,\nwhat their troubles are,\nwhat have they tried?\nWhat do they wanna try?\nLay out all the options,\ntalk about the dangers of the medications,\nlike not abruptly discontinuing\nand stopping medicines,\nbecause that can cause a lot of problems\nand really having an\nopen line of dialogue,\n'cause that's the only way to go\nwhen it comes to mental health.\n- Right and with starting\nso many, perhaps,\ndifferent treatment options,\nhow do you know which one's actually\ncausing the effect?\nHard to disentangle, I think.\n- I guess, the way that I do it, is first,\nI have a patient that's coming in\nwith depressive or anxiety symptoms,\nfiguring out severity and length of time\nof how long that they've\nbeen feeling these symptoms\nis the first thing that\nwe have to establish.\nThen figuring out what\nthe patient is open to\nor wants to do.\nBecause some patients may just\nwant to have that one visit,\nmake sure their blood pressure is okay,\nshare what is going on in\ntheir lives and that's it.\nSome patients want to be more aggressive\nand want to take medications.\nSome people rush to medications\nand maybe that's not\nthe best route for them\nbased on our conversation.\nSo I try and decide,\nis this gonna be a patient\nthat wants treatment A?\nAnd then do they want treatment\nin the form of cognitive\nbehavioral therapy?\nOr medications? Or both?\nOr maybe just learn about those options\nand then do some bibliotherapy\nwhere I give them some books to read\nor pamphlets to read on the subject.\nAnd then we have a followup appointment.\nAnd then from there, it's\nreally a feeling out process.\nUnless it's severe depression,\nmy general policy is to get patients to do\ncognitive behavioral therapy first.\nThe conditions that I mentioned,\nand then if that's not working\nor we feel like we could\nadd some extra benefit,\nthen we get medications on board.\nBut again, it's patient-dependent.\nIt's what they want, it's\nwhat they're comfortable with.\nBecause everything has side effects,\neverything has time commitments,\nprices, costs, insurances.\nOur healthcare system,\nespecially when it comes\nto the mental health side\nof things, is a disaster.\nThere's no other word for it.\nIt's an absolute disaster.\nI have to tell my patients,\nwith major depressive disorder,\nwhich means that they have\nlow motivation levels,\nto tell them that they\nhave to get motivated\nto call 20 different offices\nand see which one is\ngonna have availability,\nwhich one is gonna be able\nto take their insurance,\nwhich one has availability\nwithin the next six months.\nAnd it's like a recipe for disaster\nbecause that patient is already struggling\nto brush their teeth in the morning,\nor take a shower.\nHow can I expect for them\nto make all these calls?\nAnd that's where we\nhave the introduction of\ninterdisciplinary teams,\nwhere we have social workers,\ncounselors on staff that\ncould actually help patients\nwith things like this.\nGive them some assistance\nin finding availability,\nor perhaps, be an interim counselor\nwhile they are waiting\nfor their appointments\nthat are booked super far down the line.\nThat has been probably the biggest change\nthat I've noticed over the\nlast five, 10 years in medicine\nof working as interdisciplinary teams.\nWhether it's mental health related\nor even something like\ndieticians or nutritionists,\nbecause we need that.\nWe can't handle everything\nas primary care physicians.\nThis is physically impossible,\nespecially with the time\nconstraints we have.\n- Yeah, there's a lot\nof barriers, it seems.\nEven trying to access mental\nhealth in the first place.\nNot even when you're already\nin touch with the GP.\nAnd so I think it leaves\na lot of people wondering,\nwhether their feelings of stress\nmight just be the usual\nnormal feeling of stress,\nor whether it could be something more\nthat warrants a medical professional.\nSo what are your thoughts\non whether someone can tell\nif they should be reaching out to someone,\nor if it's short-term and\nmanageable on their own?\n- My first thought is, if\nyou're considering it, do it.\nBecause the worst case scenario in that,\nis that you go and you realize\nyou're glad you did it, but\nyou don't really need it.\nThat's literally the worst case scenario.\nAnd if that's the worst case scenario,\nyou might as well go and have\nthe relationship with your GP\nthat you're sharing what's\ngoing on in your life.\nBut for me, it starts with exactly that,\nhaving a GP, having a primary doctor,\nbecause if you have a primary doctor,\nyou're already seeing them regularly.\nAnd you're having what we\ncall touch points in medicine,\nwhere you're interacting\nwith your patient.\nIn those moments,\nyou can catch that the patient\nis feeling a little bit off.\nYou can catch that something's\ngoing on in their life,\nthat they may need some help,\nwhether it's counseling\nrelated, medication related,\nor even physical health related.\nSo to me, if you have\na primary care doctor\nand you're considering that, \"Should I go?\nI'm kind of feeling off,\" that's it,\nthat's the sign you're\ntelling yourself the trigger.\nGo and allow someone with\nan objective perspective\nto take a look and see if you can benefit\nfrom some kind of help.\nAnd sometimes patients come\nin and they speak with me\nand I feel like they're\ndoing a great job coping,\nwhere I say, \"Look, I think\nyou're doing a great job.\nWhy don't you take a look, read this book,\nI think it's gonna help you a lot.\nThere's some exercises\nand stuff to do in it.\nWe can reconnect in a\nperiod of two to four weeks,\nsee how you're doing,\nIf you're not benefiting greatly from this\nand you could use more, we\ncan escalate treatment.\"\nBut it's really about that experimentation\nand figuring out what works best\nbecause there's no\none-size-fits-all answer.\nThere's no score where you're like,\n\"If I feel like a five out of 10,\nthat means I need to go see a doctor.\"\nIt just doesn't exist, unfortunately,\nbecause mental health is\na very subjective space\nand it's a subjective space\nwith a lot of outside influence.\nYou could feel okay one day,\nbut then your partner\ncan be unfaithful to you\nthe next day and your whole\nmental state can change.\nAnd that's understandable.\nSo at what point does\nit become a disorder,\nversus a totally normal human reaction\nto someone breaking your trust\nor having a death in the\nfamily and you're grieving?\nThere's a lot of misunderstanding\nthat comes with that.\nI have young patients\nthat come to my office,\nbelieving that they\nthemselves are depressed\nbecause they read it online\nor they see their favorite\nsocial media star talk about it.\nAnd when I start talking to them,\nthey tell me that they had a\ndeath in the family recently.\nLike a week before, two weeks before.\nAnd I asked them like,\n\"If there was a person sitting next to you\nwho recently lost a family member\nand they were down about it,\nwould you tell them that they're depressed\nor there's something wrong with them?\"\nSay, \"No, absolutely not.\"\nI asked them like,\n\"Why are you feeling\nthat way about yourself?\"\nAnd they sort of start to realize that,\n\"Oh, this is normal. Part\nof life is being sad.\nPart of life is experiencing\nthe whole range of emotions.\"\nAnd it's really about that balance.\nWhen does that balance get thrown off?\nMedically, the definition of\nthe balance being thrown off,\nis that it starts impacting your work,\nit starts impacting your\nability to have relationships,\nfamily, social, romantic.\nAnd if those things are suffering,\nthat's when it starts getting\nlabeled quote, unquote,\ndiagnosis or disorder.\nAnd doctors technically\ncan put that as a code\n'cause we love our codes in\nmedicine and our nomenclature.\nWhen in reality, that means nothing,\nthe human in front of you is everything.\n- [Monica] Hey Psych2Goers,\nI hope you enjoyed this part\none interview with Dr. Mike.\nIf you want part two of this video,\ndon't forget to share this video\nto create awareness on how physical health\nmay impact one's mental health."
