    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers. Welcome back.\nDo you often notice when\nthe day has slipped by\nand you haven't\naccomplished a single thing?\nMm, don't worry,\nwe've all had those moments.\nThis is probably because you've\nspent your time doing things\nthat were not productive.\nThe first few minutes of your morning\nset the tone for the rest of the day.\nIf you spend your mornings\nnot being productive,\nyou're more likely to find it difficult\nto be productive the rest of the day.\nSo to have a productive day,\ntry to avoid the following:\nNumber one, not waking up with a plan.\nYou may fall into the group of people\nwho plan their day out.\nIn theory, this seems like a smart idea.\nYou can find yourself wasting a good part\nof your morning planning what to do.\nThe time you spend planning your day\nis time you could spend\nactually doing things.\nIf you also spend your morning planning,\ndo it the night before.\nHave a to-do list ready\nfor when you wake up,\nand place it somewhere\nthat will be easy to find.\nHaving a plan or a list\nof what you want to accomplish\nhelps you be more productive.\nNumber two, checking\nyour phone first thing.\nIt is tempting to check\nyour phone first thing\nin the morning.\nIt might even be a part\nof your morning routine.\nHowever, your phone may be the reason\nwhy you're not as productive\nas you want to be.\nThe problem with checking your phone\nis the tempting distraction\nof social media.\nYou see those little red\nnotifications on your app\nand you feel compelled\nto answer but try not to,\nbecause you can get\nsucked into the labyrinth\nof viral videos, TikTok dances,\nand random late night TV videos.\nMaybe you also check your phone\nas one of the first things\nyou do in the morning.\nNot because you have messages\nthat need your immediate attention,\nbut because you've become used\nto checking your phone out of habit.\nBut using your phone first\nthing can rob you of your focus.\nIt has been proven that smart phones\ncan break your concentration\nand even cause addiction.\nIt sounds absurd, but it's true.\nThe Journal of Experimental\nPsychology published a study\nin 2015 that found\nthat cell phone notifications\nsignificantly disrupted\nthe concentration and\nperformance of participants\nwhen they were performing\nan attention demanding task.\nThe solution, instead of\nscrolling through your phone,\nread a book or listen to a podcast.\nThe emails and messages\nare not going anywhere.\nNumber three, immediately\ntackling your chores.\nYour to-do list may be packed with chores,\nbut don't tackle them\nas soon as you wake up.\nThis piece of advice may\nseem counterintuitive,\nbut take the first moments of\nthe day to invest in yourself.\nMeditate, workout, or\nclear up your workspace.\nDevelop a morning routine\nthat mentally prepares you\nfor the day ahead.\nNot only does it get\nyou ready for your day,\nit also helps you cultivate discipline,\nwhich helps you remain productive\nfor the rest of the day.\nNumber four, snoozing.\nMm, yes, the old snooze button.\nIt is the master trickster\nthat makes you believe you have more time\nthan you actually do.\nSleeping in on its own is not harmful.\nThere are times when your\nbody will ask for more sleep,\nbut try not to make it a habit.\nIf you go back to sleep,\nyou might have trouble\nwaking up to show up\nfor what you have to do later on.\nStudies have shown that sleeping in\ncan have adverse effects,\nsuch as making you feel less energized\nand affecting the quality of your sleep.\nHowever, don't bolt\nright out of bed either.\nAllow yourself time to wake up.\nStretch or wiggle your toes.\nDo whatever you need to do\nto mentally and physically\nprepare yourself to wake up.\nOne way to avoid sleeping in\nis by placing your\nalarm far away from you,\nlike in your living room or the kitchen.\nOnce you're up and moving,\nit will be hard to go back to sleep.\nYou could also invest in a\ndawn simulator alarm clock\nthat wakes you up with UV light.\nNumber five, making too many decisions.\nAre you someone who spends an\nextraordinary amount of time\nand energy mulling over trivial decisions?\nMulling over matters like what to wear\nor what to eat for breakfast\nisn't very efficient.\nIt robs your brain of\nnecessary mental energy\nthat can be used later on.\nGive your mind space to breathe.\nMeditate to declutter your thoughts\nand try to simplify those choices.\nPlan ahead so that you\ndon't have to waste time\nin the morning.\nYou could decide on your\noutfits the day before\nor have a go-to look.\nIf making these decisions the night before\nis a hassle for you,\nmake them the day before.\nNot only will it save you time,\nbut it will also increase the chances\nof you eating something\nhealthy in the mornings\nif you're not in such a rush.\nSpeaking of eating, that\nbrings us to number six:\nnot eating a good breakfast.\nWe all have different\napproaches to breakfast.\nSome prefer it while others\nmay be due to dietary reasons,\nskip it altogether.\nRegardless of when you decide to eat,\nmake sure it's healthy.\nWhile sugary and fatty breakfast foods\nare usually quick and easy,\nit's best to steer clear from them.\nFoods that are high in sugar\ncause spikes in blood sugar levels,\nwhich can cause complications\nin the long run.\nOpt to eat proteins instead,\nwhich can improve muscle health\nand regulate glucose levels.\nThere are many healthy\nbreakfast recipes online.\nIf you have dietary reasons\nfor not consuming breakfast,\nconsult your nutritionist for guidance.\nMornings are important\nbecause they determine how\nthe rest of your day will go.\nWhat you decide to do in the morning\nshould leave you energized to\ntake on the rest of the day.\nAt first, having a routine\nwill help you improve your bad habits.\nBut don't be afraid\nto mix up your routine a little later on,\njust stay motivated.\nAs long as what you add\nbenefits your well-being.\nDo you relate to any of the\nhabits discussed in this video?\nIf so, let us know in the comments below\nwhat you're most likely\nto do in the morning.\nAlso, remember to like\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nThanks so much for watching.\nAnd we'll see you next time."
