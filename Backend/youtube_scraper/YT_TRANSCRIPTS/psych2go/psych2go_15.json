fantasies\ncan open you up to a world\nof self-discovery\nand awareness which can\nhelp you understand yourself\nand those around you much\nbetter Dr. Justin Lehmiller\nremarks Our fantasies\nappear to reflect who we are\nand seem to be designed\nto meet our unique psychological\nneeds So let's dive in\nand explore what our sexual\nfantasies can reveal about us\nIf you like it rough Do you like being\ndominated in the bedroom?\nHow about BDSM?\nBDSM is rooted in power exchange dynamics\nbetween a couple Usually,\none person plays the submissive role\nand the other plays the\ndominant role And it's a pretty\npopular type of fantasy One\nstudy shows that over 74%\nof respondents chose BDSM\nas their favorite fetish\nSo there's that A desire\nto always play the submissive\none in the bedroom indicates a\ndesire to lose control\nPossibly as an escape\nand a way of relieving stress\nor anxiety According\nto surveys in the book\nTell Me What You Want\nby social psychologist Dr.\nJustin Lehmiller those who prefer\nto be dominated in the bedroom\noften have anxiety around sex\nand would rather someone else\ntake the lead to take some\nof the pressure off them\nSubmission in the bedroom can be an\nindication of needing to\nfeel intensely desired\nor adored during sex\nwhich is often associated\nwith an anxious attachment\nstyle But for many,\nlosing control in the\nbedroom can be freeing\nand even work as a stress\nreliever while reducing anxiety\nSo, Fifty Shades freed anyone?\nOn the other hand, those who prefer\nto dominate may be craving\nor lacking power in other\nareas of their lives\nand may be trying to compensate\nfor it in the bedroom Either way, those\nwho enjoy dominating in the bedroom tend\nto possess stronger personalities Roleplay\nor Cosplay I think we've all daydreamed\nof being a character in\nour favorite movie TV show\nor even manga I mean,\nhow many people dress up\nas Sailor Moon or Naruto for Halloween?\nThe excitement of roleplay\nor cosplay can definitely\ntranslate to the bedroom\nand we don't blame you If\nyou're a fan of cosplay\nor roleplay in the bedroom\nthen this might indicate\nthat you're seeking a form of escape\nor distraction your regular\nday-to-day life According\nto clinical psychologist Dr.\nJoshua Klapao Roleplay is\nsimply an opportunity to escape\nour own reality By labeling\nit in a formal way we are\ngiving permission to act, speak,\nfeel and think in a way\nthat may be dramatically\ndifferent from our true selves\nThere are various reasons\nwhy a person might choose\nto escape their reality by\nengaging in roleplay such\nas needing a break from\nextreme stress or anxiety\nor even an escape boredom As\nlong as it doesn't interfere\nwith important aspects\nof life using roleplay\nas an escape mechanism can be healthy\nand a great way\nto spice things up in the bedroom\nJust remember that respect\nand consent are absolutely\nnecessary when engaging in any\ntype of sexual activity\nSo never feel obligated\nto do something you\naren't comfortable with\nSweetest Taboo Going back to\nDr. Lehmeler's study Those\nwho identify as extroverted\nare more inclined\nto fantasize about adventurous\nsexual encounters such\nas group sex and swinging It\nalso indicates a strong need\nfor attention When people\ndream of a threesome\nwith their partner and one\nother person it could be\nbecause they want all of the\nattention on them However,\nthe study found that those who identified\nas introverts reported\nto prefer kinkier sex And\nsurprisingly they were more open\nto trying taboos in the\nbedroom in comparison\nto extroverts Dr. Lehmeler\nexplains the reasons\nbehind this stating\nthat introverts have a harder\ntime establishing the types\nof sexual relationships they\nwant which can increase their\npropensity for developing taboo\nand uncommon sexual interests\nIt just goes to show\nhow different introverts\nand extroverts truly are Foot fetish Okay,\nso a foot fetish may seem\nsuper taboo and deviant\nbut it's actually a very common\nfetish According to research\nby Lehmeler 1 in 14 people\nor 14% report having a foot fetish\nor a sexual fantasy related to feet But\nwhat does fantasizing\nabout feet say about you?\nSimilar to BDSM some people\nmay enjoy a foot fetish when\nthey're either in a\nsubmissive or dominant role\nbecause it triggers arousal\nFor example someone might enjoy\nsomeone else playing with\ntheir feet in a submissive\nposition because it gives\nthem a sense of control\nand power which is something\nthey might crave in their life\noutside the bedroom On\nthe other hand someone\nwho prefers pleasuring\nsomeone's feet in a submissive\nposition might enjoy the feeling\nof being controlled which\ncan stem from early childhood\nexperiences and may\neven be a way of coping\nwith trauma However fantasizing\nabout feet occasionally\ndoesn't necessarily mean you\nhave a full blown foot fetish\nIt just means you've been\nturned on by the idea\nof feet at least once Romance\nand Passion Do you fantasize\nabout having a steamy\nstorybook romance?\nIf this is the case then according\n- To Dr. Lehmiller you\nmight be the more anxious\nand even the needy type He\nsays those who are more likely\nto have romantic and passionate\nimagery in their fantasies\ncould be trying to calm a\nsense of insecurity This type\nof fetish could also be rooted in a fear\nof abandonment which could\nstem from a series of broken\nor disappointing relationships\nthat a person has\nexperienced in real life So\nwhat do you think your\nsexual fantasies are trying\nto tell you about yourself?\nDo you agree with the\ninsights from our video?\nIf you liked this video make sure\nto check out 3 most common\nsexual
