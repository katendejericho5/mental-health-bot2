    "transcript": "- [Narrator] When it\ncomes to relationships,\neveryone has their own\nway of showing love.\nSometimes, these behaviors\nand thought processes\ncan be negative rather than positive.\nAccording to a study,\nchildren who had a secure relationship\nwith their parents growing up\ntend to have better interpersonal\nrelationships later on,\nwhile children who had\nmore unstable relationships\nare more likely to have\nunhealthy behaviors\nand instability in relationships.\nDr. Milan and Kay Yerkovich\ndetermined that there are\nfive different love styles\nthat often are determined\nby your childhood.\nSo what does each love style\nsay about your childhood?\nOne.\nThe avoider.\nPeople with the avoider-type love style\noften come off as distant or unengaged.\nThey don't allow\nthemselves to feel emotions\nin order to protect themselves\nand often feel uncomfortable\nwhen other people around\nthem get emotional.\nAvoiders value their personal\nspace away from other people.\nIf you have the avoider love style,\nas a child, you may\nhave grown up in a home\nthat didn't show a lot of affection,\nthat put more focus on being\nindependent and self-reliant.\nIf you were upset by something,\nyou may not have gotten\nthe comfort you needed,\nwhether it be emotional or physical.\nMaybe at some point,\nyou stopped paying attention\nto your own feelings and needs\nso that you could deal\nwith the stress and anxiety\nfrom having little to no comfort\nfrom your parents or caretakers.\nTwo.\nThe vacillator.\nThe term, vacillate, means to alternate\nor waiver between different\nopinions or actions,\nor in other words, to be indecisive.\nIf you have the\nvacillator-type love style,\nyou may tend to idealize\nnew relationships.\nHowever, when the other person\nshows any trait or behavior\nthat you didn't imagine,\nyou begin to doubt the relationship\nand may even consider ending\nthe relationship altogether.\nAs a child,\nyou probably grew up with\nan unpredictable parent.\nMaybe they were always finding\na reason to leave home,\ngoing out often or\nmeeting new people often,\neven when you needed them.\nWhatever the case may have been,\nyour needs weren't your\nparents' first priority.\nBecause of this,\nyou may have developed\na fear of abandonment\ndue to the fact that you didn't receive\nconsistent affection from your parents.\nAs both a child and an adult,\nyou also probably were very\nsensitive and perceptive,\nnoticing even the slightest sign\nthat someone in your life\nwas distancing themselves.\nThree.\nThe controller.\nIf you have the controller love type,\nyou probably feel the need to\nhave control in a relationship\nto avoid the vulnerable,\nnegative feelings you\nexperienced as a child.\nBy being in control,\nyou can ensure that\nyou limit your exposure\nto feelings like humiliation,\nfear, and helplessness.\nThe one emotion doesn't make\nyou feel vulnerable is anger,\nso you may use anger to\nexpress your emotions.\nYou probably have a particular\nway you like things done,\nand when those expectations aren't met,\nyou may get angry or stressed.\nIf you identify as a controller,\nyou probably grew up in a home\nwhere there wasn't a sense of protection.\nWhen there was some sort\nof harm in your life,\nno one was there to make\nsure you were kept safe.\nYou didn't like stepping\nout of your comfort zone\nand did whatever you could\nto keep yourself from\nexperiencing negative feelings.\nYou learn to be emotionally tough\nand how to take care of yourself\nbecause if you didn't,\nyou were susceptible to being hurt.\nFour.\nThe pleaser.\nSomeone with the pleaser\nlove type has the main focus\nof making sure others\naround them are happy,\neven if it means sacrificing\ntheir own wants and needs\nin order to do so.\nPleasers have a habit\nof monitoring the moods\nof those around them to make\nsure they are kept happy.\nIf someone has a negative change in mood,\nthe pleaser may have an internal struggle\nwith feeling anxious, upset, or stressed.\nIf you're a pleaser,\nyou don't enjoy or handle conflict easily,\nso you may lie or do or say\nwhat the other person wants\njust to avoid conflict.\nIt's often hard for a pleaser to say no.\nAs a child,\nyou grew up with a parent\nwho was overly protective,\nangry, or critical.\nThey may have had overly high standards\nthey wanted you to meet,\nand if you didn't do\nas well as they wanted,\nyou wouldn't get a positive\nresponse from them.\nPeople usually saw you as the good kid.\nRather than receiving\ncomfort from your parents,\nyou may have actually\nbeen giving them comfort\nwhen they were being reactive\nor apologizing for things\nthat were out of your control.\nBecause your parents reacted in such ways,\nyou may have done whatever you could\nto avoid getting a negative\nresponse from them,\neven if it meant lying about something.\nFive.\nThe victim.\nVictims often lack self-worth\nand more than likely suffer\nfrom depression or anxiety.\nRather than living,\nthey just tend to go through the motions.\nIn relationships,\nit's not uncommon for them to\ngravitate toward a controller\nas they mimic what they\nexperienced in childhood.\nVictims are used to complying.\nThey find it easier or even comforting\nto be with a controller in order to get by\nas that's what they're used to.\nIf you have the victim love style,\nyou probably grew up in a chaotic home.\nYou had parents that would\nbe angry or even violent.\nLearning to be compliant\nhelped keep any attention\noff of yourself.\nDid you ever use your imagination\nto escape the negativity surrounding you?\nThat's common with victims\nas being fully present\nis too painful for them.\nThese five love styles help us understand\nmore of the negative\nway we react and behave\nin relationships,\nand also why we are this way\ndue to our childhood experiences.\nDid you relate to any of these styles?\nLeave a comment below\nand let us know if any\nof these love styles\ndescribe you and your childhood.\nIf you find this video insightful,\nshare it with someone who\nwould benefit from it.\nDon't forget to like this video\nand subscribe to Psych2Go\nfor more psychology videos.\nThanks for watching and\nwe will see you soon.\n(lighthearted music)"
