    "transcript": "(gentle music)\n- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nWe wanna thank you all for\nthe support you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nNow let's begin.\nEmotional wellbeing is about\nhow you approach life's problems\nand how you accept and\nmanage your personal feelings\nthrough those changes.\nSo how do you know if\nyou're emotionally healthy\nor unhealthy?\nIf you're more emotionally healthy,\nyou can allow your emotions\nto be more transparent.\nIf you're more emotionally unhealthy,\nyou might be withdrawn and\nsuppress your emotions.\nYou might find it difficult to forgive,\nfeel insecure, and feel like\nyou're running on empty.\nSo with that said,\nhere are five signs you\nare emotionally unhealthy.\nOne, you withdraw from most\nsituations and isolate yourself.\nYou often run to your room at\nthe slightest inconvenience,\nor perhaps you tend to isolate yourself\neven when nothing is seemingly wrong.\nWhile it is good to distance yourself\nfrom unnecessary conflicts\nand take a breather\nevery once in a while,\ntoo much isolation could be\na warning sign of depression.\nWithdrawing from fun activities\nand not socializing\nwith family and friends\ncan lead to loneliness,\nanger, negative thoughts,\nand misunderstanding.\nTwo, you tell yourself you're\nfine even when you're not.\nYou always tell yourself that you're fine\neven when you're not.\nDo you have a habit of\nignoring negative emotions?\nSuppressing emotions may\nseem like an easy, quick fix,\nbut it can also lead\nto emotional outbursts.\nLet's say you suppress your anger\nover the end of a relationship,\nor you're upset with a\nstressful routine at work\nand you don't tell anyone\nhow you're feeling.\nIf you don't deal with your emotions,\nsomething as small as\nforgetting to buy the milk\non the grocery list can\nlead to an explosive fight.\nThree, you hold onto grudges.\nYou find yourself fighting\nwith your enemy in your head,\nlike thinking of comebacks\nto your nasty classmate.\nWhile everyone likes to imagine scenarios\nwhere they win against their tormentors,\nit's important to recognize\nwhen you're thinking about them too much.\nHolding onto anger and resentment\nare heavy weights to carry.\nHolding grudges can lead\nto depression or anxiety.\nYou might bring your bitterness and anger\ninto every new relationship\nand get so wrapped up in the wrong\nthat you can't enjoy your present.\nFour, your insecurities\nget the best of you.\nAre you increasingly\nworried about your flaws?\nDo you fear other\npeople's judgments of you?\nWhen generalized insecurity goes unchecked\nfor a long period of time,\nthe doubt and negative\nfeelings you experience\ncan have a significant\neffect on your life.\nAnd this overwhelming sense\nof insecurity riddles you\nwith negative thoughts on how\nto fit in with your peers,\nreach your goals, or find\nacceptance and support.\nInsecurity is linked to\nmental health conditions,\nsuch as narcissism, anxiety, paranoia,\nand addictive or dependent personalities.\nAnd five, you feel like you're\njust living for the weekend.\nDo you often feel like you're just getting\nthrough your day most of the time?\nEveryone has annoyances\nwith work and school,\nand it's normal to want for\nthe weekend on occasion.\nBut when all you do is\nlive for the weekend,\nthat can signify a deeper problem.\nYou might be feeling\nburned out and frustrated\nand are dealing with a significant amount\nof stress and anxiety.\nWhen you have this\nliving-for-the-weekend type of mentality,\nyou miss out on the other types\nof fulfillment you can get out of the week\nand struggle with unmet needs,\nwhich adds to your stress and frustration.\nDo you struggle with any of these signs\nof emotional unwellness?\nAre there any other signs\nthat you can think of?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you enjoyed watching this video,\ngive us thumbs up and\nshare it with someone\nwho might find it helpful too.\nThe studies and references used are listed\nin the description below.\nDon't forget to hit the subscribe button\nfor more Psych2Go videos,\nand thanks for watching.\nWe'll see you next time."
