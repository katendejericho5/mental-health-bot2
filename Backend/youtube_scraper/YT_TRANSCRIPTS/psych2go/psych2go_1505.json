    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey there, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nHave you heard of the\nnarcissist and empath duo?\nThese people fall under opposite sides\nof the axis of empathy.\nThe narcissist craves excessive\nadmiration from others\nand has an inflated ego,\nwhile the empath is\nsomeone who can perceive\nand even take on others'\nmental or emotional states\nas their own.\nMore on that later.\nBefore we begin,\nplease take note that\nthis video is not made\nto attack anyone who\nmay display these signs,\nor anyone diagnosed\nwith a related disorder,\nbut rather to understand\nthem and bring more awareness\nto the topic.\nSo, what makes this dynamic so painful?\nLet's explore this together.\nNumber one, who are\nnarcissists and empaths?\nFirst let's get to know\nthe two main protagonists.\nNarcissists are people with inflated egos\nand zero empathy towards others.\nThey have a high sense of self-importance,\nan excessive desire for\nattention and admiration,\nand a tainted view of empathy.\nThey crave special treatment\nand will react in rage or outbursts\nif things don't go their way.\nEmpaths, on the other hand,\nare highly sensitive people,\nowning an overabundant supply\nof love and admiration to give.\nThey absorb the emotions of other people\nreadily and compassionately.\nWhat's more, they're\nalso incredibly gifted\nin connecting with another\nperson's thoughts and feelings.\nNumber two, the empath and\nnarcissist at first sight.\nOpposites attract, or so you've been told.\nAt first contact, it may\nfeel as if the two of you\ncomplement each other's needs perfectly.\nAn empath is a natural\nwhen it comes to sharing\nand finds the narcissist\nas the perfect source\nto attune their emotions to.\nA narcissist loves someone who\nwould tolerate their actions.\nThey find in the empath an eager ear,\na constant source of\nappreciation and attention.\nA narcissist excels in drawing the empath,\nwho's willing to listen, all starry-eyed.\nAn empath's emotional needs\nare completely ignored,\nprojecting only themselves\nonto the empaths.\nAn empath is a giver,\nand they give generously.\nA narcissist is a taker, and\nthey always want it their way.\nThe imbalance has begun\nto show already, right?\nNumber three, the poisoned apple.\nSo, why fall for the wrong sort?\nNarcissists hide behind the\nmask of irresistible charm.\nTheir charisma and conduct\non the surface level\ncan draw all sorts of people\nunder their spell, especially empaths.\nThis facade attracts the empath,\nas they find an avenue to\npour all that compassion into.\nA narcissist seems to take\nan empath's genuine\nempathetic world by storm.\nAs emotional sponges,\nthey play right into\nthe narcissist's hands.\nOnce a positive first\nimpression is formed,\nthe empath becomes incredibly\nloyal to the narcissist,\nloyal to a fault.\nOnce a narcissist picks up\non this, they start to reveal\nmore unpleasant sides\nof themselves, uh-oh.\nNumber four, trouble in paradise.\nWhat is essential for love to flourish?\nIs love the only ingredient\nfor a happy relationship?\nBoth these individuals speak\ndifferent love languages.\nWhen put in close affinity,\none has the potential to\nbecome almost parasitic\nfor the other.\nIn a healthy relationship,\nempaths are one of the\nbest types of people\nto foster a relationship with.\nThey care for their partner\nwith all their heart,\nand they always communicate\ntheir feelings openly.\nBut for a narcissist, it's not so easy\nto take into account\nthe feelings of others.\nUnknowingly or otherwise,\nthey're capable of hurting the empath\nas the two operate on very\ndifferent wavelengths.\nOne is ready to bring down the stars,\nwhile the other is only interested\nin demanding more, sigh.\nNumber five, let the chaos games begin!\nPsst! Come closer to your screen.\nLet me tell you a secret, a\nsecret about a hidden gem,\na free hidden gem, something\nthat costs you nothing\nbut will change everything.\nIt also happens to be the\ngreatest mobile game of all time\nand our sponsor today,\n\"Raid Shadow Legends.\"\nWith Halloween around the corner,\n\"Raid's\" spooky Halloween\nchampions are here.\nLet's rank \"Raid's\"

really never been\na better time to get started.\nAnd this month, \"Raid's\"\ngot a non-stop schedule\nof special events and activities,\nincluding an absolutely\njam-packed Halloween lineup\ntowards

as you get in the game.\n(dramatic music)\nHow do narcissists take\nadvantage of empaths?\nOne tactic is a full\nrevelation of their bad side.\nThey start to take advantage\nof the empath in abusive ways,\nrealizing that their harmful tactics\naren't met with any\nstrong opposing reaction\nby the empaths.\nEmpaths are forgiving beings,\nwilling to be patient with\nsomeone else's personal growth.\nThe second tactic is more sinister.\nSome narcissists are strategic,\nand weaponize their use of empathy,\nsprinkling small doses of\ntheir artificial love and charm\nthat the empath first fell in love with.\nThey offer their love only on\nthe condition of compliance.\nSoon, they begin to blame the\nempath for not being perfect,\nbut empaths believe they can fix\nand heal anything with compassion.\nSaying things along the\nlines of \"I'm not perfect\"\ntugs at the heartstrings\nof the over-patient\nand loving empath.\nThis hope of change is enough\nto keep an empath strung\nalong for a long time.\nFor empaths, removing\nsomeone from their lives\ncan be an extremely difficult undertaking.\nThey're true believers of growth and hope,\neven at the expense of their\nown well-being at times.\nNumber six, recipe for disaster.\nWhat makes it problematic?\nWhat an empath needs to\nknow is that narcissists\nare not people that need to be saved,\nnor are they people that\nan empath should adjust to\nin hopes that they can still change.\nNarcissists can actually\nbe perfectly aware\nof their actions, and when they realize\nthat they no longer need you,\nthey'll find it easy to step all over you.\nThey keep track of when the time's right\nto employ a show of empathy\nto keep an empath from finding a reason\nto step out for good.\nThis makes for an extremely\nproblematic relationship\nthat's founded not on\nhealthy, growth-filled love,\nbut rather on a constant\npush-and-pull trauma bond.\nNumber seven, it all ends with self-love.\nSo how can empaths deal with a narcissist?\nThe key is to understand\nthat each is responsible\nfor their own personal growth.\nThe first way an empath can\nshield against a narcissist\nis to say, \"No.\"\nThis in turn establishes boundaries.\nBoundaries are healthy\nfor all relationships,\neven if they feel harsh for\nan empath to build around.\nIt gives them the strength\nto protect themselves\nfrom those looking to\ntake advantage of them.\nThis helps build faith in yourself\nand gain independence emotionally.\nEmotional independence can enable empaths\nto spot signs of abuse and\ngaslighting from the onset,\nhelping themselves save themselves\nfrom impending heartbreak.\nDespite being wrong in all the right ways,\nthe narcissist-empath\nduo is all too common,\nbut that does not make one\nat fault for being taken in.\nWith all the forces against you,\nwhat you do to get yourself\nback at the first hint of it\nis what counts.\nNarcissistic abuse is one\nof the hardest to detect,\nbut once you do,\nyou owe it to yourself to\nacknowledge and deter it.\nThe question here is\nnot why you fell for it,\nbut what you can do to rise from it.\nWere you aware of this tale?\nAre there some chapters\nyou think we missed?\nFeel free to leave a comment\ndown below with your thoughts,\nexperiences, or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with those out
