    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey\nPsych2goers, welcome back.\nWhen was the last time you\nfelt completely at peace\nwith your life and self?\nSometimes our minds can\nlinger in dark spaces\nwith negative influences, like anxiety.\nAre there times when the voice of anxiety\nis louder than your own?\nDoes it become difficult to discern\nbetween thoughts based on reality\nand thoughts that are merely lies,\nclouding your mind?\nIdentifying which thoughts\nare fear-based and false\nis the first step in\nshifting your mindset,\nwhich then helps you shift your self image\nand life as a whole.\nSo with that said, here\nare six common lies\nyour anxiety may try to\ntrick you into believing\nand how you can reframe\nthose thoughts instead.\nNumber one.\nEveryone is focused on your flaws.\nFirst time gym goers are\noften hesitant and timid\ndue to the lack of experience\nand confidence in a new environment.\nThey think they'll stick out\nas the least experienced person\nin the room or that other gym goers\nwill judge them harshly over their body.\nWhat they don't realize,\nis that everyone there is\ntoo focused on themselves\nand improving their own\nbodies to worry about others.\nReplace the gym with other social settings\nand you'll realize the same applies.\nRemember that everyone has\ninsecurities of their own,\nincluding the person\nyou're interacting with.\nReclaim your mental space by\nfocusing on being present,\npresent with your setting\nor the people you're sharing time with.\nYou'll find that the less you focus\non internalizing those negative feelings\nand the more you focus on being yourself,\nregardless of those insecurities,\nthe more confident you'll feel.\nNumber two.\nYou're not ready.\nThink of someone you admire,\nwhether fictional or not.\nIf they refuse their call to action,\nwhether that be accepting an invitation\nto a magical wizarding school\nor volunteering themselves as a tribute\nin the \"Hunger Games\",\nall because they felt\nlike they weren't ready.\nTheir world would be deprived\nof an important contribution.\nWhen faced with a choice\nto take a leap of faith,\nremember that greatness comes when you act\nbefore you feel ready.\nTrust yourself to learn along the way\nand trust that your path\nwill unfold gradually\nas you carry on.\nNumber three.\nYour self-worth should be earned.\nThe only factor that changes\nhow connected you feel\nto your level of self-worth is belief,\nwhich is influenced by\nwhat you've been taught.\nSometimes it's not about\nadding more to your life\nthrough money, accomplishments\nand material possessions\nto feel self-worth.\nSometimes it's about removing\nlimiting thought patterns\nand unlearning the\nbeliefs that convinced you\nto think less of yourself.\nThroughout life, you may be conditioned\nby negative experiences, people or trauma\nto believe that self worth\nis something you must earn\nbefore you're allowed to claim it,\nbut that isn't true.\nWhile there are things you\nshould work hard to earn in life,\nlike a dream job or\nfinancial independence,\nself-worth is a feeling you\ninnately deserve to have.\nNumber four.\nYou must complete X by Y time\nin your life to be successful.\nAre you telling yourself you\nmust reach a certain goal\nat a certain time in your\nlife to be deemed successful\nor do you have a checklist with\nmilestones you'd like to hit\nand are hard on yourself\nfor not making those goals\nwhen you plan to?\nThis lie is exaggerated even further\nwhen you look around and\nfeel as though everyone\nis more successful than you\nor doing better in life than you are.\nThe truth is, everyone\nis on their own timeline\nand life is not a race.\nWhat looks like immediate\nsuccess on the surface\ncould actually be a goal\nthat was years in the making\nfor someone you admire.\nA successful goal is worth celebrating\nno matter how long it takes.\nWhat matters most is your\ndetermination and persistence\nin making it happen.\nNumber five.\nIt or you will always be this way.\nAnxiety can trap your mind in a loop,\ncausing you to believe that its presence\nwill be a constant all your life.\nYour anxiety will lie to you\nby recalling all the times\nyou failed to overcome it.\nYou might think that\nyou'll always feel weak\nin the face of your fears or insecurities,\nbut all of that is part of\nanxiety's negative influence.\nBad memories are more easily\nremembered than good ones\ndue to survival and evolution.\nWhen undergoing a negative experience,\nthe two emotion processing\nregions of the brain\nalerts you to what feels dangerous.\nIn an attempt to protect you,\nyour brain imprints\nthese negative feelings\ninto your memories so that\nyou can better prepare\nfor future possibilities\nof similar experiences.\nFor every negative memory that you have,\ntry thinking about two other\npositive memories as well.\nThis practice will help reframe your past\nin a positive light\nand can encourage a more\noptimistic view of your future.\nAnd number six.\nChange is bad.\nAre you afraid of change?\nMany of us are.\nWe're scared of change because\nof its uncertain nature.\nAnxiety brings this fear to a new level,\nsometimes to the point\nwhere you feel paralyzed.\nA bad breakup two years\nago might leave room\nfor the love of your\nlife to arrive later on.\nNot making the baseball team now\ncould lead you to discover\na passion for a new sport\nand a conflict with a friend\ncould be what deepens your bond with them\nin a way you couldn't\nhave imagined possible.\nChange can be good, as\nlong as you allow it.\nSo did you relate to any of these?\nWhen these thoughts or lies arise,\ndon't force yourself to fight them off\nif that proves to be a challenge at first.\nAllow them to appear like\nclouds forming in the sky,\nwatch them pass through your\nmind and let them float away.\nYou don't have to believe\nor hold onto any of them.\nWith practice, you'll find they float\ninto your mental space less and less.\nKnow that these thoughts are not your own\nand that there is an inner\nvoice encouraging you\nwith positivity underneath\nthose fear-ridden thoughts.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nlike and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this too.\nRemember to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for
