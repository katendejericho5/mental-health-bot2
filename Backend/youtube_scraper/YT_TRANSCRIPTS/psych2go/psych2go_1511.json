    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey you Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nAttention Deficit\nHyperactivity Disorder or ADHD\nis a disorder marked by an\nongoing pattern of inattention\nor hyperactivity that interferes\nwith functioning and development.\nIt can make focusing on everyday tasks\nand routine challenging.\nADHD doesn't mean that you cannot focus.\nIn some cases, it means\nthat you focus intensely\non something that may not be a priority.\nSome people describe it\nas a constant feeling of\nbeing overwhelmed or paranoid.\nFor years, people with\nADHD were stigmatized\nand labeled as lazy, procrastinators,\nflaky or irresponsible.\nThese labels only produce shame\nand prevent those with\nADHD from seeking help.\nBut please remember that these labels\ndo not represent who you are.\nBefore we begin, remember that this video\nis for educational purposes only,\nand is not intended\nto be a substitute for\nprofessional advice,\ndiagnosis or treatment.\nWith that said, here are five signs\nyou might have ADHD.\nNumber one, childhood history.\nIt's common for people\ndiagnosed with ADHD as adults\nto have exhibited\nsymptoms during childhood,\neven if they were not formally diagnosed.\nA reason you may not have been diagnosed\nis that ADHD shares similar\nsymptoms with depression,\nmood swings, forgetfulness,\nand an inability to focus.\nNumber two, short attention span.\nSpeaking of similarities\nbetween ADHD and depression,\nthe most common similarity\nis short attention span.\nHowever, the difference\nbetween them is motivation.\nSomeone with ADHD has\na short attention span\nas a result of the condition.\nThere is no definitive reason\nto explain why a short attention span\nis one of the symptoms.\nHowever, researchers believe\nthat differences in brain\nstructure might play a role.\nIt's not that you're\nincapable of being focused.\nIt's that something else\ncaught your brain's attention.\nADHD can also make you\nhyper focused on something.\nIt sounds paradoxical,\nbut this too is seen as\nhaving a short attention span\nor to restate, a selective attention span.\nNumber three, leaving things unfinished.\nAs a result of a short attention span,\nyou might be prone to\nleaving things undone.\nProjects, housework,\nhomework might be put off\nfor another day or fall to the sidelines,\nregardless of how enthusiastic\nyou are to start them.\nThough frustrating and\nincredibly challenging,\nthere are therapies that can help.\nDoctors typically prescribe medication\nas a form of treatment.\nDepending on your ADHD,\nthey may prescribe stimulants\nor non-stimulants to help you focus.\nThere is also the option of psychotherapy\nwhere a therapist might\nengage in behavioral therapy\nor cognitive behavioral therapy.\nNumber four, poor impulse control.\nAnother sign that you might have ADHD\nis poor impulse control.\nNow this wouldn't be a\none-off clothing splurge.\nThis is more like doing something\nyou know you should not do,\nlike running a red light\nor maxing out your card on something\nyou know you don't need.\nYou may not even know why you do things.\nYou just do them.\nThat's what poor impulse control is.\nIt's acting without any foresight.\nBut impulse control is\nnot always as dramatic.\nSometimes it can be as\nsubtle as having distractions\nfor your distractions,\ninterrupting conversations,\nengaging in risky behaviors\nor spending large amounts of money\nwhen your bank account is low.\nNumber five, inability to get organized.\nThe last time that you might have ADHD\nis that you cannot seem to get organized.\nDeadlines creep up out of the blue\nand priorities have gone out the window,\nbut do not fret.\nThere is hope.\nWhile calendar, planners\nand bullet journals\nmay work for some,\nthey may not work in your case.\nHowever, alarms may help.\nGive yourself 30 minutes to an hour\nto complete something\nfrom your to do list.\nAfter the alarm rings,\nmove on to the next item,\nwhether you finished the\nprevious item or not.\nThat way you don't get\nstuck working on one thing.\nSo did you relate to any of these signs?\nI did.\nWe hope you've learned\nabout some of the different signs of ADHD.\nConsult a mental health professional\nif you identify with these signs.\nThey can guide you\nthrough forms of therapy\nthat can be greatly beneficial.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find some\ninsight in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used\nare added in the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching,\nand we'll see you next time."
