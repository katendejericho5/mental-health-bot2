    "transcript": "- [Mithrilda] Hi, Psych2Goers,\nand to welcome back to another video.\nHow do you define intelligence?\nWhy do you refer to some\nas highly intelligent?\nEver wondered what they\ndo that sets them apart?\nThey often seem to be shrouded in mystery,\nas no one can pinpoint\nthe secret ingredient\nin their cauldron of intelligence.\nMost of the time, being highly successful\nis linked to being highly intelligent.\nHowever, there's more\nto it than just that.\nTo help you learn from\nthe masters themselves,\nhere are seven habits\nthat highly intelligent people practice.\nOne, you treat every situation\nas a learning experience.\nDo you feel like you\ncould learn something new\nfrom every situation you face?\nHighly intelligent people\nlet no opportunity for\nlearning go to waste.\nThey are constantly on the lookout\nfor things that might\nadd to their knowledge.\nIf you are a highly intelligent person,\nthen you will value\nany and every situation\nthat you come across as\nvaluable information,\neven when you talk with someone\nwho is not very intelligent,\ninstead of trying to show your\nsuperiority with information\nthat you have already learned over time,\nyou try to absorb\neverything they tell you.\nTwo, you try to figure\nthings out by yourself.\nDo you usually try to solve things first\nbefore asking for help from others?\nAs a highly intelligent person,\nyou have the habit of\ntrying to figure things out\nby yourself before asking for help.\nYou find value in struggling first,\nbecause of the lessons that you can learn\nfrom tackling problems on your own.\nYou know that letting\nother people help you\nwithout trying first will result\nin a high degree of dependency.\nThree, you ask a lot of questions.\nIs the question mark a common occurrence\nat the end of your sentences?\nIf you are constantly asking questions,\nand digging deeper than the usual person,\nthen you most likely\nare highly intelligent.\nThis allows you to have\na better perspective\nof how the world works,\nand even learn things\nthat you never imagined\nyou would learn.\nFour, you learn best by imitation.\nHow would you rate your\nobservation skills?\nDo you feel like you\ncan learn things better\nwhen you see someone do them first?\nThis is a habit that highly\nintelligent people have.\nEveryone has a different way of learning,\nbut you feel like the best way for you\nis to watch someone who knows do it first.\nYou study the existing methods first,\nand then you let your ideas\nand creativity take over,\nmaking slight modifications\nto a verified method,\ncoming up with innovative thoughts.\nFive, you exercise daily.\nDo you prioritize physical\nexercise in your daily routine?\nHow often do you work out?\nSimilar to how intelligent people\nprioritize good sleep in their routine,\ndeveloping the habit of exercising daily\nis important as well.\nYou are aware of the health benefits\nthat daily exercise can bring to you.\nExercising reduces your\nrisk of heart disease,\ncontrols your weight, regulates\nyour body's blood sugar\nand insulin levels, et cetera.\nBeing both physically and mentally healthy\nis an important aspect\nof being productive,\nand can really affect\nhow you develop your creative\nthoughts on a daily basis.\nSix, you simplify your\nroutine as much as possible.\nDo you strive to cut\ndown every trivial task\nfrom your daily routine?\nIs the bulk of your to-do\nlists checked already?\nHighly intelligent people\nare known to have very\nsimplistic schedules.\nYou have the habit of eliminating\nunnecessary complexity\nfrom your life.\nSince simplicity allows\nyou to be as productive\nand efficient as possible.\nOnly focusing your time\nand effort on the things\nthat you consider most important\nwill surely allow you to\nreach the highest potential\nof your intelligence.\nSeven, you make everyone\naround you feel smart.\nDo you tend to praise other\npeople's intelligence?\nThis is a habit that highly\nintelligent people have.\nIf you tend to praise other\npeople's intelligence,\ninstead of looking down on people,\njust because you already\nknew what they discovered,\nthen you have a habit\nthat most highly intelligent people have.\nYou know that praising them\nwill have many more benefits\nthan just underestimating\nor belittling them.\nTo conclude, if you\nshare any of the habits\nof highly intelligent people,\nyou are most likely one\nstep closer to success.\nAnd even if you don't, having\nthe mindset of trying to learn\nwill surely result in\nroom for improvement.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some effective habits\nof intelligent people.\nDo any of these describe\nyour experience with them?\nOr did any of these points describe you?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them\nif you'd like.\nPlease feel free to share any\nthoughts you have as well.\nIf you find
