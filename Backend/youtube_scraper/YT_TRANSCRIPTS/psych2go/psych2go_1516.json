    "transcript": "One, you feel unworthy.\nAt times,\ndo you find yourself thinking,\nnone of my friends like me?\nOr they only invited me\nbecause they'd feel bad\nif they didn't?\nIn reality, it is far from the truth.\nWhen dealing with depression,\nfeelings of unworthiness and inadequacy\ncan very easily cloud your thoughts\nwith negative, destructive ones.\nIt deflates your self-esteem,\nleading to the belief that others see you\nthe same negative way you see yourself.\nEven when your closest friends and family\nhave pure intentions,\nsending you invites to parties,\nasking you to go on girls' night out\nor calling to check up on you,\nit can feel like they're doing it\nonly as a way to protect your feelings\nand avoid making you feel hurt\nand left out.\nOpening up and expressing\nyour true feelings\ncan be difficult for you,\nbecause it feels like no\none understands the pain\nyou're going through.\nTwo, you lack energy.\nDepression can be draining.\nOne of the many symptoms of depression\nis feeling worn out,\nboth physically and mentally.\nAccording to the US National\nInstitutes of Health's\nNational Library of Medicine,\none of the most common residual symptoms\nof partially-resolved\ndepression is fatigue.\nBroadly defined,\nsymptoms of fatigue can affect physical,\ncognitive and emotional function,\nimpair school and work performance,\nand disturb social and\nfamily relationships.\nFor people with depression,\nit can be hard to find the\nwill to get up in the morning,\nlet alone find the energy\nto go out and spend time\nwith others.\nIt is way easier to just stay in,\nrather than muster energy to socialize.\nDepending on the severity\nof your depression,\ndoing just about anything at all\ncan feel more energy-consuming\nthan it normally would.\nWith that said,\nif you or a loved one\nstruggles with depression,\nit's completely understandable\nto feel this way.\nThree, you struggle to find time.\nDepression is notorious\nfor giving its victims\na hard time with time management.\nIs your work or school load\nharder to manage than before?\nDepression severely\naffects your motivation,\nand productivity levels.\nAll of a sudden,\nyou have no energy left\nto get things done.\nAnd this ultimately has a snowball effect\non your to-do list,\nturning it into a never-ending scribble\nof more and more tasks each day.\nThis amplifies depression\nsymptoms of stress,\nfeeling overwhelmed\nand burnout in general,\ngiving you almost little to\nno time for a social life,\nas you struggle to get\nenough things done already.\nFour, you struggle from social anhedonia.\nDo you feel like the company of others\ndoesn't bring you the same\npositive feelings of satisfaction\nor enjoyment as it did before?\nHas spending the holidays with family,\nlunch breaks with your\ncoworkers or even dates\nwith your significant\nother lost its charm?\nAnhedonia or the\ninability to feel pleasure\nis something people with\ndepression may struggle with.\nSocial anhedonia is a\nform of this condition\nthat refers to one's\ndetachment from socialization\ndue to the absence of\npleasure they feel from it.\nWhile everyone's experiences\nmay vary from each other,\nsocial anhedonia can be very stressful.\nYou might still crave\nforming and maintaining deep,\nmeaningful relationships\nwith other people,\nbut social anhedonia\nprevents you from doing so.\nOver time, this could lead to self-blame\nfor your feelings of\nloneliness and isolation.\nFive, you have a history\nof social anxiety.\nAccording to research,\nthere's a strong link\nbetween social anxiety disorder, or SAD\nand future depression,\nmaking people diagnosed with SAD\nprone to depressive-like tendencies.\nIf you or a loved one has\nalready been diagnosed\nwith social anxiety, the\npresence of depression\nin your or their life\ncan further reinforce these anti-social\nand self-isolating habits.\nAlong with depression, social anxiety\nis another common mental health condition\nthat goes beyond a person's\nquality of shyness.\nIt hinders your ability to\ndo even the smallest acts,\nlike making eye contact\nwith others or being present\nin a populated room\nwithout feeling uneasy.\nIt only furthers your need\nto withdraw from others.\nSocial withdrawal along with\nother depressive symptoms\nis not your fault,\nnor does it make you less worthy.\nSuch unintentional actions are driven\nby your depressed mental state\nand not by actual feelings\nyou hold within your heart.\nSocialization isn't all\nabout just making small talk\nwith others or making new friends,\nit's also about accepting support\nfrom loved ones and opening\nup about your struggles\nto people you trust.\nIt's important to remember,\nyou're not alone\nand that reaching or opening\nup to a friend, family member\nor a mental health professional\ncan be the first step of many\ntowards self-improvement.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the reasons why depression\ncan lead to social withdrawal.\nDo you find these relatable?\nLet us know in the comments
