    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever wondered what\nmakes people light up the room?\nIs it their charming good\nlooks, their sense of humor,\nor something else entirely?\nYour likeability can be\nperceived differently\nby different people.\nWhile you can't be liked\nby everyone all the time,\nthere are a few subtle\nthings that you can do\nto make people feel more\nopen and warm towards you.\nSo with that said, here are six habits\nthat make others like you.\nNumber one, spend time with them.\nTo get people to like\nyou, you have to do more\nthan watch them from afar.\nSpend time and find common ground\nwith the person you'd like to know.\nAsk your classmates if they\nwanna hang out after school.\nOr chat with a coworker\nduring your coffee break.\nthis reinforces what is known\nas the familiarity principle,\nor the attraction we get\ntowards people and objects\nthat we see regularly.\nNumber two, own your flaws.\nDo you feel like you have\nto be your perfect self\nin front of others?\nSurprisingly, that may backfire.\nA person who shows their\nbest self in front of others\ncan come across as artificial,\nand therefore unlikable.\nOn the other hand,\nshowing some of your flaws\nor committing small mistakes\nhumanizes you, making you more attractive.\nThis is called the pratfall effect,\npopularized by a social\npsychologist, Elliot Aronson.\nJust like how it's fun for us\nto watch celebrities eating\nat your local fast food\nplace, you can be more likable\nif you show mundane aspects of yourself,\neven if that means\ncommitting trivial mistakes.\nNumber three, mirror them.\nDid you know that copying\nanother person's mannerisms\ncan make you more likable?\nIt's true.\nIn a study conducted by New\nYork University researchers,\nthey asked 72 people to work\non a task with their partners.\nAfterwards, the participants\nwere asked to rank\nhow likable their partners were.\nUnsurprisingly, those who\nmirrored their partners\nwere more likely to be considered likable\nthan those who didn't.\nSo if you want to get\non someone's good side,\nsubtly copy their mannerisms.\nJust don't go too overboard\nby copying their every move.\nA couple of natural touches\nhere or there is just fine.\nNumber four, be generous\nwith your compliments.\nWhen in doubt, say a genuine compliment.\nTelling your new friend\nthat their hair is pretty\nor they're rocking a great new look\nhelps them feel appreciated.\nThe way you describe others is\nhow they'll see you as well.\nThis is called spontaneous\ntrait transference,\nand can be a great way to\nmake a good impression.\nFor example, if you're at a party\nand you compliment the\nhost's people skills\nto a new acquaintance,\nthey will naturally think\nthat you're quite a people person as well.\nOn the other hand,\nif you complain about how lazy someone is,\nall while you show that\nyou don't help others,\npeople will find it easy\nto make the connection\nthat you're lazy as well.\nSo watch your language\nand give compliments\nwhenever you can.\nNumber five, emphasize your shared values.\nAre you drawn to someone\nbecause of what they stand for?\nIf yes, don't shy away from\nemphasizing your shared values.\nThis practice is what is called\nthe similarity-attraction effect,\nor the natural gravitation\nof people towards others\nwho share similar qualities.\nAccording to a study by Theodore Newcomb,\npeople who share similar\nviewpoints in controversial topics,\nlike politics, tend to\nlike each other more,\neven if they started off as strangers.\nAnd number six, tell\nthem something personal.\nDo you wanna get closer to someone\nat a more intimate level?\nShare something personal with them.\nIn a study led by researchers\nat the State University of\nNew York at Stony Brook,\ncollege-aged students were paired off\nand given a series of\nquestions to ask each other.\nOne, small talk, and the other,\nmore intermediate level topics.\nBy the end of the 45-minute session,\nthose who asked more personal questions\nfelt closer to each other than\nthose who just participated\nin small talk.\nSo if you wanna get closer to people,\nskip the what's your favorite class,\nand don't be afraid to jump\ninto more intimate topics\nlike dreams or what\nmeans the most to them.\nAre there any tips that we missed?\nAre you planning to follow\nany of the tips above\nto get more people to like you?\nLet us know your stories in\nthe comment section below.\nAs always, the references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nAnd remember to like and\nshare this video with others\nwho might enjoy it.\nThanks so much for watching,\nand we'll see you next time."
