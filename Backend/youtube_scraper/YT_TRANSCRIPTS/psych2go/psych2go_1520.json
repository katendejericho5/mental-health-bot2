    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2Goers.\nDo you get anxious a lot?\nWhile anxiety is a\nnormal response to stress\nas it's your body's way to tell you\nthat there is danger ahead,\nthere is a difference\nbetween feeling a little\njittery and nervous\nand experiencing overwhelming panic.\nWhen your symptoms start to be excessive,\nlasting for six months or more\nand you feel like it's consumed your life,\nthen your anxiety may\nbe becoming more serious\nand you may have an anxiety disorder.\nBut whether you experience\nsubtle signs of anxiety\nor are struggling with\nan anxiety disorder,\nyou can reap some benefits\nwhen you fuel your body\nwith the right kinds of food.\nSo, here are seven\nfoods to reduce anxiety.\nNumber one, Brazil nuts.\nDo you snack a lot?\nIn places where there is\nadequate selenium content\nin the soil, Brazil nuts become\nwonderful organic sources\nof selenium.\nA study done by Benton and Cook showed\nthat there is a correlation\nbetween a person's change in mood\nand the level of selenium in their diet.\nIn this study, a sample of\n50 subjects were supplied\nwith a selenium supplement for five weeks.\nThey were divided into two groups,\nin which they either received a placebo\nor 100 micrograms of selenium every day,\nand were required\nto fill in the food\nfrequency questionnaire\nto approximate the dietary\nintake of selenium.\nDuring this five-week\nspan of selenium therapy,\nwhen the level of dietary\nselenium decreased,\nthere would be more reports of anxiety,\ndepression, and tiredness.\nIt is crucial to note that\nconsuming selenium in excess\ncan lead to side effects.\nAn adult is recommended\nto take up to 400 micrograms per day.\nTherefore you need to be\nvigilant not to take high doses\nof selenium supplements\nor consume more than three\nto four Brazil nuts a day.\nNumber two, fatty fish.\nDo you know that fatty fish like salmon,\nmackerel, sardines, trout,\nand herring are rich sources\nof omega-3?\nThe omega-3 rich foods contain\nalpha-linolenic acid, ALA,\nwhich provides two essential fatty acids,\neicosapentaenoic acid, EPA,\nand docosahexaenoic acid, DHA.\nThese enable neurotransmitter regulation,\nreduce inflammation, and\nencourage healthy brain function,\nwhich have potential preventative\nand therapeutic effects\non psychiatry disorders, such\nas anxiety and depression.\nAccording to a systematic\nreview and meta-analysis study\npublished in JAMA,\nthere was an association between\nthe intake of omega-3 PUFAs\nand a significant reduction\nin anxiety symptoms\ncompared with controls.\nApart from that,\nthere was a significantly\nhigher association of treatment\nwith reduced anxiety\nsymptoms of omega-3 PUFA\nin subgroups with specific\nclinical conditions\nthan in subgroups without\nclinical diagnosis.\nNumber three, dark chocolate.\nDoes it feel instantly better\nwhen you munch on some dark chocolate\nwhen you're feeling down?\nIn a study published\nin the International\nJournal of Health Sciences,\nthe daily consumption of 40\ngrams of dark and milk chocolate\nby female students during\na period of two weeks\nwas effective in decreasing\ntheir level of perceived stress.\nIt's actually unclear as\nto how the consumption\nof dark chocolate leads\nto stress reduction.\nHowever, it is important\nto note that dark chocolate\nis a rich source of polyphenols,\nespecially flavonoids.\nAnd according to a 2016\nstudy done by Shun-Chiao,\nflavonoids might reduce neuroinflammation,\ncell death in the brain,\nand improve blood flow.\nNumber four, turmeric.\nHave you ever tried Indian turmeric rice?\nTurmeric is a common spice used in Indian\nand Southeast Asian cooking.\nIt has a warm, bitter taste\nand is usually used to flavor\nor color curry powders,\nmustards, butters, and cheese.\nThis spice contains a\nchemical called curcumin,\nwhich may reduce inflammation\nand oxidative stress\nand help lower anxiety.\nNumber five, chamomile.\nDo you often make yourself\na cup of hot chamomile tea\nwhen you're feeling a little stressed?\nChamomile tea can sometimes\nbe a herbal remedy\ndue to its anti-inflammatory,\nantibacterial,\nantioxidant, and relaxant properties.\nAccording to a randomized\nclinical trial done by Mao,\nthere was a significant reduction\nof moderate to severe generalized\nanxiety disorder symptoms\nfor those long-term chamomile consumers.\nHowever, it did not significantly\nreduce the rate of relapse\nor psychiatry disorders.\nNumber six, yogurt.\nDid you know healthful\nbacteria such as lactobacillus\nand bifidobacteria can be found in yogurt?\nIt's reported that these\nbacteria in fermented foods\nsuch as cheese,\nsauerkraut, kimchi, and\nfermented soy products\ncan amplify the specific nutrient\nand phytochemical content of foods,\nand affect the brain health via direct\nand indirect pathways.\nAccording to a study done by Hilimire,\nDeVylder, and Forestell,\nthere was a correlation\nbetween higher frequency\nand fermented food consumption\nand fewer symptoms of social anxiety.\nIt's also stated that for\nthose at a higher genetic risk,\nas indexed by trait neuroticism,\nfermented foods that contain probiotics\nmay have a protective effect\nagainst social anxiety symptoms.\nAnd number seven, green tea.\nIs it relaxing for you\nto drink a cup of tea?\nGreen tea contains an\namino acid called theanine,\nwhich has a potential\neffect on mood disorders.\nWhen drinking green tea,\nthe production of serotonin\nand dopamine may increase,\nwhich may help reduce your anxiety.\nA review by Dietz and Decker reported\nthat L-theanine alone improved\nself-reported relaxation,\ntension, and calmness,\nstarting at 200 milligrams.\nThe combination of L-theanine\nand caffeine were found\nto exceptionally improve performance\nand attention-switching\ntasks and alertness,\nbut to a lesser extent\nthan caffeine alone.\nHave you tried these foods?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who might benefit from it.\nAnd
