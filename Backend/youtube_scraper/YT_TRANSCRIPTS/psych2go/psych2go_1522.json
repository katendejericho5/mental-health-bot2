    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psycho2Goers.\nDo you know someone who\nstruggles with depression\nor are you struggling yourself\nand not sure how to\ndifferentiate your sadness\nfrom depression?\nHere are signs of someone\nwho grew up with depression.\nNumber one, thinking they're\nto blame for everything.\nDo they blame themselves for\nevery relationship conflict?\nIt's noble to hold yourself responsible\nfor the wrongdoings that\nyou've done in the past.\nWhen a misaligned virtuousness\ncan be just as damaging as not\nfacing the conflict at all.\nAccording to a study by\na group of psychologists\nled by Roland Zahn,\nself-blaming tendencies occur\nin over 80% of the\npatients they've screened.\nSimilarly, 85% of the\npeople in the same test\nbelieve that these self-blaming emotions\nare the most bothersome to deal with.\nWhile you may feel that\nyou're taking responsibility\nby self-blaming, you're\ndoing the exact opposite.\nYou are unconsciously\nstonewalling yourself\nby not being vulnerable\nto your shortcomings.\nInstead of blaming yourself,\nyou may find growth in finding\na professional to talk to\nabout these problems if\nyou still exhibit them.\nNumber two,\nhave physical pains with\nno clear underlying cause.\nDoes your friend complain\nabout random aches and pains\nwith no clear reason?\nIf yes,\nit may be a sign that they're\ntrying to signal to you\nabout their internal state.\nAccording to Juli Fraga,\na doctor of psychology,\nthe connection between\nphysical pain and depression\nis more common in Asian cultures\nas they're likely to describe depression\nas pains in their physical body.\nThese symptoms manifest as\ndecreased pain tolerance,\nunbearable fatigue, headaches\nand stomach uneasiness.\nIf someone has these issues in any case,\nit's good to talk to a doctor about it.\nNumber three, anger and tantrums.\nWhile not as common as\nshame and low self-worth,\nlong-term anger can be an\nuncommon yet telltale sign\nof people suffering from depression.\nDepression is oftentimes referred to\nas anger turned inwards,\nsince it reflects an overly critical voice\nthat makes it hard for you to move past\ndiminished self-worth and shame.\nStaying overly angry\nforces your mind to\nthink of the negatives.\nThis not only worsens the\nseverity of depression,\nbut it can also appear\nas outward manifestations\nof those emotions causing a vicious cycle\nwhere you hurt the important\npeople in your life\nwhen you need them the most.\nNumber four, they were an outcast.\nDo they have a hard time\nconnecting with others\nand maintaining long\nlasting relationships?\nAccording to John Cacioppo,\nloneliness sounds the same alarm bells\nas when we feel thirst,\nhunger and physical pain.\nHe also states that\nthe American Association\nof Retired Persons or AARP\nconducted a study on American participants\nand found that around 40\nto 45% of the population\nfeel lonely in the past decade,\nan increase from 11 to\n20% during the 1970s.\nBut what causes it and how\ndoes it cause depression?\nLoneliness is caused by\nmany things like heredity,\nour environment, circumstances,\nand our attitudes.\nLacking social connections can\nlower yourself forth as well,\namplifying your critical voice.\nTo help a lonely friend,\nsend them a comforting\ntext or give them a call.\nEven if they don't wanna\npick up the phone at first,\nit will be comforting\nfor your friend to know\nthat you're there for them.\nNumber five, lack of motivation.\nDo they lack the motivation\nto get up from bed\nin the morning and go to school?\nLacking motivation\ncan impede you from\naccomplishing your goals.\nThe lack of motivation is\nnot the main issue here,\nbut rather an underlying problem\nthat's causing you to lack\nmotivation in the first place.\nAre you stuck in a situation\nthat you'd rather not be in?\nDo you feel that you\ncan't commit to one thing?\nBy pinpointing the main cause\nof your lack of motivation,\nyou can come up with a plan\nof action to become better,\nothers by improving yourself\nin small gradual steps\nor getting out of a bad situation.\nAnd number six,\nthey express hopelessness\nabout their future.\nDo they feel like they have\nnothing to look forward to\nbecause they feel stuck in a rut?\nThis may be hopelessness depression.\nLyn Abramson,\na professor of psychology at\nthe University of Wisconsin,\nMadison,\nsays that repeated exposure\nto perceived uncomfortable circumstances\nand negative stimuli leads\nto a sense of helplessness.\nThis helplessness\nin turn can spiral into a\nnegative worldview and depression.\nA lot of this has to do\nwith how our mind works.\nIf your mind assumes that an\nargument with an acquaintance\nwas due to your own shortcomings,\ncausing them to never\nwanna associate with you,\ntherefore ruining your reputation,\nyou'll likely suffer from helplessness.\nOn the other hand,\nif you believe that their\nirritability is temporary\nand won't lead to actual adverse effects,\nyou won't be affected as much.\nIf you're still struggling today,\nwe hope that you can find\na little bit of positivity\nthrough the little things,\nwhether it's your pet, a walk in the park\nor the lovely people in\nthe most unexpected places.\nCan you relate to any of the\nthings discussed in
