    "transcript": "- This is an open letter\nto all parents and parents-to-be.\nFirst of all, let us start by saying\nthat being a parent is\nby no means an easy feat.\nSo if you yourself are a\nparent, an expecting parent\nor still thinking of being a parent,\nknow that it takes\nsomeone truly remarkable\nto provide for a family,\nlook after a child\nand keep a household running smoothly.\nAs American comedian and\nactor Matt Walsh once said,\n\"Parenting is the easiest\nthing in the world\nto have an opinion on,\nbut the hardest thing to do.\"\nSo while it's certainly not anyone's place\nto tell you what you\nshould and shouldn't do\nwhen parenting your child,\nwe hope you're doing it\nfor the right reasons.\nAll too often, people make the mistake\nof having children because they feel empty\nand want to be needed\nor are terrified of growing old alone\nand want someone around\nto take care of them when the time comes.\nMaybe all their friends\nare married with kids now\nand they feel pressure to\ndo the same or they think\nthat having a child will\nsave their failing marriage,\nbut children are not safety\nblankets or retirement plans.\nThey are not made to\nmend broken relationships\nor make you feel whole\nor save you from your own personal hell.\nYour children deserve to\nbe loved for who they are\nand who they'll grow up to be,\nnot for the role you want\nthem to play in your life.\nYou are the one who chose\nto bring them into this\nworld and into your life\nand for that you owe them\neverything you can give\nwith no expectations\nof anything in return.\nYou can raise them to share your beliefs\nand your values, but beyond that,\nthey deserve to be their own person\nwith their own feelings and\nexperiences and opinions.\nSo let them have their own dreams,\nmake their own mistakes and\nwalk their own path in life.\nIt's all you can do as a\nparent to let them go someday\nand trust that your children\nwill find their own way back to you.\nSo don't take whatever precious\ntime you still have left\nwith them for granted.\nBe there for them in every way you can,\nto love and support and guide them as best\nand as wholeheartedly as you are able.\nIt's not gonna be easy,\nbut you need to give it your\nbest try each and every day.\nStrive to be someone they can look up to\nand turn to for comfort and advice.\nBe there to celebrate every victory\nand soften the blow of every failure.\nShow up to every game and\nrecital and award ceremony.\nHelp them with their homework\nand eat dinner together every night.\nPatch up every scraped\nknee or broken heart\nand in the hustle and bustle\nof all that is parenting,\ndon't forget to take care of yourself\nand have a life outside\nof your children too.\nYou owe it to them not to fall apart\nor feel adrift the moment they're gone.\nSo have your own hobbies and interests.\nSpend time with your\nown friends and family\nand achieve your own\npersonal goals and ambitions.\nDon't tie your entire sense of purpose\nand identity around being a parent.\nYou can't put that burden on\nyour children's shoulders,\nno matter how easy it might\nbe to neglect yourself\nonce you have someone\nelse to take care of.\nIt is hard to be a parent\nand have your own life\noutside of your kids.\nYou might feel guilty or\nselfish for even trying,\nbut always remember that you're not alone\nand that it's okay to take\na break and ask other people\nfor help from time to time.\nDo you feel burnt out\nand always in a bad mood?\nDo you have an important work deadline\nthat needs your attention?\nThat's okay.\nYou're not going to be the bad guy\njust because you wanna take\na few days off for yourself\nand as long as your kids\ncan see that you're trying,\nthey'll love you all the same.\nSo be kind to yourself.\nTo quote acclaimed novelist\nand political activist Ann Lamott,\n\"There are places in the heart\nthat you don't even know\nexist until you have a child.\"\nSo if you're a parent or a future parent,\ndid you appreciate the\nmessage in this video?\nBeing a parent will always\nhave many ups and downs.\nThe journey you're on isn't\ngoing to be an easy one,\nbut it's gonna be worth it.\nThis video is a little\ndifferent from our usual format,\nso what did you think?\nIf you have any suggestions,\nlet us know in the comments below.\nDid you find this video helpful?\nTell us in the comments.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find value in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you next time.\n(light music)"
