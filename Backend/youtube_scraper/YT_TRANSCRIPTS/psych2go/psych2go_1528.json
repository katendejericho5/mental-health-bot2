    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hi, Psych2Goers,\nand welcome back to another video.\nHave you ever been betrayed?\nDid you see it coming?\nIf not, do you ever wish you\ncould've known beforehand\nif someone was going to betray you?\nAs much as you wanna give\npeople the benefit of the doubt,\nbeing betrayed is more common\nthan you would like to think.\nBetween romantic and\nplatonic relationships,\nhave you ever felt like\nbetrayal is unavoidable?\nWhile you can't control\nhow other people act,\ndid you know that there\nare always ways to tell\nwhen someone is going to betray you?\nThey're subtle and easy to miss\nif you don't know what to look for,\nso here are nine signs someone\nis about to betray you.\nNumber one, they're only there\nwhen it's convenient for them.\nHave you ever had a\nfriend that was only there\nwhenever there was something they wanted?\nThey're there for you\nwhen you're having fun,\nbut the second you need\ntheir comfort and support,\nthey're suddenly busy.\nWhile it's hard to accept,\npeople who do this generally don't care\nabout you or your feelings.\nThey're not real friends,\nmeaning they're likely to betray you\nwhen there's nothing else to gain.\nYikes.\nWhen you notice someone doing this to you,\nyou may want to reconsider your friendship\nand find some friends who truly care.\nNumber two, they've begun\nto act out of character.\nHave you ever thought you knew someone\nonly to see them start doing\nthings you never expected?\nFor example, your shy and reserved friend\nsuddenly begins to hang out\nwith a more popular friend group,\nso their behavior and\nmannerisms transform completely.\nWhile people change every day,\nsudden and drastic changes could mean\nthat they have reinvented themselves\nand aren't the same person they once were.\nThey could be more inclined to betray you\nas part of their new persona.\nWatch out.\nNumber three, they've begun to\ndistance themselves from you.\nHave you ever noticed anyone\npulling away from you?\nIt could be making up excuses to avoid you\nor unfollowing you on social media, even.\nWhile there could be\nother reasons for this,\nit's a big sign they're\npreparing to betray you.\nPutting distance between\nyou two generally means\nthey're becoming less\nemotionally invested in you,\nmeaning they could be pulling away\nto avoid the guilt of\nbetraying you afterwards.\nHow nice of them. (scoffs)\nNumber four, they begin to give you\nunderhanded, insincere compliments.\nHas anyone ever said the following to you?\n\"You, uh, actually look nice today,\"\nor, \"I would have never expected it,\nbut you did surprisingly well.\"\nWait, what?\nWhile they may sound like compliments,\nif you look a little deeper\nthey're underhanded jabs.\nPeople often speak this way\nwhen they're jealous of you\nand want to bring you down\nwithout being obvious about it.\nIf you've noticed someone doing this,\nit's likely they don't really like you\nand are more inclined to betray you.\nNumber five, they talk badly\nabout you behind your back.\nHave you ever accidentally\nheard someone gossiping about you?\nWas it a friend who\ngossips about others to you\nbut you never thought they'd\ntreat you the same way?\nMuch like giving insincere compliments,\nsomeone insulting you behind your back\nis a huge sign they're jealous of you\nand are trying to get others\nto dislike you as well.\nIt's not only a big\nindicator of a fake friend,\nbut it's a sign someone is capable of\nand likely to betray you.\nEn garde.\nNumber six, they tell many small lies.\nHave you ever caught\nsomeone in a white lie?\nUh-oh. Pants on fire.\nWhile it may not seem like a big deal,\ntelling small lies is a stepping stone\nto telling larger and more important lies.\nIf someone is lying about minor things\nlike where they got something\nor who they talk to,\nthey may have the capability\nto lie about bigger things.\nA genuine person wouldn't\nlie even about small things\nbecause trust and communication\nare key factors in any relationship.\nNumber seven, they dodge your questions.\nHas anyone ever answered your questions\nwith \"fine\" or another question?\nMuch like telling small lies,\nit may not seem like a huge issue,\nbut it's a big sign\nthey're not trustworthy\nand have something to hide.\nAvoiding your questions generally means\nsomeone is preparing to or\nalready has betrayed you.\nNumber eight, they conceal\ntheir phone from you.\nOkay, picture this.\nYou're with someone who's\nconstantly on their phone.\nBut the second you glance over\nto see what they're looking at,\nthey flip their phone down\nand pull it away from you.\nIf they're hiding their phone from you,\nthey probably have a reason why.\nIt's a secretive and distrusting habit,\nmeaning it's probably a good sign\nthey'll betray you and your\ntrust and your confidence.\nAnd number nine,\nthey change account\npasswords that you know.\nTalk about foreshadowing.\nHas anyone ever removed your fingerprint\nfrom their phone without telling you?\nIt's a big indicator\nthey no longer trust you\nand are pulling away from you.\nThere's also probably a reason why\nthey don't want you to have\naccess to their accounts anymore,\nwhich hints that there's\nsomething they're hiding.\nIf someone you know\nhas recently begun to\nhide their information,\nthey could be preparing to betray you.\nThe most important thing\nto remember about betrayal\nis that it isn't your fault.\nYou can't control how others act.\nSo all you can do is try to avoid\nsuch people who betray others.\nIt can take months or\neven years to get over,\nbut with a little timely vigilance\nyou can help protect yourself\nfrom its lethal clutches.\nKeeping an eye out for these signs\ncan surely help you spot\nbetrayal coming from a mile away\nand take measures to tackle it.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto some of the telltale signs\nof impending betrayal\ncreeping towards you.\nDo you think these nine\nsigns will help you do that?\nHave you ever encountered\nthese in real life?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters\nwith them, if you'd like.\nPlease feel free to share any\nthoughts you have as well.\nWould you like a video on how to tackle\nimminent betrayal beforehand?\nDo let us know down below.\nIf you found this video interesting,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with others out there\nwith betrayal looming on the horizon.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nAnd thanks for watching.\nWe'll see you in our next video."
