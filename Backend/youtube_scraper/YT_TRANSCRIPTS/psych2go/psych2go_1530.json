    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nThank you so much for all the\nsupport that you've given us.\n\"Psych2Go's\" mission is to help everyone\nlearn more about psychology\nin a digestible way,\nand you help us do that.\nSo, thanks again.\nNow, back to the video.\nHave you ever wondered,\nwhat makes you or other people attractive?\nDo you believe that attraction\nis purely based on physical attributes?\nMaybe you think it has\nto do with your height,\nthe color of your eyes, or\nhow sharp your jawline is,\nbut attraction is actually much deeper\nthan just your physical characteristics.\nInstead, other attributes and habits\ncan play a part in how attractive you are.\nYour personality,\nmannerisms, talking habits\nand body language can affect\nhow much others are attracted to you.\nSo here are 10 surprising habits\nwhich may make you more attractive.\nBefore we begin, we would like to mention\nthat this video is for\neducational purposes only,\nand not designed to suggest\nthat only these traits\nare considered attractive.\nEverybody is different,\nand experiences attraction differently.\nNumber one, you're\ncurious about everything.\nDo you enjoy learning\nabout how things work?\nDo you often ask yourself why\npeople behave the way they do?\nBeing curious about the world\nand having a willingness to\nlearn about how things work\nshows others that you're\nopen to new opportunities\nand experiences, which\nis an attractive trait.\nNumber two, you make time for yourself.\nDo you dedicate time to pursue\nthe things that make you happy?\nPeople who are constantly busy\ndoing things they genuinely enjoy,\nusually end up becoming more successful\nthan those who treat their\ntime as if it's worth nothing.\nThis may be because,\nhaving your own goals,\npassions and dreams,\nthat are separate from\nanyone and anything else\nshows that you're motivated\nand aware of your own abilities\nand not dependent on others.\nNumber three, open body\nlanguage and mirroring.\nDo you always look away or cross your arms\nwhen you're talking with others?\nThis type of closed body\nlanguage can be off-putting,\ninstead, direct eye\ncontact, open body language,\nand the ability to engage\nand connect with others\ncan all help to increase\nperceived attractiveness.\nAlso, according to a study\ndone in the Netherlands,\nimitating and mimicking someone's movement\ncan actually foster\nfeelings of connectedness,\nwhich make you seem more attractive.\nNumber four, you live in the moment.\nAre you always aware and\npresent in the moment?\nAccording to a study on attractiveness\nduring a speed dating situation,\nwomen found men to be more attractive\nif they measured higher in mindfulness.\nNumber five, you connect\ndeeply with people.\nHave you ever heard the phrase,\n\"Birds of a feather flock together?\"\nAccording to Power of Positivity,\nwe're attracted to people similar to us.\nYou may have noticed this most at school.\nWhen those with similar\ninterests and hobbies\nspend most of their time together.\nThe more you connect deeply with others,\nthe more likable attractive you become.\nNumber six, you look for\nthrill-seeking adventures.\nDo you purposefully look for activities\nthat would make your blood rush?\nAccording to a study,\nin the journal \"Archives\nof Sexual Behavior,\"\nsingle people who went for\na ride on a roller coaster\nrated members of the opposite\nsex as more attractive.\nSo you may wanna take your\ndate on a rollercoaster\nthe next time you see them.\nNumber seven, you exercise\nand have a healthy body.\nAnd it comes as no surprise,\nthat your physique plays a part\nin how others may be attracted to you.\nWhile not everybody should be aiming\nto look like a supermodel\nor be the next big boxing champion,\nboth men and women do tend to\nlook out for healthy partners.\nThis attraction to healthy bodies,\nmaybe because healthy partners\nbring about a higher chance\nof success at raising healthy children.\nNumber eight, you say thank you.\nDo you thank people when they help you?\nPerhaps someone held the door open for you\non your way to work,\nor maybe it's the waitress\nthat was serving you at lunch.\nSaying thank you, is a sign\nof gratitude and politeness.\nNot only does it show others\nthat you appreciate their effort,\nbut it also tells others that\nyou're kind and thoughtful,\nwhich is an attractive trait.\nNumber nine, you forgive and\nlearn from your mistakes.\nAre you the type to keep\nmaking the same mistakes\nover and over again,\nor do you learn from\nthem and go from there?\nDemonstrating self-kindness\nby forgiving yourself for making mistakes\nshows that you're working\ntowards improving yourself.\nStudies have shown that\npsychological traits\nare important in human mating.\nWith both sexes,\nvaluing intelligence and\nkindness, very highly.\nAnd number 10, you know your worth.\nDo you depend on other people\nto validate your worth?\nBeing confident in the fact\nthat you are intrinsically\nvaluable as a human being and more so,\nbecause of your character, intelligence\nand kind actions, is attractive.\nSelf-love is the best way\nto build self-confidence\nand there is nothing wrong with thinking,\n\"I would make a great\ncatch for the partner\nwho is worthy of me.\"\nAs long as you aim for an attitude\nof gentle, self-assurance,\nthat doesn't cross a line into arrogance.\nHave you done any of\nthe things we've listed?\nLet us know
