    "transcript": "- Hey, psych2goers.\nThank you so much for your support!\nHow do the people around\nyou make you feel?\nAre you truly happy in life right now?\nHaving a loving and caring family,\npartner, and friends is important\nto keep you happy and fulfilled in life.\nHowever, like anything in life,\nit's impossible to have\nonly the good things\nwithout experiencing the bad things,\nand having bad and toxic friends\nhas always been a very common occurrence.\nToxic relationships can be very damaging\nfor your overall wellbeing.\nSo it's very important\nto cut the toxic relationships off\nas soon as possible.\nWith this in mind, here\nare five types of people\nyou should stop being friends with.\nOne, the friend who\nalways needs something.\nDoes your friend only ever talk to you\nwhen he or she needs something?\nThis is a very telling sign\nthat you have a toxic\nrelationship with that person.\nDon't get this wrong.\nIt's okay to need things from your friends\nfrom time to time.\nBut a friend, who is constantly asking\nfor things from you,\nbe it money, class notes, or a ride\nwithout giving anything back,\nis certainly someone\nwho will not contribute\nto your happiness.\nTrue friendships involve mutual interest\nand not one person just\ntaking from the other.\nAdditionally, people tend to change\ntheir relationship priorities\nat different times in their lives.\nAnd it's normal for your friends\nto have less time for you\nwhen they start working\non a personal project\nor when they find a partner.\nWhat's not okay is only looking for you\nwhen they need something\nand then giving you zero priority\nand disappearing once\nthey get what they want.\nThat only shows that rather\nthan being interested in you,\nthey only see you as someone\nwho they can take from.\nSo, cutting these people out of your life\nwill allow you to spend\nmore time and effort\non people who are actually interested.\nTwo, the friend who gaslights you.\nHave you ever had a friend\nwho constantly blames you\nwhenever something bad\nhappens in the relationship?\nIf the answer is yes,\nyou might need to consider\nthat your friend is gaslighting you.\nGaslighting refers to the act\nof manipulating a person\nto question their thoughts,\nmemories, and things\nhappening around them.\nMake sure that you compare\nwhat your friend is saying\nwith the way they act.\nFor example, if your friend says\nthat they care for you after blaming you,\nbut treats you very badly,\nchances are that they are only saying\nthat they care for you\nas a way to gaslight you.\nThree, the friend who\nnever reaches out to you.\nDo you feel like you are the one\ndoing everything in a\nfriendship to maintain it?\nAre you always the one\nwho has to make the plans\nto meet with your friend?\nA very common trait of a toxic friendship\nis a one-sided investment\nof time and effort.\nIf and when they decide\nto answer your texts,\nthey also make you feel\nlike they are doing you a favor.\nIf you can relate to that situation,\nthen it might be a good idea\nto find a way out of the relationship.\nBeing in a friendship where\nyou have to do everything\nand then they make you feel\nlike they're doing you a favor\ncan be very exhausting\nand make you feel underappreciated.\nFour, the friend who always\ntalks about themselves.\nKeeping a balance in relationships\ncan be considered impossible,\nso accepting that some\nthings will be unfair\nin friendships is very common.\nHowever, do you feel\nlike your conversations\nwith your friend always\nend up being about them?\nEven when you talk to them about a problem\nthat you're having, they turn it around\nso that the conversation\nends up being about them.\nYou might be looking for someone\nwhom you can vent your problems to\nonly to find yourself being the one\nlistening to your friend's problem.\nHaving this kind of friend\ncan be frustrating\nsince you will feel like\nyou cannot rely on them\nor tell them anything\nwhile you always have to give them\nyour time and attention.\nFive, the friend who\nalways talks down on you.\nDo you feel like your friend\nconstantly says things\nto put you down or make you feel inferior?\nIf the answer is yes,\nthen the best you can do\nis stop being friends with that person.\nIt's normal to feel like\nyou are not in a place\nthat you wish to be\nwhen one of your friends gets a promotion\nor has achieved something you have not.\nAfter all, this feeling\nis one of the main driving\nforces for success.\nHowever, it's completely different\nif your friend is the one who comes to you\nand brags about the promotion\nwith the intent of making you feel\nlike you are inferior.\nYou are better off with no friends\nthan with friends who enjoy\nmaking you feel inferior constantly.\nIf any of the situations addressed above\nsound familiar to you, then reevaluating\nwho you should truly consider a friend\nand reorganizing your priorities\nis the way to go.\nAfter all, you wouldn't\nwant to be investing\nmost of your time and effort\ninto nourishing a toxic friendship\nthat will only negatively affect\nyour overall wellbeing.\nWe hope we were able to give you insight\ninto how some people are\njust not your friends at all.\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nHow did you find out?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters\nwith them if you'd like.\nPlease feel free to share any thoughts\nyou have as well.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share with those
