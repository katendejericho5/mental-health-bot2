    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nhave you ever been on a first date\nwhere you ran out of topics to discuss\nand it made the rest of the date awkward\nand you noticed your date being distant,\nor maybe you had an awkward,\nfidgety conversation with your crush?\nIf so, you're probably wondering\nhow to turn this awkward\nsituation into attraction.\nHere are five ways.\nNumber one, mirroring their actions.\nHave you ever found yourself\nor others imitating the actions\nof their company?\nThis could be a sign\nthat the imitator shows\na liking towards them.\nStudies have shown\nthat subtly imitating\nanother person's actions\nand behaviors helps to create social bonds\nand maybe even romantic ones.\nPeople tend to find their\npartners more attractive\nif the other mimics their own\nverbal or nonverbal behavior.\nFor example, sipping a glass of water,\nor leaning against the wall\nwhen your partner does it.\nSo the next time you get stuck\nin an awkward conversation,\nsubtly mirroring your partner's actions\ncould help release tension\nand make you feel more\ncomfortable with each other.\nNumber two, engage in eye contact.\nIn romantic movies,\ncouples are usually portrayed\ngazing into each other's eyes.\nThis is no different than in real life.\nOccasional eye contact\nbetween two individuals\nhas been known to bring\npeople closer together.\nSo when you feel like a\nconversation is going nowhere,\ngaze into your partner's eyes occasionally\nto show them you are\ninterested and attentive.\nWho knows, it could be the start\nof a long lasting romantic relationship.\nNumber three, use open body language.\nOften, body language can\ntell a lot about a person\nand affect how the other\nperson behaves in your company.\nClosed body language,\nlike crossing your arms,\nmay give off a feeling that\nyou're mentally closed off,\nmaking conversations\ndifficult and awkward.\nThis could lead your partner to think\nthat you're not interested in them.\nKeeping your abdomen, torso,\nor chest open are examples\nof open body language\nthat can increase your attractiveness,\nas it portrays availability\nand confidence,\nthus making others more comfortable\nand trusting around you.\nNumber four, laugh off the situation.\nHave you ever made an awkward comment\nthat made the atmosphere\nheavy or uncomfortable?\nIf so, joking and laughing off the remark\ncan help turn the situation around,\nbecause humor is a highly\nvalued quality in others.\nIn fact,\nsuch humor could be\nconsidered a powerful tool\nto overcome dissimilarities\nand attitudes between two individuals.\nHumor helps to maintain a relationship,\ndespite differences of opinion\nthat may make things tense.\nIt also creates a loving\nbond between both individuals\nand increased attraction\ntowards each other.\nRemember, the use of jokes\nis no laughing matter.\nNumber five, apologize and\nmake amends when necessary.\nHave you ever made a mistake\naround your partner or crash?\nMaybe you were late to meet up,\nor some other small mistake.\nIt can make situations awkward,\nas such behavior could\nbe viewed negatively,\nbut apologizing when needed\ndemonstrates accountability\nand responsibility,\nboth of which are important traits\nwhen it comes to romantic relationships.\nThis gives your partner a\nsense of trust and assurance,\nmaking you seem more\nattractive in the process.\nSo did these five methods help you out?\nRemember that awkwardness\nis bound to happen\nthroughout your life.\nWe're all human after all,\nand we're not perfect.\nTake it in stride, laugh it off,\nor find some other method\nthat works for you.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find some good\nadvice in this video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching, and\nwe'll see you next time.\n(gentle music)"
