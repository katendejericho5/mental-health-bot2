    "transcript": "- [Tutor] Hey psych2Goers,\nwhat do you think makes\na person attractive?\nPerhaps it's their physical\nappearance or the way they talk,\nmaybe it's how popular\nthey are on social media\nor how talented they could be.\nThere are tons of different\nopinions and factors\nthat may play a part,\nbut one common quality\nthat can make you instantly attractive\nis being a good human being.\nSo while you may think it's impossible\nto make yourself more appealing\nto others, think again.\nHere are seven daily habits\nof highly attractive people.\nNumber one, maintaining\na positive mindset.\nDo you let little mishaps\nthrough in your whole day?\nInstead of focusing on the negative,\nhighly attractive people tend to focus\non the brighter side of things.\nBecause of this attitude,\nthey can usually turn serious\nor pressuring events into humorous ones.\nLightening the overall mood\nand cracking jokes to make everyone laugh\ntriggers the release of endorphins,\nthe body's natural feel-good chemicals,\nwhich can make everyone\naround them feel good as well.\nSo the next time you trip over\nor spill some mustard on your shirt,\nit may help to not dwell on it too much.\nDust yourself off, move on\nand have a laugh about it.\nNumber two, constantly\nchecking up on their friends.\nHow do you treat the people around you?\nPeople are attractive when\nthey're caring and thoughtful,\nand you can see this in how\nthey treat their friends.\nWhen people see how well you\ntreat the people around you,\nthey'll want to be treated that way too.\nYou can try this by identifying\nthe people in your life\nwho you cherish and value,\nlisten to them and make them feel heard.\nNumber three, practicing self-care.\nDo you find their fashion sense charming?\nAside from their personality,\nattractive people practice\nhygiene and self care.\nThey appreciate themselves\nand don't hesitate\nin providing their body\nthe pampering it deserves,\nwhich may mean following\na skincare routine,\nexercising every other day,\nor following a healthy sleeping schedule.\nYou should keep in mind\nthat it doesn't mean that\nthese people are robots\nwho stick to rigid self care techniques\nevery second of the day,\nthey just know what they need\nand when they need to take it.\nSo what self care habit do\nyou find yourself lacking?\nNumber four, not caring what others think.\nAre you always worried about\nwhat other people think?\nAnother habit that can\nmake you highly attractive\nis to be unapologetically yourself,\nbecause highly attractive\npeople understand\nthat it's impossible to\nmake everyone like them.\nThey won't shy away\nfrom being who they are\nand doing what they want to do.\nIn the end haters will hate,\nso don't be afraid to grab\nyour risky or eccentric outfits\nor do whatever it is\nthat you're afraid of.\nNumber five, keeping an open mind.\nHow do you handle disagreements?\nBeing able to continue a\ncalm, insightful discussion\nwith the person you disagree with\nis an attractive trait because\nit shows your maturity.\nEveryone comes from a different\nbackground and upbringing\nand will have their own opinions.\nSo conflict is bound happen,\nbut instead of insisting\nthat you are right,\nthe more attractive\nthing to do is to listen\nand to put yourself in their shoes.\nWhy do you think they reached that opinion\nin the first place?\nWould you share their mindset\nif you were living their life?\nKeep this up and you may\nfind that a lot more people\nwanna spend time with you.\nNumber six, taking some alone time.\nDo you know when you need a break?\nDoes this how attractive\npeople know when to socialize?\nThey also know when to\ntake time for themselves.\nWorking all day and talking\nwith others can be draining.\nSo when you've reached your limit,\ndon't be afraid to take some downtime.\nThis can help you relax,\ngather your thoughts and\nreflect on the things\nthat have transpired.\nAnd number seven, handling conflict well.\nAre you easily irritated during arguments?\nHighly attractive people\nknow when to admit\nand own up to their mistakes,\nespecially when it really is their fault.\nThey're not afraid to be the bigger person\nand try to understand the other\nparty as much as possible.\nOf course, this doesn't mean\ntaking the blame all the time,\nbut it's knowing that there are days\nwhere you have to take the high road\nto deal with the situation properly.\nPerhaps the other person is\njust having a really bad day,\nhowever, when the situation calls for it,\nthere's also nothing wrong\nwith standing up for yourself.\nWhat do you think makes\nsomeone attractive?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to
