Mogilski,\nand Marissa A. Harrison\nhad 40 participants,\n20 male and 20 female,\nmanipulate their voices.\nFor one part of the study,\nresearchers had participants\nattempt to sound attractive.\nThe study states that \"Among them,\n\"we found that when trying\nto sound sexy or attractive,\n\"both sexes slowed their speech\n\"and women lowered their pitch,\n\"and had a greater vocal hoarseness.\"\nThe results?\nWhen subjects manipulated their\nvoice to sound attractive,\nresearchers found women were\nable to alter their voices\nto sound more attractive,\nsimply counting from one to 10.\nMen on the other hand were rated\nas sounding less attractive\nwhen they throw on their sexy voice.\nNumber three.\nCuddling after sex can\nincrease satisfaction.\nWho doesn't love cuddles?\nBut apparently, cuddling after\nsex is the time to do it.\nA 2014 study,\npublished in the Archives\nof Sexual Behavior\nfound that cuddling, kissing,\nand affectionate talking after intercourse\ncan increase a couple's bond\nand sexual satisfaction.\nWhen researchers asked partners\nto cuddle more after sex,\ncouples who did so\nreported greater levels of\nrelationship satisfaction\nand sexual satisfaction.\nThey found this notably more true\nfor those couples with children.\nResearcher, Amy Muise notes that\n\"When people think of sex,\n\"they tend to be focused\non intercourse and orgasm.\"\nThis research suggests\nthat other affectionate aspects of sex\nare important for sexual and\nrelationship satisfaction.\nNumber four.\nNot everyone desires sex.\nAs you may know, not everyone desires sex.\nThis is especially normal\nfor those who are asexual.\nAsexuality is a sexual orientation\nwhere someone doesn't\nexperience sexual attraction\ntowards others,\nor they may experience little\ndesire for sexual encounters.\nEveryone is different, so\nit's seen more on a spectrum.\nWhen it comes to sexual desire,\nyour normal may be different from others.\nSex therapist, and New York\nTimes bestselling author,\nIan Kerner said it best, explaining that\n\"Normal, such an elastic word,\n\"it depends on what your\nbaseline libido is.\"\nNumber five.\nSex before a stressful task\nmay lower your level of stress.\nGot a big test tomorrow?\nWell, let's look at the research.\nA 2006 research study,\npublished in the journal,\nBiological Psychology\nhad subjects take part\nin stressful activities.\nThese included giving a public speech\nor taking a difficult math quiz.\nSubjects who had sex before the test\nhad lower blood pressure\nand lower levels of stress.\nThis was when compared\nto those who had no sex,\nthose who masturbated,\nand those who had sexual\ncontact without intercourse.\nThe study even claims that\npenile-vaginal intercourse, PVI,\nbut not other sexual\nbehavior is associated with\nbetter psychological and\nphysiological function.\nAnd number six, sex can\nalter your pain perception.\nAccording to some research,\nsex may alter your pain perception,\nmaking you feel less pain.\nThe section of the brain\ncalled the hypothalamus\nreleases the feel-good hormone, oxytocin,\nalso known as the love hormone\nduring orgasm or arousal.\nResearchers at Rutgers University\nfound that this release of oxytocin\nmay help women feel less pain.\nThis can be especially\ntrue during menstruation.\nAnother study, published\nin the Bulletin of Experimental\nBiology and Medicine\nfound that extremely low doses of oxytocin\nreduce pain sensitivity in men,\nlowering one's pain threshold by 56.5%.\nWowza!\nSo, which of these facts\nwere you more surprised to learn about?\nDid you watch our other video\non psychological facts about sex?\nWhich facts are more interesting to you?\nFeel free to let us know in\nthe comment section down below.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video\nand learned something new,\nand if you did, don't forget\nto click the like button\nand share this video with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks\nso much for watching."
