They feel\nhelpless and hopeless.\nDoes someone you know seem bummed out,\nbut it's been an ongoing feeling\nfor longer than two weeks?\nDo they have a bleak, gray\noutlook on their life?\nPeople who are depressed,\nstruggle with despair,\nand they have a difficult\ntime feeling optimistic\nbecause their emotional\nresponse to things good or bad\ncan be difficult to express.\nNumber two. They've lost\ninterest and pleasure\nin their daily activities.\nDo they find the activities\nthat they used to enjoy\nsuddenly pointless?\nHave they neglected their\nhobbies or personal hygiene?\nWhen asked about their withdrawal,\ndo they reply with, what's the point\nor why should I try?\nDepression makes people lose their ability\nto feel pleasure and joy.\nNumber three.\nThey have feelings of\nself-loathing and worthlessness.\nSufferers of depression develop inaccurate\nand harsh self-criticisms\nbecause they zoom in on\ntheir mistakes and flaws.\nThis leads to them feeling\nguilty about past actions\nand events and even guilty\nfor having depression itself.\nThis results in low self-esteem\nand feeling worthless,\nand the cycle starts up again.\nNumber four. They have\nunexplained aches and pains.\nDepression not only affects our minds,\nbut our bodies as well.\nDoes someone you know\nhave persistent body pains\nthat they can't shake off,\neven with medication?\nThese symptoms can be psychosomatic,\nwhich refers to real physical\nsymptoms that arise from\nor are influenced by the mind and emotions\nrather than a specific cause in the body.\nAccording to doctors,\nNancy Schimmel Funing and Stephen Gans,\nsome examples of physical\nsymptoms are headaches,\nstomach pain, back pain,\nstiff joints, and aching muscles.\nNumber five. They feel fatigued and slow.\nHas this person complained\nabout feeling drained\nand sluggish and those\nfeelings don't go away,\neven though they get enough sleep?\nDo they take naps daily even with sleep?\nAnother physical symptom\nof depression is fatigue\nand decreased energy\nbecause of the mental exhaustion\nthat comes with depression.\nNumber six. They have memory issues.\nDo they feel like they\ncan't think straight\nand are forgetting important\ntasks and appointments?\nDepression can cause problems\nwith making decisions\nand remembering things.\nBrain fog is another annoying symptom\nbecause as depression increases,\nthe ability to focus decreases.\nNumber seven. They develop\nchanges in their sleep habits.\nDo they sleep less than normal\nor has the standard hours of quality sleep\nrequired for their age changed?\nOr have they developed insomnia\nor don't sleep well at night?\nPerhaps they have hypersomnia\nmeaning they sleep more than they used to.\nHowever, this manifests,\nit becomes hard for them\nto keep up with daily tasks\nand this lack in quality\nsleep can lead to anxiety.\nAccording to a University\nof Pennsylvania study,\nit was discovered that\nsubjects who were limited\nto only 4.5 hours of\nsleep a night for one week\nreported feeling more stressed, angry,\nsad, and mentally exhausted.\nNumber eight.\nThey have a change in\ntheir appetite and weight.\nDoes this person seem to\nhave lost their appetite\nor gained a heartier one,\nor do they seem as if\nthey've lost or gained weight\nwithout even trying?\nApparently this change in appetite\ncan happen quite quickly\nover the course of a month\nwith a 5% change,\naccording to healthguide.org.\nEdward Abramson, PhD, Emeritus professor\nat California State\nUniversity at Chico states,\n\"When you're depressed,\nit's much harder to get out of bed,\nmuch less pay attention\nto what you're eating.\"\nNumber nine. They're irritable\nand have mood swings.\nHas this person become restless\nand easily upset by small things?\nDo they say that people are\ngetting on their nerves?\nAs a result of depression,\nthey have an internal imbalance.\nSo they have uncontrollable\nemotions that fluctuate,\nfor example, from happy and calm,\nto angry and upset.\nThey have a low tolerance\nfor people's behaviors.\nSo they lash out unexpectedly,\ncreating more guilt and\ntension within themselves,\nand therefore their relationships.\nAnd number 10, they obsessively talk\nand think about death.\nPeople with depression,\nunfortunately deal with suicidal thoughts\nthat become frequent and\ncan sometimes be acted upon.\nThis internal black cloud\nmakes it nearly impossible\nto look forward to anything at all.\nThey might say things like,\nno one would miss me if I was gone,\nor everyone would be\nbetter off without me.\nIf anyone feels like\nacting on these impulses,\nplease find help by calling\nyour national suicide hotlines\nor contacting a medical professional,\nor sharing with a trusted friend.\nWe've added list of suicide hotlines\nin the description below.\nDo you or someone you know\nrelate to these signs?\nIf you found anything helpful,\nplease share this video\nwith anyone you think it could benefit.\nDo you have any other warning\nsigns that you know of?\nPlease feel free to share\nin the comments below.\nAs always the references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks for watching,\nand we'll see you next."
