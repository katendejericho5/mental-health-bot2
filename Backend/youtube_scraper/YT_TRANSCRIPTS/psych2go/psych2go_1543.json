You experience apathy.\nAre you experiencing a lack of interest\nin things you used to enjoy?\nApathy is a persistent lack of passion.\nIt can cause you to feel disinterested\nin meeting new people\nor trying new things,\nbut it can also instill indifference\ntowards things you enjoy.\nExternally, you may not\nexhibit many emotions\nor the opposite may be true.\nTo make others worry less or avoid stigma,\nyou may feel pressured\nto be more expressive.\nHowever, in the long run,\napathy can put a strain on\nyour personal relationships\nand performance.\nNumber two. You experience dissociation.\nAnother sign of a declining\nmental state is dissociation.\nDissociation takes on many forms,\nsuch as derealization, depersonalization\nand dissociative amnesia.\nDerealization or\ndepersonalization often feels\nlike you're having an\nout of body experience\nor a feeling of being unreal.\nThese as well as other\nforms of dissociation\noccur because of severe stress.\nIt's your body's way of coping\nwith a distressing event\nor emotion.\nPlease consult an adult professional\nif you're experiencing\nany forms of dissociation.\nNumber three. You withdraw\nfrom your friends and family.\nSocial withdrawal can\nalso be a sign of change\nin your mental state.\nOf course, you're not obligated\nto attend social events.\nIt's okay to stay in if you need a break,\nso this sign is a bit subjective.\nIf you don't usually go out,\nsocial withdrawal may just\nbe your usual behavior.\nA more sure sign is if you\nactively avoid meeting family\nor friends, because you no\nlonger feel like seeing them.\nThough social withdrawal\ndoes not seem like such an ominous sign,\nit can put a strain on your\npotential relationships.\nNumber four. You experience mood changes.\nOne of the most common signs\nthat you might be experiencing\nmental health instability\nis mood swings.\nThere will be moments when your emotions\nmight get the best of you,\nbut usually you can regroup\nand regulate your emotions after a bit.\nHowever, if your emotional\nstate is worsening,\nyou may find it difficult to recover.\nYou may feel more sensitive,\nirritable, or critical.\nAlthough your emotional and mental state\nare not the only things\nthat affect your mood,\npersistent and drastic changes\ncan point to emotional dysregulation.\nEmotional dysregulation\ncan cause more stress,\ntrouble sleeping, strain\nyour personal relationships\nand worsen depression.\nAnd number five,\nyou've developed unhealthy behaviors.\nHave you developed\nunhealthy coping mechanisms\nto numb your emotional stress?\nFor example, frequently skipping meals\nor engaging in self harm.\nMental strain or distress\ncan cause you to behave differently\nor out of character.\nIt can cause us to be more agitated,\nengage in risky activities\nor behave radically.\nIf you relate to any of these signs,\nthe best resource is a therapist.\nWe highly encourage you\nto reach out to them\nif you ever need help.\nSo do you relate to any of these signs?\nWe hope this video helps reduce the stigma\ntowards mental illnesses and issues,\nand brought more awareness to them.\nPlease seek out a mental\nhealth professional\nif you're struggling.\nLike and share this video with friends\nthat might find some good\nadvice in this video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to like Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell\nfor more new content.\nAll the references used\nare added in the description box below.\nThank you so much for watching.\nAnd we'll see you next time."
