    "transcript": "- [Narrator] It is often said\nthat we are made of the largest\nthings that happen to us,\nthe events that shake us.\nThis is only partially true.\nThe things that constitute us the most\nare those that we repeat\neach and every single day.\nThere's beauty in the everyday\naffairs of human existence.\nWe have not only come\nto identify the necessity\nof work and play,\nbut to enjoy, conquer, and excel in it,\nto make it our own,\nto enjoy the warmth of\nthe sun on your skin\nas you tend to a garden,\nthe gratification that\ncomes from cleaning a room,\ncooking a meal,\nperhaps even from simply\nallowing yourself a break.\nGratitude dances delicately on our lips\nas we indulge at the\ntable of the every day.\nLet us take care to savor its taste,\nto not let it wash away through\nthe frantic passage of time.\nAfter all, that's the life\nwe choose to live every day.\n(gentle music)"
