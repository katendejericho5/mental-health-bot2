    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another brand new video.\nWhy does it seem like you\nspend most of your time in bed,\nlying down and not doing much lately?\nAre you someone who easily gets tired\nand doesn't feel like doing anything?\nDo you label this kind of\nbehavior as mere laziness\nand nothing more?\nThere's actually a lot of overlap\nbetween laziness and burnout\nthat can make it difficult\nto differentiate between the two.\nBurnout is a negative state\nof emotional, physical,\nand mental exhaustion\ncaused by excessive stress\nand inability to cope with it.\nAnd as of 2010,\na survey reported that\napproximately 75% of adults\nin the United States alone\nhave experienced symptoms of burnout\nwith over 40% of cases being more severe.\nNow, more than ever,\nit's become imperative to educate\nand better understand\nthe nature of burnout.\nSo with that said, here\nare six tell-tale signs\nthat what you're experiencing right now\nisn't actually laziness but burnout.\nNumber one, you feel\ndisconnected from everything.\nAre you going through\nthe motions of every day\nas if on autopilot?\nIs there a persistent\nfeeling of being detached\nfrom your own self?\nIf you're suffering from burnout,\none of the things you\nmight be experiencing,\nbut don't quite realize or\nunderstand is depersonalization.\nPeople experiencing depersonalization,\nmost commonly those\nstruggling with trauma,\nreport feeling a strange\nsort of emotional numbness\nor emptiness as if they were watching life\nfrom outside of themselves.\nThey don't feel like themselves anymore,\nthey don't feel engaged by anything,\nand they constantly struggle\nwith the overwhelming\nsense of helplessness\nand inability to take back\ncontrol of their lives.\nNumber two, you used to be motivated.\nLaziness is a character trait.\nAnd character traits tend\nto remain stable over time.\nA lazy person doesn't ever\nfeel like exerting effort\nor applying themselves to things.\nBut if you used to be\nself-motivated and high achieving,\noften excelling in certain areas,\nand have only recently\nbecome exhausted, apathetic,\nand unmotivated,\nthen it's more likely that\nyou're suffering from burnout\nand not laziness like\nmost people would think.\nNumber three, you used to be passionate.\nA clear difference between\nsomeone who's burnt out\nand someone who's lazy\nis that the former used\nto have things they were passionate about,\nbut may now be struggling to find interest\nor enjoyment in anymore.\nWhether it's a talent, a\nsport, or just your academic\nor professional performance in general,\nburnout can make it hard for you\nto do the things you once\nloved or felt passionate about.\nYou might even come to hate or resent it\nbecause of how much\nyou overworked yourself\nand pushed yourself to\nthe brink because of it.\nOuch!\nNumber four, you've become\nmoody and irritable.\nDo you suddenly find yourself\nsnappy and easily irritated?\nDo you often feel emotionally\nout of control nowadays\nand don't know why?\nMoodiness and irritability are common,\nbut often overlooked signs of burnout.\nSo if you start to have trouble\ncontrolling your emotions,\nespecially when it never\nused to be a problem for you,\nthis might be the reason why.\nLazy people, on the other hand,\nare a stark contrast to this\nbecause they're often very\nrelaxed, laid back, placid,\nand unaffected by things.\nNumber five, you've\nneglected your self-care.\nOne of the most distressing warning signs\nthat someone may be emotionally\nand physically burnt out\nis if you start neglecting your self-care\nand socially withdraw from others.\nThere are concerning\nchanges in your eating\nand/or sleeping patterns.\nYou stop making an effort to\ngroom yourself or look good,\nand you tend to spend most of your time\nby yourself doing nothing\nbecause you're so easily exhausted\nby even the simplest of tasks.\nThe difference between\nbeing burnt out and laziness\nare starkly in the fact that\nyou weren't always this way.\nAnd number six, these\nchanges happened gradually.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\nsomething you should know about burnout\nis that it develops in stages.\nSo all of the points mentioned before:\nlosing interest and motivation,\nespecially in things we used to love,\nfeeling detached from\nyourself and disconnected\nfrom everything around you,\nsocially withdrawing, and\nneglecting your self-care,\nwon't just happen overnight.\nStudies show\nthat there are actually five\nmajor stages of burnout,\neach with increasing degrees of severity:\nThe honeymoon phase, the onset\nof stress, chronic stress,\nburnout, and habitual burnout.\nMany people begin to experience symptoms\nas early as the second phase,\nwhen there is still a\nmoderate amount of stress,\nbut optimism, interest, motivation,\nand performance may\nalready start declining.\nAnd by the time you reached\nthe fifth and final stage,\nburnout has already become\nso embedded in your life\nthat the persistent mental\nand physical fatigue\nbecome more intense and harder to treat,\nmaking you more vulnerable\nto developing depression and anxiety.\nSpotting the signs of burnout early\nmakes it all the more\neasier for you to get help\nand recover from it.\nThat's why it's so important\nto raise awareness about burnout,\ninstead of simply\ndismissing it as laziness\nlike most people tend to do.\nSo if you or anyone you\nknow may be suffering\nfrom mental or emotional burnout,\nplease don't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental healthcare professional today\nand talk to them about it.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the Like button.\nFeel free to
