back\nto another brand new video.\nHave you ever wandered about thoughts?\nDo you control your thoughts\nor are you controlled by them?\nWhen do they become distortions?\nIf you compare your\nconscious mind to a film,\nthen your thoughts are the\none second still of a frame.\nLike films and any photographic medium,\nthoughts are subject to manipulation.\nWhen we consciously feed\nor engage with thoughts\nin a certain way, they gain power.\nThis is what differentiates a thought\nfrom a cognitive distortion.\nCognitive distortions are not thoughts.\nThere are ways of thinking\nwe actively engage in.\nSometimes annoyingly.\nPersistent cognitive\ndistortions can worsen\nor create mental health issues.\nFortunately, distorted thoughts are habits\nand we can learn to change them\nultimately preventing\nthese unhealthy habits\nfrom promoting unhealthy thinking styles.\nHere are five common habits\nthat distort how you think.\nOne, over-generalization.\nAfter a failed past relationship,\ndeleting dating apps or a\nskewing relationships altogether\nis the standard course of action.\nOvergeneralization is\na cognitive distortion\nwhere you might base all your information\non a single incident.\nThis kind of thinking is\nlimiting and sets you up\nfor all distorted thinking\nand emotional pain.\nIt establishes self defeat\nbefore even going to battle.\nMost times over\ngeneralizations are inaccurate.\nYour mind is like a soundboard.\nThe ideas you play over in your head\neventually make up the melody.\nIf you find yourself\novergeneralizing an action\nor event, pause.\nConsider doing a cost benefit\nanalysis on the thought.\nIs it worth thinking this way?\nAsk yourself if there is\nrelevant significant evidence\nto back up this thought.\nTwo, labeling.\nLabeling or mislabeling is an extreme form\nof overgeneralizing.\nAn example of labeling would\nbe when ignoring context,\nsomeone might label another as a jerk\nif they rubbed them the wrong way.\nIt's either globally self-directed\nor directed towards others.\nIn reality, labeling is just\nanother term for prejudice,\nharboring ill thoughts about someone,\nyou or someone else\nwithout sufficient evidence\nto support your thought.\nMislabeling typically\ninvolves highly colored\nand emotional language.\nOften you tend to label without context.\nA first step to combating these\nkinds of disordered thoughts\nis identifying them.\nThree, blaming.\nDo you constantly feel that in your life,\nthere are certain things\njust out of your control\nor that bad things happen\nregardless of how careful you are?\nHowever, this does not absolve\nyou from taking control\nof what you can control.\nA common habit that distorts\nthe way you think is blaming.\nAn example of Laming can look like this.\nStop making me feel bad about myself.\nYou may feel called out\nby someone's comment,\nbut like Eleanor Roosevelt said,\n\"no one can make you feel\ninferior without your consent.\"\nBlaming involves holding other people\nor situations accountable\nfor your emotional pain.\nIn some cases, it can\nalso go the other way,\nblaming yourself for\neverything that happens\neven when it is out of your control.\nThis thought habit encourages\nyou to not take responsibility\nor accountability for what happens to you.\nAlthough there will be things in your life\nthat you cannot control,\nhold yourself accountable\nfor the things you can,\nyour actions and emotions.\nFour, magnification.\nDo what ifs plague you into\nimagining the absolute worst\nin every situation?\nWhat if I do badly on this test?\nOr what if I get tongue\ntied at the interview?\nMagnification or catastrophizing\nis when you negatively\nexaggerate the outcome.\nYou are in a state of anxiety\nabout the negative possibilities,\nthus causing you to\nexaggerate the significance\nof unimportant events,\nsuch as a social blander\nor someone else's achievement.\nMagnification is harmful\nbecause it keeps you frozen,\ntoo scared to move forward.\nThe same can be said for\nmagnifications cousin,\nminimization.\nAn example of minimization\nis when you downplay\na personal achievement.\nI did score high on the\ntest, but I'm not that smart.\nFive, emotional reasoning.\nHave you ever thought back on a situation\nand wish you had reacted differently?\nIt is easy to let emotions\noverwhelm your rational mind\nand lead you to believe something\nthat is not necessarily true.\nEmotional reasoning is taking\nour emotions to the extreme,\nallowing our thoughts to be\nsolely ruled by our emotions.\nSome examples of emotional\nreasoning are, I feel guilty,\nso I must be guilty of something,\nor I feel inadequate, so I must be.\nEngaging in emotional\nreasoning means you've assumed\nthat these unhealthy\nemotions reflect reality.\nMental health issues\nmake emotional reasoning\none of the easiest\ndistortions to fall into.\nEmotions are like the\nweather, constantly changing.\nIf you are having a rainy day\nfinding shelter in someone\nwho is supportive and\nwilling to listen to you\ncan be a great help.\nGetting out of an emotional\nreasoning distortion\nmight not be easy, but reaching\nout to a licensed therapist\ncan help make a difference.\nCognitive distortions can\neasily change your perspective,\nby looking at the bright side,\nyou can easily change\nthe distortion as well.\nThat is because cognitive\ndistortions in essence are habits.\nAnd the most effective way\nto get rid of a bad habit\nis by replacing it with a healthier one.\nWhen faced with distortion,\nit helps to first identify it,\nexamine the evidence it\npresents and challenge it.\nYou will find that most of\nthese cognitive distortions\nfade away when you look at\nthem through a clearer lens.\nWhen having trouble dismantling\nsome of your thought habits,\nseeking a therapist for help\ncan help untangle the yarn ball\nof your thoughts.\nDid you find yourself nodding\nalong at these points?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your experiences with them\nif you'd like.\nPlease feel free to share any\nthoughts you have as well.\nIf you find this video
