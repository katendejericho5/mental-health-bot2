    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you feel that someone close to you\nhas internal struggles\nthat they fight every day?\nOr maybe that's you too.\nMany people bottle up their emotions\nand conceal their troubles\nall to themselves.\nHiding your depression\ncan be debilitating.\nIf prolonged, without necessary help,\nthese feelings can turn\ninto a state of despair\nand isolation that can be\ndifficult for them to escape.\nAre you or a loved one hiding depression?\nHere are some signs someone\nis hiding their depression.\nNumber one: They're\npessimistic about the future.\nDo they feel hopeless about their future?\nWhen you ask secretly-depressed\npeople about their plans,\nthey would either act\ndismissive, curt, or avoidant.\nBut in truth, these people often struggle\nto find meaning in their future\nand instead view it in a negative light.\nThey likely have thought hard about it,\nbut they always seem to end up\njust short of making sense of it.\nThese feelings stem from\na feeling of inadequacy\nand can cause mental anguish\nto both them and their close friends.\nNumber two: They have a\nhard time concentrating.\nDo you often lose their attention\nwhen you speak with them?\nAre they losing their train of thought\nduring conversations way too often?\nThis shows memory and\nconcentration issues,\na common symptom of depression.\nThis worsened memory state\nis even harder for them\nto have an honest chat with\ntheir friends and family.\nSince it's hard and draining\nfor them to articulate it,\nthey end up pushing their thoughts aside\nand further concealing their burdens,\nwhich doesn't solve any problems.\nIt helps when you can make\na safe space for your friend\nfor an honest conversation.\nBeing patient with\ntheir scattered thoughts\ngives them confidence that\nyou're there for them.\nNumber three: Their body\nundergoes big changes.\nDo they complain about pains\nand aches around their body\ndespite the absence of external injuries?\nWhile depression is primarily\na mental health issue,\nit can present itself in our bodies too.\nGaining or losing weight are\nsome signs of depression,\nas well as backaches, digestive problems,\nheadaches, and chronic conditions.\nResearch reports that people\nwith masked depression\nare more prone to common pain\nthan those who don't\nsuffer from the illness.\nSo, if they have unexplainable aches\nand are in a constant downcast mood,\ndepression might be\nsomething they're facing.\nNumber four: They get unusually quiet.\nDoes it feel like their energy\nhas been sapped for seemingly no reason?\nWhile it's normal to just\nhave nothing to say at times,\na pattern of long silences may be a sign\nof something stirring up underneath.\nWhile asking them whether they're fine\ncould temporarily bring\ntheir minds back to reality,\nthey'll eventually resort back\nto keeping everything to\nthemselves as a coping mechanism.\nThey may not feel sad, per se,\nbut instead feel a pervading\nfeeling of dread and emptiness,\ninternally asking themselves,\n\"What's the point?\"\nAlthough they try to appear normal\nand could successfully do so,\nenjoying a conversation with\nfriends still feels difficult.\nThey'd much rather retreat to\nthe solace of silence instead.\nNumber five: They keep\nconversations surface level.\nDoes it sometimes feel like\nthey have a brick wall put up?\nSecretly-depressed people can enjoy\nand have normal conversations,\nbut when you pry on their\ninnermost insecurities,\nthey can feel the burn of the pain again,\nwhich forces them to hole back up.\nFeelings of betrayal from\nthe past could resurface,\ntransporting them back to how bad it felt\nduring a time when they felt\nthe brunt of the impact.\nAlthough their composure doesn't waiver\nand they don't break down or lash out,\nthey'll stick with the\nsolace of safe topics\nbecause they know those\ntopics won't ever hurt them.\nAnd number six: They\nsmile to hide their pain.\nDo they tend to brush off their feelings\nand smile them away instead?\nWhat makes depression so sinister\nis the ease with which one can\nhide it all behind a smile.\nThey force a facade of happiness\nto free others from the burden\nof dealing with their problems.\nHowever, there are times\nwhere signs of this facade\nshow behind the cracks and reveal a shell\nof a lonely, sad, and\nhurting human in its wake.\nIn cases like this, sharing\nyour concern with them\nand offering them emotional support\nmay help them significantly.\nWhile it might feel like\nprodding into their business,\nthey need to hear it is okay\nto let others share their burden.\nIn times like these,\nknowing your near and\ndear ones support you\ncan help to a great degree emotionally\nand might also encourage them\nto seek professional help.\nSo, it's better to let them\nknow that you're there for them,\nbut not push the conversation any further\nif they are unwilling.\nHave you seen any signs\nof hidden depression\nthat your friend may be facing above?\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nLeave a comment down below if you'd like.\nPlease feel free
