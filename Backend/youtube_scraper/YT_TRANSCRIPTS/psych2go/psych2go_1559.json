    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nAre there parts of your past\nthat continue to haunt you today?\nWhether it was the toxic\nfamily, a harsh upbringing,\nan abusive relationship\nor a traumatic experience,\nyour past can continue to affect\nhow you think and behave today.\nAfter all, you create from the past,\nuntil you heal from the past.\nHowever, to heal from a difficult past,\nwe need to recognize the signs.\nCurious to know whether your\npast is affecting you today?\nHere are eight signs that\nyou had difficult past.\nNumber one, you don't have\na good relationship with yourself.\nHave you noticed the\nway you treat yourself?\nAre you often your own worst critic?\nPerhaps you struggle\nwith crippling self doubt\nor self-loathing, or maybe you've always\nbeen quick to blame yourself\nthe moment something goes wrong.\nHaving a negative\nrelationship with yourself\ncan be a telltale sign\nthat you're still dealing\nwith or healing from some lingering,\nemotional and psychological wounds.\nLike many people, this may stem\nfrom having a difficult past.\nNumber two, you have\na negative self image.\nHow do you view yourself?\nAnother sign you may\nthey've had a difficult past\nis having a negative\nself image of yourself,\nwhether it's because you grew\nup in a harsh environment\nor because you've experienced\ntrauma at an early age,\nsuch as loss, heartbreak,\nabandonment or abuse.\nThese past experiences\ncan have a large effect\non how you come to see\nand think of yourself.\nSome people may believe that they deserved\nthe bad things that have happened to them.\nAnd others may let what\nthey've gone through\ndefine who they are,\neither way, it can impact your\nself image and self-esteem.\nNumber three, you have trust issues.\nDo you have a hard time trusting others?\nWhether it's having been\nin a toxic relationship\nwith someone, being abandoned\nby a parent at a young age,\nor having had a disruptive home life.\nYour past experiences may have caused you\nto develop trust issues\ntowards other people.\nSince you know firsthand\nhow much it can hurt\nto put your trust in the wrong person,\nyou may struggle to open\nup and be vulnerable\nwith someone again, after all,\nyou can't get hurt by someone\nif you don't get close to them.\nNumber four, you struggle\nwith your relationships.\nIs it hard for you to make close friends?\nBecause of having a difficult past\ncan leave you with a\nlot of negative feelings\ntowards yourself and others,\nit can make it all the more challenging\nfor you to form and maintain\nclose relationships.\nIn some cases, you may find yourself\nattracted towards the\nwrong kinds of people,\nsuch as those who are hurtful\nand to treat you poorly.\nIn other instances, you might develop\na tendency to self\nsabotage your relationships\nby pulling away the moment\nyou start getting close\nto someone, either way,\nhaving a difficult past can\nlead to a fear of commitment\nand emotional intimacy,\nas well as difficulty\nwith being honest, open\nand vulnerable with others.\nNumber five, you tend to self isolate.\nDo you tend to self isolate\nwhenever you're feeling down?\nHaving experienced a\ndifficult and negative past\nmay lead you to become more guarded,\ndetached and self-reliant.\nYou may find it difficult to trust others.\nFind spending time with\npeople too overwhelming\nor struggle to communicate\nhow you genuinely feel.\nAs a result, you may often\nfeel misunderstood and lonely,\neven when in the presence of other people.\nFor this reason, you may develop a habit\nof spending most of your time alone.\nNumber six, you have difficulty\ndealing with your problems.\nAre you easily stressed\nout by your problems\nand find it hard to think clearly,\nPerhaps you always feel panicy\nor overwhelmed when faced\nwith a tiniest of setbacks\nand inconveniences,\nor maybe you react the opposite way,\nby staying in denial and\ndeflecting with humor,\nsarcasm and dismissiveness.\nWhatever the case, this\nstruggle to address\neven the simplest of problems may indicate\nthat you're still struggling to recover\nfrom your past experiences and problems,\nNumber seven, you struggle\nto control your emotions.\nIs it very easy for you to get upset?\nInstead of you controlling your emotions,\ndoes it feel like it's your emotions\nthat are controlling you?\nWhether it's snapping and\nlashing out at people a lot\nor feeling upset and sad\nsuddenly with no good reason,\nyour past experiences can affect\nhow well you're able to\nmanage your emotions.\nBecause your past can leave you\nwith a lot of unresolved\nnegative feelings,\nyou may end up finding\nyourself constantly struggling\nto stay on top of your\nemotions and to reign them in\nwhen you're getting overly emotional\nand number eight, you're\nafraid to be happy.\nDoes the thought of being happy scare you?\nWhile it may sound ridiculous at first,\nthis is actually something a\nlot of people struggle with,\nespecially if they haven't had\nthe easiest time growing up.\nIf you're afraid to let yourself be happy,\nwhich can manifest itself\nthrough self destructive tendencies,\na fear of intimacy or a\ncompulsive desire to self isolate,\nit could be because the\nfeeling is unfamiliar\nand unknown to you.\nCompared to the unfamiliar\nand scary notion of happiness,\nyou may even find comfort\nin the consistency and\nfamiliarity of pain.\nFor this reason, you may\nsell sabotage yourself\nand purposefully do things\nto prevent yourself from being happy.\nDid you relate to any of\nthe signs we've mentioned?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe\nand share this video\nwith those who
