    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nIf you clicked on this video,\nyou're probably wondering if you're smart.\nWhile a great report card\ndoesn't define all types of intelligence,\nthere are a few bizarre habits\na lot of intelligent\npeople happen to share.\nHere are some of the weird habits\nsmart people tend to share\naccording to psychological research.\nOne, you're a night owl.\nCan't go to sleep on time,\nnot just on time, but a reasonable hour?\nA lot of intelligent\npeople share this habit\naccording to research.\nThe London School of Economics\nand Political Science\nconducted a study that found\nthat people who often find\nthemselves going to bed later\nhave higher IQs.\nThe researchers explained in their study\nthat the Savanna-IQ Interaction Hypothesis\nsuggests that more intelligent individuals\nare more likely to acquire and espouse\nevolutionarily novel\nvalues and preferences\nthan less intelligent individuals.\nBut general intelligence has\nno effect on the acquisition\nand espousal of\nevolutionarily familiar values\nand preferences.\nThey go on to explain that\none example of such choice\nwithin genetic constraint\nis circadian rhythms.\nSurvey of ethnographies\nof traditional societies\nsuggest that nocturnal activities\nwere probably rare in the\nancestral environment.\nSo the hypothesis would predict\nthat more intelligent individuals\nare more likely to be nocturnal\nthan less intelligent individuals.\nThe analysis of the\nNational Longitudinal Study\nof Adolescent Health\nconfirms the prediction.\nWith such an instinctive behavior,\nit seems you can't help but\nsense a danger in the night,\nor you just really like staying up late\nand watching YouTube videos.\nTwo, you live in a disorderly environment.\nIs your room a mess, your\nworkspace, your hair?\nWell, a messy environment\nmight not be so bad\nif you value creativity.\nAccording to a research experiment\nfrom the University of Minnesota,\nparticipants in a disorderly room\nwere more creative than\nparticipants in an orderly room.\nThe study says,\n\"Why does creativity spark\nin a messy environment?\"\nResearch scientist, Jonathan Wai, PhD,\nsays that smarter people tend\nto have creativity as a trait,\nwhich can lead to their\nmessy lifestyle or room.\nWai guesses that it's not\nmessiness that helps creativity,\nbut creativity which may create messiness.\nHe goes on to say that such people\ntend to get lost in thought\nfocusing on a problem or issue,\nand crumminess becomes of less importance\nthan focusing on the problem at hand.\nWhile a messy room sounds great\nfor all artists out there,\nit may not be great when it\ncomes to your food choices.\nIn the University of Minnesota study,\ntheir first experiment showed that\nrelative to the participants\nin a disorderly room,\nparticipants in an orderly\nroom chose healthier snacks\nand donated more money\nto clean or not to clean.\nThree, you like to doodle.\nDo you find doodling to\nbe a hobby of its own?\nYour memory may just thank you.\nA 2009 study found that\ntheir subjects in a group that doodled\nperformed better on a monitoring task.\nAnd on a surprise memory test,\nthey recalled 29% more\ninformation than the other group.\nWhat exactly were they doodling?\nThey simply shaded printed shapes\nwhile listening to a phone call.\n(phone ringing)\nSo next time you have to\nremember something important\nduring that class lecture,\nbring the coloring\nbooks, not the textbooks.\nI'm just kidding, kind of.\nFour, you swear.\nTimothy Jay, PhD, a\nwell-known expert in cursing,\nconducted a study with his colleagues\nand found that those who\ncame up with more curse words\ngenerally had a larger vocabulary.\nJay told Medical Daily that\ntaboo or swear word fluency\nis positively correlated\nwith overall verbal fluency.\nDr. Jay told Medical Daily,\nthe more words you\ngenerated in one category\nmeant the more words you\ngenerated in another category\norally and verbally.\nTime to bring out the swear jar\nand start counting your quarters.\nBe prepared to say goodbye\nas you test out this theory.\nHow many swear words can\nyou come up in your head\nin 30 seconds?\nShare with us the number only, folks.\nFive, you daydream a lot.\nCatch yourself daydreaming\nwhile working on that\ngruesome homework assignment?\n(playful upbeat music)\nIt might not be so bad after all.\nThere may be some benefits in\ntaking a quick daydream break\nwhile working on another simple\ntask according to research.\nA 2012 study from the\nUniversity of California\nfound that when subjects\nengaged in an undemanding task\nduring an incubation period\nfrom a demanding task,\nit led to substantial\nimprovements in performance\non previously encountered\nproblems, according to the study.\nAll participants were\ngiven a demanding task.\nSome subjects were given\na break, some no break,\nwhile some were given an\nundemanding task to complete\nthat maximize mind wandering\nbefore they went back\nto the demanding task.\nAccording to the study,\ncritically, the context\nthat improved performance\nafter the incubation period\nwas associated with higher\nlevels of mind wandering.\nThey go on to suggest\nthat this data suggests\nthat engaging in simple external tasks\nthat allow the mind to wander\nmay facilitate creative problem solving.\nSo taking a quick\ndoodling or coloring break\nmight not be so bad when you're\nfaced with a tough problem\non that next assignment.\nIt may give your head some time\nto work out the problem\nin the back of your mind.\nThat is while you're bringing to life\nan Elmo on the pages\nof your coloring book.\nHey, look, he has wings.\nSix, you like sick jokes.\nAccording to a 2017 study\nfrom the University of Vienna,\nsubjects who enjoyed sick\njokes often scored higher\non nonverbal and verbal intelligence.\n159 adults rated sick cartoons.\nAnd then researchers measured participants\nusing psychological and\nstandard intelligence tests.\nWhat were the types of\ncartoons the subjects enjoyed?\nA kind of humor that\ntreats sinister subjects\nlike death, disease,\ndeformity, handicap, or warfare\nwith bitter amusement and\npresents such tragic, distressing\nor morbid topics in humorous terms.\nThe subjects who enjoy\nthese types of cartoons\nscored higher on nonverbal\nand verbal intelligence.\nTry to open up the back of the newspaper\nand read the funnies.\nSo, do you have some\nof these weird habits?\nDo you think it's because you're smart\nor just can't stop watching\nmidnight YouTube videos\nand doodling, not to\nmention the swear jar?\nLet us know your habits in\nthe comments down
