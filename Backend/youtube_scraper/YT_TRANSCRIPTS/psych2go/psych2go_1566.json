    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey there, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nHow happy are you right now?\nAre you someone who struggles\nto find motivation and joy\nin your daily life,\nbut can't figure out why?\nWhat many people don't realize is that\nthere are many small habits\nin your mindset and behaviors\nthat can make you unhappy.\nIf you learn what makes you dissatisfied,\nyou can tailor your life\nto avoid these habits.\nSo with that in mind,\nhere are 10 things you do\nthat make you unhappy without knowing.\nNumber one, ignoring yourself.\nAre you someone who wears yourself out?\nDo you prioritize other people\nover what you truly want?\nWhether you dismiss your wants and needs,\nignore self-care,\nor invalidate your emotions,\nyou may actually be hurting\nyourself and your happiness.\nWorking to tune into\nwho you are as a person\nand what you want\nwill help your motivation\nand sense of balance.\nFinding some time to self-reflect\nupon who you are,\nhow you're doing,\nand your desires\nmight be a great first step.\nNumber two, trying to control\neverything around you.\nDo you constantly try to\ncontrol your surroundings?\nYou may expect people to act a certain way\nor always expect things\nto go the way you planned.\nHowever, trying to control\neverything around you\nwill likely end up\nharming you in the long run.\nLife is so unpredictable and chaotic\nthat it's impossible to expect things\nto happen a certain way.\nIt's important to stay flexible\nand open-minded to new opportunities.\nThat way you can adapt\nto many different types of situations.\nNumber three, seeking\nvalidation from outside sources.\nDo you often compare yourself to others?\nDo you use metrics such as grades\nor work performance to validate\nyour self-worth?\nWhile it's hard not to,\nseeking validation from outside sources\ncan make you unhappy.\nRealize that you're the only one\nwho determines your worth.\nNot friends, family,\ngrades, accomplishments,\nor any other external factors.\nYou don't have to worry\nabout pleasing everyone\nor always being perfect,\nand can focus on being happy\nand living the way you want.\nNumber four, spending\ntoo much time regretting\nand not enough time learning.\nAre you someone who always\nthinks about your mistakes?\nReplaying them over and over,\nwhile speculating what could have been.\nWhile it is extremely difficult\nto overcome your regrets,\nthe past cannot be changed.\nThe only thing you can do\nis learn from your previous mistakes\nand do your best to move forward.\nSpending too much time regretting\nnot only weighs you down,\nbut also prohibits you from getting\nlife experience and knowledge.\nInstead, try to learn from your mistakes\nand use them as opportunities\nto change your present and your future.\nNumber five, neglecting\npersonal relationships.\nWhen was the last time you\ntalked to your friends?\nDo you find yourself canceling plans\ninstead of going out.\nIt may be hard to find time\nto meet up with people\nbecause life gets in the way,\nbut it's important to stay connected.\nHumans are social creatures\nand even introverts need\nsome social contact.\nHaving a strong support system\nwill likely make you\nmore relaxed, balanced,\nand overall make you feel\nuplifted as a person.\nSo even if it's only once a month\nor for a few hours,\ntry to make time to connect\nto the people you love.\nNumber six, surrounding\nyourself with negativity.\nAre you a glass half empty\nor a glass half full type of person?\nDo you find yourself surrounded\nby people who bring you down?\nWhile complaining is certainly\na good way to vent from time to time,\nconstant negativity can\nmake you more unhappy.\nWhen you complain,\nyou're giving your problems\nand inconveniences more power,\nallowing them to linger in your mind\nand further ruin your day.\nSimilarly, by surrounding yourself\nwith negative people,\ntheir problems may become your own.\nIf they're constantly fussing,\nbringing you down\nor manipulating you into helping them,\nit can harm your overall well-being.\nInstead, try to surround yourself\nwith positive people\nthat encourage and uplift you.\nNumber seven, not allowing\nyourself to be happy.\nWhile it may sound obvious,\nmost people don't recognize\nwhen they're self-sabotaging.\nThings like overthinking,\njudging yourself and self-blame\nare destructive behaviors\nthat are often overlooked.\nSometimes these behaviors\nhave deeper roots\nsuch as unhealed trauma, recent crisis,\nor burnout that causes you\nto subconsciously avoid happiness.\nYou might think you don't deserve joy\nor that you need to do better.\nThese types of problems\nare generally best\naddressed through therapy\nor another means of professional support.\nSo don't be afraid to reach out.\nIt doesn't make you weak,\ninferior or crazy.\nNumber eight, overthinking.\nHow often do you stay up at night\nreplaying various worst-case scenarios\nand embarrassing interactions you've had?\nWhile the tendency to overthink is human,\ndoing this too much\nwill only make you more stressed.\nTry to remember that\nat the end of the day,\nno one will remember or care about\nthat one time you made mistake in class\nor said the wrong thing.\nTry to look at an embarrassing situation\nas something to laugh about in the future.\nThat way you're not weighed down\nby over-analyzing yourself.\nYou can then use that time\nto focus on what really matters.\nNumber nine, fantasizing too much.\nDo you find yourself scrolling\nthrough social media,\nwishing your life was like someone else's?\nDo you use phrases like,\n\"When I grow up,\"\nor, \"In a few years.\"\nWhile it may sound cheesy,\nthere really is no better time\nto take action than the present.\nIf you always fantasize about the future,\nyou may end up pretending\nmore than taking action.\nTry not to use social media\nto set unrealistic\nexpectations for yourself.\nInstead, try to put\nyour plans into action.\nAnd number 10, being a perfectionist.\nDo you have to make sure\neverything is just right?\nYou never settle for less\nand would rather give up\nthan make something that is subpar.\nIt's wonderful to have\nstrong attention to detail\nand the ability to work hard.\nHowever, when taken too far,\nit can end up hindering your progress.\nYou may end up obsessing over everything\nand burn yourself out.\nIt can be easy to lose motivation\nand become discouraged\nwhen things don't turn\nout the way they should.\nBut it's important to set that aside\nand learn from your mistakes,\nallowing yourself to fail and learn\nwill allow you to grow.\nBeing able to see your progress\nover time will be much more rewarding\nthan giving up early.\nIt can be easy to fall into a cycle\nthat neglects your personal needs.\nSometimes you may do these things\nwithout even knowing.\nHowever, taking steps to\nimprove your situation\nand get into a better mindset\nwill help improve your wellbeing.\nDo you relate to any of these things?\nIf so, which ones?\nWhat changes are you thinking of making?\nAs always, please reach out\nto a qualified professional\nif you're struggling\nwith your mental health\nto get back on track.\nAlso, feel free to leave a comment\nwith your experiences down
