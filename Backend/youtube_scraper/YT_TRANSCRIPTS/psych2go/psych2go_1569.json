    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever been told that you're shy,\nbut deep inside, you know you're not?\nMaybe you're a bit quiet at times\nand you just don't care for small talk,\nor maybe you find it hard\nto connect with some people,\nbut that doesn't mean you're\nafraid of socializing.\nWell, instead of being shy,\nyou may just be an introvert all along.\nHere are six signs you're\nactually an introvert and not shy.\nNumber one, you have a\nhard time finding people\nyou connect with.\nDo you find it difficult\nconnecting with new people?\nMaybe there aren't a lot\nof people you're interested\nin getting to know, so you're\nunsure of what to talk about.\nIntroverts can take some\ntime to get comfortable\naround someone new,\nwhile extroverts get their energy\nby meeting new people and socializing.\nIntroverts don't energize this way.\nThey may often need to have\nsome time alone to recharge.\nOften with introverts,\nif they're not intrigued\nby someone or interested,\nthey won't invest too much energy in them.\nIt's only when they\ngradually get to know them\nand feel a connection\nthat they really want to\nspend more time socializing.\nNumber two, when you do\nconnect with someone,\nyou're pretty social with them.\nSo, what happens when you\ndo connect with someone?\nDespite others calling you shy,\nyou still love socializing,\nas long as it's with your close friends.\nIf you've formed a\nconnection with a friend,\nyou may find yourself inviting\nthem over to hang out,\nversus going out to an overcrowded party,\nbut you definitely don't\nneed to despise socializing.\nYou just prefer some alone time\nin those calm moments with\nfew of your close friends.\nNumber three.\nPeople describe your\nconversations as intense.\nSo, you're at a get together\nwhen you decide to bring up\nthe existential questions\nyou've been pondering all week,\nor well, maybe just a\ndeeper topic than others\nare used to discussing casually.\nBut everyone kind of just stares\nat you a bit uncomfortable.\nSome may join along with\nthe interesting topic,\nwhile others describe your\nconversations as intense.\nAs an introvert, you're quite\nthe philosopher at times.\nYou take pleasure in deep conversations,\nor discussing an intriguing\nbook you've just read.\nYou also don't mind a fun\ndebate every now and then,\nso long as it's not small talk.\nYou're good.\nNumber four.\nYour energy feels drained\nwhen around crowds too long.\nHow do you gain energy?\nDo you go out of the\nhouse to meet new people,\nor do you stay home with a good book\nand a cup of Joe to recharge?\nIntroverts often enjoy spending time alone\nrather than socializing.\nThey still like to be social,\nbut often find themselves\nchoosing to stay in\nrather than go out.\nAfter a day at work or\nafter a crowded event,\nthey may feel drained,\ncrowded rooms and noisy places\nmay just take up all of their energy.\nSo an afternoon alone will\ngive them some time to recharge\nfor the rest of their day.\nNumber five.\nYou are not a fan of small talk.\nSo, we've mentioned\nthat introverts love\ninteresting conversations\nthat are often philosophical or emotional,\nbut did we mention their\ndistaste for small talk?\nThey don't need to have a hatred for it,\nbut they certainly\ndon't enjoy starting it.\nIf you find it difficult\nto engage in small talk\nor are unsure of what to say\nwhen initializing this\ntype of conversation,\nthen you may just be an introvert,\nsmall talk to you may\njust seem fake or forced,\nso you prefer to do without it.\nYou're not quiet because you're shy,\nyou're just saving your energy\nfor more interesting conversations.\nAnd number six.\nYour mind's always running\nan inner monologue,\nand you're often distracted.\nDo you get distracted easily?\nIs your mind always racing\nwith an inner monologue,\nor maybe you drift off\ninto your imagination.\nWhen out in public, the noise\nand chaos of certain venues\nmay be distracting for some introverts.\nSince they're not always a fan\nof starting up a conversation\nwith someone they don't\nfeel a connection with,\nthey may just entertain\nthemselves with their thoughts.\nThis may be one of the\nreasons you're often described\nas the quiet one.\nYou're simply thinking all the time,\nand are busy with your thoughts.\nSometimes they're entertaining,\nsometimes you're running scenarios.\nIt may also be a bit distracting\ntoo if you're in class,\nbut hey, if you're in line\nfor sushi during lunch\nand have nothing else to\ndo, knock yourself out.\nAh, imagination.\nSo are you an introvert or\ndo you think you're shy?\nDo you relate to any of these points\nor are you an extrovert who's\nhere for the entertainment?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe'd love to hear from our fans.\nWe hope you enjoyed this video.\nAnd if you did, don't forget\nto click
