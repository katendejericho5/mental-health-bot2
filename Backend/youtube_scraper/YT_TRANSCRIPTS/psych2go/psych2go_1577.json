    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHave you ever wondered what\nyour nightmares really mean?\nCould your subconscious be\ntrying to tell you something?\nMany psychologists work\nwith their patients\nto interpret dreams.\nSigmund Freud, the\nfounder of psychoanalysis,\nbelieved repressed concepts and wishes\ncould be found in dreams.\nWhile your own dreams likely\nhave personal meanings\nthat only you can interpret.\nThere are a few common nightmares\nthat have been said to\nhave some strong meanings.\nSo, here are six common nightmares\nand what they really mean.\nNumber one, being unprepared for a test.\nHave you ever had one of these dreams?\nMany people seem to.\nYou haven't studied at\nall for the important test\nwhen suddenly, you find yourself\nseated, ready to take it.\nThe clock quickly starts to tick\nand you have no idea\nwhat the first answer is.\nThis type of nightmare,\nwhere one finds themselves\nunprepared for the\nimportant test or assignment\nrepresents a lack of confidence.\nYou obviously can't take the\ntest since you haven't studied,\nso any confidence in\nacing the exam is absent.\nThis nightmare could also mean\nyou're having a tough time advancing\nto the next phase of your life.\nNumber two, drowning.\nHave you ever found yourself\ndrowning in a dream?\nIf so, this could mean\nyou've been feeling overwhelmed lately.\nIn the waking world, you find\nyourself emotionally involved\nin a commitment or situation.\nYou may find yourself in over your head\nand engulfed in the deep\nend of the situation.\nSee what I did there?\nNumber three, teeth falling out.\nHave you ever woken up from a nightmare\nfrantically feeling to see if\nyour teeth have fallen out?\nWell, if you have dreams\nwhere your teeth fall out,\nthis could be symbolic of any insecurities\nof your appearance.\nYou make it anxious about\nhow others may judge you\nor your appearance.\nIf you often have strong\nfeelings of embarrassment\nor fear of rejection,\nthis is likely more true.\nNumber four, being chased.\nWho hasn't been chased in a dream before?\nIt can be pretty terrifying.\nAnd it may feel as if your\nlegs suddenly stop working\nright when you need to run.\nIf you find yourself\nchased in a nightmare,\nthis could really mean\nthat you're running away from something\nin real life as well.\nMaybe you've been avoiding\nsomething important.\nMaybe you don't like to face\nthese issues as you should be.\nSome believe that whoever is chasing you\ncould be a representation\nof a part of you.\nAre your feelings of anger\ncoming back to haunt you?\nAnd let's hope not.\nBetter try to wake up\nand practice working\nthrough your anger or fear\nwith a counselor or talk about\nit with someone you trust.\nNumber five, being late\nor missing an event.\nHave you ever been late to an\nimportant event in your dream,\na theater performance, an\nimportant job interview,\nhow about being late to that test\nyou weren't prepared for?\nBeing late or missing an event\ncan mean that you feel you're\nmissing out on an opportunity\nto feel fulfilled.\nTime is seemingly running out for you\nand it seems you must\nhurry and make a choice.\nYou may be anxious about a\nbig discussion in your life\nthat may steer you towards\nan entirely new path.\nIt's best to take a breath and realize\nyou have enough time to figure this out.\nTalk with someone about\nthis important decision\nor lack of fulfillment.\nYou may not be as fearful\nwhen a new opportunity arises.\nIt could lead you somewhere new.\nAnd this doesn't always\nhave to be a scary thing.\nIt can be exciting too.\nAnd number six, being naked in a dream.\nWhat a classic.\nBeing naked in a dream.\nSuddenly, you find yourself\nin a crowded auditorium\nand nothing but your\nunderwear or nothing at all.\nThis can symbolize a fear you\nhave of one day being exposed.\nYour emotional insecurities\nout for everyone to see.\nMaybe you're not as\nvulnerable as they should be.\nMaybe you attempt to put on a strong face\nwhen really being more vulnerable\nis the release you need.\nThis dream could be a reflection of that\nas well as feelings of\nuncertainty about a topic,\nor about yourself and who you are.\nIt's okay to be more vulnerable\naround those around you.\nOne of the worst feelings is pretending\nto be someone you're not.\nSo, don't shy away from those feelings.\nShow the world who you are,\nand just maybe not all of you.\nIn your next dream, it's\nbest to keep your pants on.\nSo, which nightmare have\nyou experienced before?\nWhat do you think it means?\nOr are there any symbols in your dream\nthat led you to an\ninteresting interpretation?\nLet us know in the comments.\nWe'd love to hear from you.\nIf you like this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with someone\nwho's been having\ninteresting dreams lately.\nSubscribed to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd as always, thanks for watching."
