    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nSo you have a crush\nand you're trying to figure out what to do\nso you don't embarrass yourself.\nYeah, we've all been there before.\nIf you've been terrified you're\ngoing to do something wrong\nin front of them, then worry not.\nWe're here to tell you seven things\nyou should definitely\nnot do around your crush.\nNumber one, come on too strong.\nFirst of all,\nthere's nothing wrong with\nbeing straightforward.\nAnd if you're one of those\nrare few who are brave enough\nto actually confess to their\ncrush how they really feel,\nthen that's great!\nKudos to you.\nWith that said, however,\nthere is a difference\nbetween being forthcoming\nand being too forceful.\nThe last thing you wanna\ndo is scare your crush off\nor make them uncomfortable\nby coming on too strong,\nsuch as constantly fawning over them,\nstalking them wherever they go, and so on.\nNumber two, fantasize\nabout your future together.\nYeah, remember what we said\nabout not coming on too strong?\nThis definitely falls under that category.\nSaying anything along the lines of,\n\"Oh, I can't wait for\nyou to meet my family.\nThey're going to love you!\"\nOr \"You're gonna be my\nfuture wife or husband,\njust you wait,\" isn't as\nsmooth of a pickup line\nas you might think.\nTo tell you the truth, it's\nactually kind of creepy\nif you say it to someone\nyou aren't even in a\ncommitted relationship with.\nFantasizing about an imagined future\nwith your crush is sweet and all,\nbut it's something you're\nbetter off keeping to yourself.\nOtherwise it comes across\nas incredibly obsessive and presumptive.\nNumber three, send mixed signals.\nYou wanna be careful\nnot to send your crush\nany mixed signals either,\nbecause if one minute\nyou're having a really\ngood time talking to them\nand the next you seem to act\nlike they don't even exist,\nthen how are they even supposed to feel?\nSending mixed signals\nlike this makes them think\nthat you don't care about their feelings\nand that this is all\njust a big game to you.\nNumber four, act like you don't care.\nArguably, the only thing worse\nthan sending your crush mixed signals\nis acting like you don't\ncare about them at all,\nto the point where you\nmight even start to come off\nas rude and inconsiderate.\nHiding the way you feel is one thing,\nbut to ignore, criticize,\nor disrespect someone\njust because you can't deal\nwith your feelings for them\nis completely unacceptable.\nBe careful you don't cross\nthe line from playful teasing\nand banter to actually\nhurting their feelings.\nNumber five, pretend to\nbe someone you're not.\nNow, whether we like to admit it or not,\nthe truth is most of\nus have probably tried\nto change a few things about ourselves\nto impress our crush\nand get them to like us.\nAnd hey, that's okay.\nIt's only natural that you'd\nwanna make a good impression\non someone you feel attracted to.\nThe problem, however,\nlies in trying too hard\nto the point that we start pretending\nto be someone we're not.\nAnd as cheesy and cliche\nas it might sound,\nthere's no denying that if\nyou really want your crush\nto like you, then you\nshould just be yourself\nand let them get to\nknow you, the real you.\nNumber six, act jealous or possessive.\nHave you ever acted jealous\ntowards the other people\nyour crush seems to spend\na lot of time with?\nOr dislike certain people they seem to be\nespecially friendly with?\nWhile it's only natural\nto feel a bit jealous\nof those people your crush\nseems to be close to,\nespecially if you feel there\nmight be something there,\nthe truth is you don't\nreally have any right\nto act possessive over\nyour crush because of it.\nThink about it.\nHow would you feel if someone liked you\nand then just suddenly\nstarted acting jealous\nto all of your friends\nand telling you that you\nspend too much time with them?\nIt's a huge turnoff, right?\nBecause it makes them\ncome off as insecure,\ncontrolling, and needy.\nAnd number seven, overthink everything.\nFinally, but perhaps most importantly,\none of the biggest ways\nwe ruin our own chances\nwith our crush is by overthinking\nevery little thing we do around them.\nWe get so lost in our own heads sometimes,\nagonizing over every tiny detail,\nfrom the way we look to the way we talk,\nto the way we come across,\nthat every interaction with them\nfeels like a needlessly complicated\nemotional rollercoaster.\nWorst of all, they\nprobably didn't even notice\nor don't even care about any of that stuff\nyou're overthinking about.\nSo what's the point?\nChill out, take a breath, and relax.\nIt'll help you be more\nconfident around your crush\nand let them get to know the real you.\nSo, do you relate to any of\nthe things we've listed here?\nHave you ever done any\nof these seven things\nyou shouldn't do around your crush?\nWell, even if you\nanswered yes, that's okay.\nAt least you know better now.\nAnd hey, there's nothing\nto be embarrassed about.\nWe all act a little silly\nand get tongue-tied around\nthe people we like sometimes.\nWhat matters most is that\nyou stay true to yourself\nand take things slow.\nThen, when you're confident enough,\nshoot your shot and see what happens.\nWe'll be rooting for you.\nDid this video help you?\nPlease like and share it with
