    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Go-ers.\nInitiating a bit of flirtation\nand romance can be difficult,\nespecially if you're unsure\nif the person you like feels\nthe same way about you.\nHow does your crush view you?\nAre there any clues as\nto if they like you?\nWell, here are six signs\nyour crush doesn't romantically like you.\nNumber one,\nthey don't pay attention to\nyou at all in a large group.\nDoes your crush pay\nattention to you at parties?\nYou may be the best of buds\nwhen you're working on\nassignments in class,\nbut as soon as there's\na large group of people,\nyou're seemingly last on\nthe list to interact with.\nThis is an easy sign your\ncrush doesn't like you\nas much as you'd hoped.\nWhen we're attracted to someone,\nwe wanna be close to\nthem or alone with them\nto get to know more about them.\nIt's important to recognize\nyou aren't the center of their world,\nbut if someone likes you,\neven a good friend,\nthey shouldn't be completely\nditching you during an event\nat the first sign of\ninteraction from others.\nIf they subtly try to ignore you,\nthere's still good news.\nYou're at a party!\nThere's plenty of interesting individuals\nto talk to and make friends with.\nNumber two,\nthey keep distance and put up barriers\nbetween the two of you.\nDoes your crush often talk to you\nwith their body turned away?\nDo they subconsciously hold\ntheir bag in front of them?\nDo they scoot away when you speak to them?\n(groans) Well, according to\npsychologist Jack Schafer,\n\"People lean towards people they like\nand distance themselves\nfrom people they dislike.\nInward leaning increases\nas rapport increases,\"\nmeaning you may first turn\nyour head toward someone,\nthen your shoulders,\nfollowed by your torso.\nThen if you're really interested\nin what someone has to say,\nyou'll lean towards them.\nSo when someone is\nattracted to another person,\nodds are they may just lean towards them\nwhen they get the chance.\nNot just for a kiss,\nbut because they are deeply interested\nin what you have to say and who you are.\nDr. Jack Schafer also\nexplains in \"Psychology Today\"\nthat people who like each other\nremove any obstacles between them.\nHe continues to say a barrier\ndoes not necessarily mean\nthat the person doesn't like you,\nbut it does let you know\nthat rapport has not yet been established.\nSo, that bag in front of them\nmay not mean they hate you,\nbut it may just show that\nrapport isn't as strong\nas you'd hoped it to be.\nNumber three,\nthey ghost you or always\ntake long pauses to reply.\nDoes your crush leave\nyou on read for days?\nWell, taking days to respond\nto a simple question or a\ntext is often a clear signal\nthey're not that into you.\nIf they ghost you,\nthat should be further proof.\nPerhaps they have a good explanation\nas to why they've been absent,\nbut most times, ghosting is a clear sign\nthey don't view you in that way.\nNumber four,\nyou always initiate the talking.\nDo you initiate all the\nconversations with your crush?\nYou always ask them first\nhow they are in class.\nYou're always the first\nto reach out through text.\nWell, this is a good sign they\njust aren't that into you.\nIf someone likes you\nromantically or as a friend,\nthey'll make an effort to\nstart a conversation with you\nand ask about your general\nwellbeing at the least.\nIf they don't seem to care,\nit's best to move on and talk\nto someone who actually does.\nEven just a, \"How are you?\"\nshows they may at least care as a friend.\nNumber five,\nyou are the only one who\nasks to meet up or hang out.\nSo, you may or may not\nhave just been on a date\nwith the person you admire,\nbut every time you do\nmake plans and hang out,\nyou're the one asking them out.\nYou put all the effort\ninto the relationship,\nfriendly or romantic.\nLet's say you happen to be\nalone with them by chance\nafter lunch or school.\nIf you're still the only one thinking\nof what interesting\nthings you could be doing\nto fill the time,\nthey likely don't view you\nas a romantic interest.\nAnd number six,\nthey don't smile or laugh at your jokes.\nAre you the class clown?\nDo you like a good joke here or there?\nDoes your crush smile at\nyour futile attempts at jokes\nor do they sit there blank-faced?\nGenerally, if you like someone,\nyou'll often smile around them.\nIf that someone tries\nto make a cheesy joke,\nyou'll often wanna smile\nat their attempt anyway.\nPeople often don't want to\nappear cold to their crush,\nso even a polite smile is\ncommon if they like you.\nIf they opt out of smiling when\ntalking with you completely,\nit's likely a sign your crush\nsimply doesn't like you.\nBut don't worry, (chuckles)\nI think your jokes are funny.\nSo, do you notice any of\nthese signs from your crush?\nIf you're still unsure of how they feel,\nit might be a good idea to just ask them\nor let them know how you feel about them.\nEven if they let you know they\ndon't like you in that way,\nthere are plenty of fish in the sea.\nYeah, it's a common phrase,\nbut it's true!\nJust remember, if they don't\nlaugh at your silly jokes,\nodds are there's someone\nout there who will,\nso keep your heart and mind\nopen and keep on smiling,\neven at your own jokes.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't
