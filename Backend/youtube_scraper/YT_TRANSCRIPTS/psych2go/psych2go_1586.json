    "transcript": "(soft ambient music)\n- [Narrator] It's that time of year again.\nWe students are back in school,\nworking on projects,\nwriting papers,\nand with exams,\njust around the corner.\nNothing is more relatable than stress.\nI am stressed, you are stressed,\nwe all are, in some way.\nAnd it's actually okay to be stressed.\nIn fact,\nstress is our response to\nchanges in our environment,\ngiving us a signal to adapt\nthe changes in our lives.\nOur bodies release hormones\nthat prepare us to deal with these changes\nor in some situations,\nrun away from the problem.\nAs university students,\nit is important for us to realize\nthat we are here to learn and grow.\nAnd with that,\ncomes various challenges\nand no challenge comes without stress.\nWe can define stress as a\npositive or negative element\nto our mental health.\nBut if we recognize stress as\na positive and adaptive signal\nto our mental health,\nstress can be used to our benefit,\npromoting growth, success, and prosperity.\nHow stress affects our mental health,\nexcluding extreme or\nspecial circumstances,\nis generally within our power.\nIdentifying the cause of the stress\nand adapting to it in a\nhealthy and effective manner,\nwill not only improve our mental state,\nbut also give you a new\nsense of appreciation\nof your body's stress response.\nIn addition,\nevery time we are presented\nwith a daily stressor\nand are forced to adapt to it,\nour mental state is\nfortified and ready to adapt\nto potential stressors.\n(soft ambient music)\nHaving said that,\nwhile some stress can be beneficial\nfor our growth and success,\nwhen we have too much stress\nfor an extended period of time,\nwithout allowing ourselves\ntime to recharge,\nthat is when stress begins to take a toll\non our overall health.\nRecharging is a healthy action\nand encourages the sustainability\nof our crazy busy student lives.\nListening to music, chatting\nwith people you care about,\ndisconnecting from social media.\nThese are just some of the\nways that you can recharge\nin a healthy manner.\nGuilt-free.\n(soft ambient music)\nYou need to be accountable for your health\nand forgive yourself\nif you feel you are not\nperforming to your best ability\ndue to multiple stressful\nevents going on in your life.\nAs much as our bodies like and\nrequire social interaction,\nwe may also need some time to ourselves\nto focus and reestablish a clear mindset.\nThis doesn't have to be sending yourself\nto solitary confinement.\nYou can spend time with friends,\nyou could go outside to\nspend time in nature,\nor you could do something creative,\nsuch as going to a painting class.\nThe most important part,\nis to do anything that helps ground you\nand prepare you for your goals.\nAs we mentioned earlier,\nmost everyday stress is normal\nand is a signal to adapt\nto something in our lives.\nIt helps us get through\nobstacles in our lives,\nbut it can be unhealthy\nwhen we have too much over a long period\nand neglect the basics.\nSleep, nutrition, exercise\nand connecting with others.\nAdapting to stress leads to a\nmore and more resilient mind\nand improved coping skills.\nEveryone's stressors\nand reactions to stress,\nare very different.\nIt may take some time to\nlearn what works for you,\nbut keep trying and try\nnot to stress about it.\nSo, what is stressing you or\nare you stressing about today?\nWhat would you do differently\nto combat your stress?\nThis project was made possible\nby UBC Social Impact Lab\nand its partners.\nFor more details,\ncheck the video description."
