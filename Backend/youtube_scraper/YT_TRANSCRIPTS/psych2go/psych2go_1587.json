Bradwejn.\nSo welcome, Dr. Bradwejn.\n- Hi, Monica.\n- Hello.\nThank you for joining us.\nSo, Dr. Bradwejn-\n- And happy to be back.\n(Monica and Jacques laugh)\n- Yeah, Dr. Bradwejn is a\npsychiatrist trained in medicine\nat the University of Sherbrooke,\nand psychiatry at McGill University.\nHe is a Professor Emeritus\nand ex-Dean of Medicine\nat the University of Ottawa, Founding

today's discussion.\nPsych2Go hopes to host more\nof these educational media\ninterventions to make psychiatry\nand psychology accessible to all.\nWelcome, Dr. Bradwejn.\n- Thank you.\nI'm glad to be back.\n- Very, very happy that\nyou're able to be back.\nI'm sure a lot of people enjoyed watching\nour last livestream about anxiety,\nwhich you can find on our channel.\nSo I thought let's just\nbegin with a question\nthat really puts this whole\nlivestream about depression\nand depressive disorders into context.\nAnd this is actually most\ncommonly asked question\non our YouTube community.\nSo someone has asked us to\nprovide an overview about some\nof the types of depressive\ndisorders and the common signs\nto look out for.\n- Okay.\nSo the basic question\nis what is depression?\nI think it's a good first question.\nSo depression simply is\nwhen generally we feel low,\neverything is low, everything\nis dark, everything is hard,\nso at the level of our body,\nwe may not have much energy,\nwe may not have much\nappetite, we can't sleep much,\nwe may have also lots of aches and pains.\nAnd then emotionally, either\nit's empty, we feel empty,\nwe feel sad.\nWe may feel a lot of guilt\nand some irritability.\nIn terms of our thoughts,\ndifficulty concentrating\nand keeping attention,\nwe think slow,\nand often we think in\na very pessimistic way,\neven thinking that life is\nnot worth it and thinking\nof hurting oneself and so on.\nAnd also behavior, we tend to isolate.\nWe tend to not feel to do\nthings, not wanting to do things,\nnot meet people and isolate,\nand generally, our self-esteem is low\nand we don't feel very good.\nSo overall, that is depression.\nIt's also called a major depression,\nmajor depressive disorder,\nit depends what the diagnostic\nsystems that are used,\nbut basically that's depression.\nSo that's the experience of depression.\nAnd then there are different\ntypes of depression.\nSo some that are just come once and go.\nSo it's major depression, one episode.\nThere are some depression\nthat tend to come back,\nso meaning that the last a few months,\nthey're very painful,\nbut things get better,\nthings get normal, and then\nmaybe a few months later,\na few years later, another\nexperience of depression,\nso these may be called\nrecurrent, recurrent depression.\nSo meaning that they come back often.\nThere's also a type of depression\nwhich is similar to major depression,\nbut not that intense, but always there.\nSo it's a depression that is milder,\nalways there, and so sometime\nit's called dysthymia\nor persistent depressive disorder.\nSo it's not like a down and\nthen back up and over again,\nit's always a bit down.\nAlways a bit having to\npush oneself to feel good,\nso it's always there,\nso it's a persistent type of depression.\nAnd then another type,\nwhich is very important\nto see the difference\nis that the combination\nof major depression,\nso when everything is low, dark, slow,\nbut then with episodes that\neverything is the opposite,\neverything is high, everything is bright,\neverything is good.\nSo for example, the opposite\nof being tired, lots of energy,\nthe opposite of being sad\nis being euphoric feeling\non top of the world, that\nmind goes very, very quick,\ndoing a lot of things,\noften socializing a lot,\nspending a lot of money, that's\ncalled hypomania or mania,\nand in combination with major depression,\nthe low and the high is when you hear\nabout bipolar disorder,\nbasically, bipolar disorder.\nIt's a bit of a different type.\n- Oh, wow!\nThat's really useful to know.\nI think a nice follow-up question\nis that once people notices the signs\nof having trouble sleeping,\nlow mood and things are\ntypically associated\nwith depression,\nhow would you recommend\nsomeone to prevent this\nfrom spiraling or getting any worse?\n- Yes.\nWell, the usual is to\nseek professional help\nto at least get a good evaluation,\nto make sure that it is depression,\nand to understand how\nit became depression.\nWhy?\nWhy?\nAnd myself, why am I depressed?\nSo then with a good evaluation,\nit's possible to determine,\ndo I have a family history?\nDoes depression run in the family,\nor is it a depression\nplus bipolar illness?\nThat's important to know.\nAnd so is it also because of some\nof my psychological habits?\nDoes that contribute to it?\nHave I tended to isolate myself\nthat would contribute to this?\nSo a good evaluation will\ndetermine partly the cause,\nso the biological cause,\nthe psychological and the social cause,\nand confirm the diagnosis.\nSo that's the first thing to do.\nSo then based on that,\na good treatment plan can be devised,\nbecause a good treatment plan,\nand there are very good treatments,\nmany work very well,\nbut it has to be well, well tailored,\ntailored to each individual.\nSo that's why a good evaluation is the key\nto get a good treatment plan.\n- Right.\nAnd for those looking\nto seek that professional treatment plan,\nwho do they typically go to?\nAre they therapists,\npsychologists, psychiatrists?\nDo you mind breaking that\ndown a little further\nfor our younger audience\nmembers who may not know?\n- Yeah.\nSo at first, it may be any\nprimary care professional,\noften family physician,\nor sometime at school,\nit could be health services,\nstudent services for to\nget that first evaluation,\nand based on that,\nthen there could be more access\nto either a psychologist,\nif the main treatment\nwill be psychological,\nit could be also the family\nphysician with a psychologist\nif there needs to be\nmedication, if there needs\nto, in addition to\npsychological treatment.\nSometime the diagnosis\nis not clear or treatment\nhas been suggested\nbut doesn't work quite\nas well as expected,\nso there may be a need for a consultation,\nwith evaluation with a psychiatrist,\nso go deeper into what may\nbe the diagnosis, the causes,\nand more suggestions for treatment.\nSo it's really, it's a continuum,\nbut first reach out, is to\nreach out, if it's a school,\nstudent services, primary care system,\nsome mental health community centers,\ndepending also where on lives\nand how care is organized.\nBasically reach out and then\neventually there can be access\nto the proper help\nand eventually more\nspecialized help if necessary.\n- Great, that's-\n- There's another point too,\nthat if one feels so bad\nthat everything is so dark,\neverything is so painful,\nthat life doesn't feel worth it anymore\nand having ideas of death,\nideas of hurting oneself,\nideas of suicide,\nthen any emergency\nrule, or in some places,\nthere are some crisis lines by phone\nthat can be reached as\nsometimes there's a system\nof with the mobile crisis\nteam or the emergency room,\nbecause then they could be right away,\ngood evaluation and a good access,\naccess to services, because it's serious.\nIt's serious.\nIt's like having any other medical problem\nthat may be very intense, very acute,\nso have to give the care right away.\n- Yeah.\nIt's very good to speak to\nthe importance of reaching out\nas soon as one notices some signs\nthat can become quite distressing.\nBut I do know that many\npeople who commented\nin the community said\nthat it's quite difficult\nto get that courage or even\nhave that access to care.\nAnd so what are your\nthoughts or advice for that,\nfor people that not necessarily reach out?\n- Yes, probably you're quite right\nbecause part of the\nexperience of depression\nis losing hope, right?\nFeeling hopeless, feeling helpless,\nfeeling that things won't work out,\nnot having trust,\nand not having much energy\nsometime to do things,\nso it's very hard to reach out,\nbut that's at a time where at minimum,\ncall, call a friend, call a family member,\nif you're a student, just to\ngo to the school health center\nor some time to employee\nhealth, reach out.\nReach out, I know it's hard,\nbut that effort is really necessary,\nbecause, yeah, there's no\nhope when we're depressed.\nSo we don't even think about\nthings that may be able\nto get better,\nthat there are some good\ntreatments I think could go well,\nand there's a lots of perspective\nthe things well, well\nand they get well again,\nbecause it's the moment and\nit's painful and it's dark.\nSo it's to have a bit of\nhope, have a bit of trust\nand reach out, reach out.\n- For sure.\nYeah, hope is a really,\nreally big part of it,\nand on that topic of kind of factors\nthat can improve depressive\nor factors that can hurt it,\nwould you like to talk about\nthe kind of beneficial things\nto do or personality or\nlike attitudes to have\nversus the not so beneficial ones\nthat can extend the\nexperience of depression?\n- Yeah.\nSo during a depression,\nso we're talking more\nof a treatment, right?\nTreatment because it's serious,\nit's painful and something to be done.\nSo in the same way that we\nmay understand depression\nand the various subtypes of depression\nas a bio-psycho-social\nsuffering issue, right?\nThere may be some biology\nthe way our body functions,\nour brain, there may be some genetics,\nsome psychological ways\nthat we have that may not be\nvery conducive to feeling well\nand social isolation,\nthen the health\nis also along the\nbio-psycho-social dimension.\nSo what does bio mean?\nSometimes it means a bit\nof behavioral activation\nto do a bit, to start to do a bit,\neven if it's working a bit,\nis even though it's very difficult,\nbut to be a bit active, eat well,\navoid as much as possible\nsubstances, alcohol,\nbecause it can worsen\nproblems of depression,\nand medication may be necessary.\nSo there are many different\ntypes of medication\nthat can help a lot.\nSo that's the biological aspect of it.\nPsychologically, they are\ntherapies that have been shown\nto work very well to be fictitious.\nSo we talk about cognitive\nbehavior therapy for depression,\nthat can work very well.\nSo modifying thoughts, dark thoughts,\nbut also some of the behavior\nand also the emotions.\nSo cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.\nThere's a form also of\ntherapy that is based\non the life transitions and relationships\ncalled interpersonal therapy, IPT.\nIt is also a very good technique.\nThere is some, what we\ncall biological activation,\nso there are many tools,\nmany tools that can be a\nuseful to really get out\nof the depression.\nThe social aspect of it, bio-cycle-social,\nthe social aspect of it is very important\nbecause when we suffer from depression,\nor even from anxiety,\nthere's a tendency to do less socially.\nThere's a tendency to isolate\nand have less social contact.\nSo that in itself becomes a problem\nbecause it's like a deprivation.\nSo it causes a harm to be\nalone and not to connect\nwith people we like and\npeople we feel good with.\nSo that social isolation has\nto be reversed in the sense\nto reach out, to do more,\nthat's part of the\ntreatment as for a training,\nbecause social contact, social activities,\nnetwork, it not only feeds wellness,\nbut it can also help doing a\nrecovery, bio-cycle social.\nSo the whole thing, it's\na whole package, really,\nof interventions that can be used and done\nto get out of depression.\n- Yeah.\nThat's definitely very good to know,\nthe vast array of tools\nthat are available.\nAnd on that topic of treatments,\nare there any specific\nkinds or like combinations\nthat typically you would\nrecommend someone to seek out,\nor do you think that\npeople should just be open\nto whichever their\npractitioner recommends?\n- Well, to be open to whatever\nthe science has shown,\nwhatever we know works.\nMany clinicians such as myself\nsee the beneficial effects\nof a treatment,\nespecially a well-tailored,\ncomplete treatment,\nbio-psycho-social, they work.\nThey do work.\nSo when that is recommended\nto to trust, to try.\nMedication treatment,\nthere are many medications\nthat can work well, the\nkey is to choose them well,\nthe first medication to\nadjust medication well,\nto set the goals and combine\nit with psychological tools.\nSo sometime the combination,\nand depends on the people,\non the person's wishes,\nsometime, it can be a combined treatment.\nSo the person says, yeah, I'm depressed.\nI don't mind taking medication.\nI wanna get out of, I suffer so much,\nI'll take medication,\nand I also want to try\nthe psychological tools\nthat you may offer to me\nand I'll do my best.\nSo I think the whole package, right?\nAnd then so it's like\na combined treatment.\nSometimes people prefer\nto start with medication,\nand after that,\nmaybe use more of the psychological tools,\nthey'd rather take the medication and wait\nfor things to get better.\nSo that's more sequential,\nor the other way around,\nI'll start with, depending on the urgency\nand how deep the depression\nis, some people will say,\nI'll try without medication,\nlike cognitive behavioral therapy\nor interpersonal therapy, for example,\nand that may be sufficient, that may work,\nbut if it's not, then\nmedication can be added.\nSo it's sequential, one after the other.\nSo yes, so to trust them,\nto believe because trusting and believing\nand trying gives a good\nchance of getting well,\nbecause these treatments can work,\ncan work very well.\n- Great.\nAnd when you say work,\ndo you think someone can\nexpect for their depression\nto fully go away or for them\nto just expect a reduction\nin their symptoms so that\nthey are now functional?\nWhat kind of outcome are we kind of-\n- Yes.\nSo it all depends on the person,\nall depends on how many depressions,\nif it's recurrent and\nhard life habits were,\nbut setting goals is very important.\nAnd so there's the goal of betterness,\nI wanna get better, so\nless symptom, less sadness,\nbetter sleep, eating\nbetter, having more energy.\nThat's good.\nThat's good, just to come\nout of the depression,\nbut it's also always good to say\nI would like to go beyond betterness.\nI would like to be at wellness.\nAt this point,\nit's more, I wanna be well,\nand what can I do?\nThe way I think, the way I feel,\nin my relationships, in my life,\nwhat can I do to not only\nget well, but stay well?\nSo that's when any good\nmental health practice,\nwhichever you like, right?\nSo it is good to stay, not\nonly stay out of depression,\nbut continue to be well.\nSo goals are important.\nAt first it may be betterness,\nbut at some point, one\nhas to decide for oneself,\ndo I really want wellness?\nAnd what am I willing to do?\nRight?\nTo stay well.\nBecause at first, it's hard.\nIt takes effort, it takes some discipline,\nbut as things get better,\nthen it's a simpler to organize one's life\nand wellbeing as a path of wellness,\nas a path of a good mental health wellness\nto good practices,\npsychological practices,\ngood diet, good exercise,\ndoing a bit of mind and body\nexercises are many there.\nSo that maintains wellness.\n- That's awesome to know.\nJust for those joining us today\nand just joined us,\n'cause I see a couple of\npeople have just joined,\nwe are doing a livestream.\nMy name is Monica, and I'm\njoined with Dr. Bradwejn to talk\nabout depressive disorders\nand ways to maintain wellness.\nAnd all the topic that\nwe were just discussing,\nwe will be talking about ways to optimize,\nenhance one's experience of\nhappiness later on the stream,\nso make sure you stay\ntuned and listen to that.\nSo now we've already just\ncovered the general kind\nof basic understanding of\ndepression, depressive disorders,\nand I thought it might\nbe a good opportunity\nto answer some more specific questions\nthat the community has asked.\nHow does that sound?\n- Yeah, sounds very good.\n- Awesome.\nSo a user by the name of Yellow\nMellow on YouTube has asked,\n\"Why can a person experience\nfeelings of being depressed\n\"when there is no obvious reason for it?\n\"In other words,\n\"it just seems to come on suddenly\n\"without an obvious explanation,\n\"making it harder to really\nidentify a root cause.\"\n- Yes, because, and again,\nthe concept of\nbio-cycle-social can be useful,\nbecause one may have a nice personality,\ngrew up in a nice family,\nhaving a good childhood\nand things coming easy,\ngood environment, but feel depressed.\nWhy?\nBecause there can be a predisposition\nor it can be a biological\nvulnerability or sensitivity\nthat it can lead to depression\nwith no obvious, obvious\ncauses or triggers or traumas\nand so on.\nIt can be a biological,\nlike anything in the body,\nincluding the brain, can at\nsome point not function well.\nSo it could be the lungs,\nit could be the pancreas\nand so on and so forth,\nand it just, there could be\na biological predisposition.\nOften, we see when we do a\ngood, careful evaluation,\nthe background, that\ndepression runs in the family\non both sides of the family.\nSo there could be some\ngenetic vulnerability\nand predisposition, and\nthen can lead to depression.\nAnd obviously if on top of that,\nthere may be a difficult childhood,\nthere could be a difficult circumstances,\npoor lifestyle, use of too\nmuch alcohol substances,\nthen it can make the\nbiological predisposition\nof vulnerability worse.\nBut a person can lead a very\ngood and a healthier life\nand still get into episodes of depression.\n- Yeah.\nThat's very interesting.\nYou mentioned the biological component,\nand while interacting with a\nPsych2Go Community, I noticed\nmany of the users were curious as to know\nwhat exactly are these\nbiological components?\nWould you like to go into\nperhaps a little more depth?\n- Yes, yes, yes.\nSo basically is regions of the brain.\nSo like the emotional region of the brain,\neven the more thinking\nregion of the brain,\nbut also the, what we call\nthe regular function region\nof the brain.\nSo that's body energy,\nsleep regulation, appetite\nand so on, there can be a disfiguration.\nIt can just not work as well.\nThey are many hypothesis\nand some scientific evidence\nthat in these regions,\nand we speak, it's very complex,\nthe brain is extremely complex,\nso that they are what we call\nneuro-transmitter networks, right?\nThe way they work together,\na dysfunction, and that can lead\nto these low mood, dark\nmood and thoughts and so on.\nWhat are neurotransmitters?\nWell, the way the brain\nfunctions now roughly\nis that there are millions\nof nerves that communicate\nwith each other.\nSo, and that's how we live,\nthat's what we live\nwith, what we experience,\nwhat we see, what we think,\nhow we move and everything.\nThe nerves communicate to\nanother nerve often by releasing\na substance, natural substance,\nthat activates or inhibits the next nerve.\nSo these are neuro-transmitters.\nAnd in depression, it\nis postulated that some\nof the system are not as well balanced.\nIt's not just one\nneurotransmitter or two or three,\nit's many of them,\nbut it has to do with the whole\nfine-tuning of the system,\nit doesn't work as well,\nand leads to some\nsymptoms of manifestation.\nIt can be depression, it\ncan be anxiety disorders\nlike have spoken about during\nthe last event together.\nSo this can be a dysregulation.\nAnd the treatments\nbiologically tend to act\non these neurotransmitters\nand the nerves and rebalance,\nand rebalance that.\nSo that's why we speak about medications\nthat may act a bit more on serotonin\nor adrenaline, adrenaline, dopamine\nand so on, and it's very complex,\nbut just to simplify, they do work.\nSo they do work, and the\nactions in these areas\nof the brain to these\nneurotransmitter system.\nWe also know from doing, for example,\nimaging studies, actually\nbeing able to see the brain\nand also see the activity of the brain,\nand so we, that before\nand after treatment,\nthere can be changes in\nthese regions of the brain.\nAnd what's interesting about\ntreatments that work well\nin people who have a\ndepression, so for example,\nmedication treatment,\npsychotherapy treatment, right?\nWhen a person gets better,\nyou do from a using\nmedication or psychotherapy,\nand there is a study done\nbefore and after treatment.\nSo before the treatment works,\nlook at the brain\nactivity and the regions,\nand remeasuring after\nthey're well to treatment,\nthere are changes.\nThe brain is different,\nbut what's also interesting is\nthat quite often, the changes\nthat are activated by\nmedication are different\nthan the changes that are\nactivated by psychotherapy.\nSo that's why sometimes\na combination is best\nbecause they don't do\nexactly the same thing\nat the same place in the brain.\n- Yeah.\nIt's very interesting.\nI've always been quite interested to learn\nabout the biological\nbasis of how that works,\nbut since we have a lot of\nquestions about social aspects\nof it, I think we'll\ntalk, we'll save that,\nwe'll put a pin on that\nand then we'll talk\nabout the social aspects.\nSo for instance,\nRochelle from YouTube has asked,\n\"How does one deal with\ndepression if they're living\n\"in a highly stressful,\nfast-paced environment\nwhen there is really no time to rest?\"\nSo really tackling the social aspect\non the bio-psycho-social model.\n- Yes.\nWell, so, yeah,\nthere's several aspects to that.\nWhen, during a depression\nit's hard to cope.\nIt's hard to cope with life's demands.\nSometimes the life is very\ndemanding, but we're well,\nand we cope with it and\nwe like it and we do well.\nDuring depression it's hard,\nand sometimes the\nenvironment is difficult,\nthe work environment is difficult,\nthe school environment or\nlife in general is difficult,\nso that's even harder during a depression.\nBut there's also how we see\nthings or we react to things,\nhow we give into protections\nto what happens to us,\nand that's when the notion\nof the locus of control\ncan be very important,\nwhich means that some\npeople tend to react a lot\nfrom the environment.\nThere are more outside-in type of people,\nand so they tend to be more\neffected by what's difficult\nin the environment.\nOther people tend or\nlearn to be more anchored\ninto themself and into a\ncalmness, into conscience,\nand they act more on life.\nSo they don't react as much,\nthey're not as sensitive to things\nthat are maybe difficult, and learning\nhow to be more from an\ninternal locus of control.\nSo the power inside, I use it\nand I live from the inside out\ncan help a lot in general and\nhelp a lot during a depression\nand help a lot in not getting depressed.\nThere's also what we call\na thinking mediation,\nwhen something happens or\nthe way we look at the world,\nthe world being more\npessimistic, coming to conclusion\nthat things will not go well,\nare not well, losing perspective\nin time or even space\nand only seeing the bad\nthing and not being able\nto see the rest of it.\nSo it's a way of\nunderstanding and processing,\nso these are cognitive processes,\nnegative cognitive sets,\nwe can say, that can\ninfluence and more and more\nthe emotions and lead to\ndepression and make it worse.\nThere's also a certain\ntype of emotionality\nif we tend to be sad and angry\nand we act a lot from\nanger rather than to learn\nto be more calm and optimistic\nor use a bit of courage,\nthe negative emotions are\nexperienced during a depression,\nbut negative emotion\nthemselves can maintain\nor worsen depression.\nSo there's the emotional aspect.\nThen there's the interpersonal aspect,\nand what like we were saying earlier,\nis that during depression,\nwe isolate the stress,\nwe might isolate, not\ncontact friends or family,\nand then suffer from that isolation,\nand that we enforces depression,\neven contributes to it.\nSo one of the ways out is to\nreach out, connect with people,\ncontinue to connect\nmore people who we trust\nand we feel good with,\nand sometime the techniques\nof interpersonal psychotherapy\nis to make these relationships better,\nmore conducive to feeling well.\nAnd so these are all the approaches\nin a sense we feeling better.\n- That's awesome.\nI think, especially these\ndays where isolation\nis unfortunately quite, fortunately\nand unfortunately quite prominent\ndue to the COVID-19 pandemic,\nit has become more and\nmore difficult to reach out\nand gain that in-person contact.\nSo do you have any advice for\nbeing able to stay connected\nfor those who don't\nreally feel as connected\nthrough the screen, for example?\n'Cause I know\nit's a quite common\nexperience amongst students.\n- Yes, yes.\nAnd it's been especially hard,\nand it's still hard now\nor during the pandemic,\nbut even to the screen,\nthat's better than not\nbeing connected at all.\nBut simple walks, getting\nout of the apartment,\ngetting out of home and\nyou'll meet people on the way,\nand now there's more\nand more possibilities\nto go back to cafe and have\nsome activities outside,\nthis is very important, very important.\nSome people during the pandemic\nhave taken the opportunity\nto reach out to dozens that they like\nthat they don't have much chance to see\nbecause when things were\nvery busy, they never...\nSo to family, to do family\nreunions, of friends,\nbecause we have at least some\ntools to connect virtually,\nwhich is something, it's important.\nJoining a group, sometime the activities,\nespecially as the\npandemic, things open up.\nBut sometime when there is\na reach-out for help, right?\nPart of the help will be\nsome group activities,\n'cause the psychotherapy\ncould also be in a group psychotherapy,\ngroup CBT, for example,\nthat can be helpful.\nBut good social contact,\nmore social contacts, that\nwill help during a depression,\nand because during a\ndepression, we do less,\nwe see less people, we're less connected,\nand that is in itself becomes a problem,\ncontributes to the depression\nbecause it's a deprivation in\na sense of social contacts.\n- Yeah.\nThat's very good to\nreinforce the main idea\nthat any contact, even\nthrough this screen,\nis better than just kind\nof closing in on oneself,\nI think, that being the message.\nAnd yeah, so that is essentially one\nof the main three questions\nthat we've received\nfrom the community about depression,\nreally focused on one's own experience.\nWe also have questions\nthat were focused more\non how a person can help\ntheir friend, for instance.\nSo before we go into those,\nI just wanted to give another\nrecap of what we've covered\nfor those that just joined in.\nSo we've talked about depression overall,\nwe've covered questions about that.\nThen we talked about more\nspecific questions sent\nfrom the community about the\nexperience of depression.\nWe are going to then talk about the ways\nthat one can support a\nfriend or a family member\nfor, who's experienced depression.\nAnd then finally, we're\ngonna talk about ways\nto optimize wellness and\nquestions sent in from the chat.\nSo if you haven't gotten the chance,\nbe sure to send questions in\nthe chat and we will get to it.\nSo with regards to the social support,\nJacks from YouTube has asked,\n\"Social support is very important,\n\"but how do you help someone\n\"that's going through depression,\n\"but their attitude is unhealthy\nfor those around them?\"\n- Yeah.\nSo first is to understand,\nwe spoke about the\nsymptoms and manifestation\nof mental depression to\nunderstand what it is.\nAnd if you suspect that\nyour friend or family member\nmay be experiencing depression,\nit's again to reach out,\nnot to push in a sense,\nbut just to reach out to see\nwhat what the problem may be,\nask how one can help,\ntry maybe to encourage more connection.\nBut then it comes at some point\nwhere it could be a serious\nand it could be urgent.\nSo especially if there is talks\nabout not enjoying life,\nthinking about dying or\neven talking about suicide,\nthen as much as possible to encourage\nto seek out for help.\nSometime it's necessary to\ntake the measures to make sure\nthat there's access to help,\ngoing to an emergency room\nand going with that person\nand a friend with to an emergency room,\nencouraging and even going physically\nand helping, because\nit can be very serious,\nthe thoughts of suicide.\nBut otherwise, it's to try to be there,\ntry to support, and also\nencourage seeking for help,\ngiving example of maybe you know somebody\nwho went through a rough time or yourself\nand did get help and was good,\nhe was helpful, point out\nwhere help may be\navailable and encouraging,\nstaying in contact, staying\nin contact because isolation\nis the worst.\n- Yeah.\nI think providing that\nkind of personal anecdote\nor the anecdote of a friend,\nif they have permission\nto do so, can be really\nhelpful to encourage a friend\nor a family member to reach out for sure.\n- Yes, and sometimes doing a bit\nof the information gathering\nof where it help to be,\nand that could be simple\nand suggest that they are ways\nand here on the phone\nnumbers or the addresses\nor where when you could reach\nout would be a good thing.\nAgain, give examples of\nothers have done that\nand were glad afterward,\nwere glad to have done that,\nto have reached out.\n- Yeah, for sure.\nWe'll definitely also be\nincluding some resources and links\nafter in the comment section\nfor those who are seeking resources,\nbut I also wanted to know,\ndo you have any recommendations\nof reliable sources\nfor people to seek out, to\nlearn more or to get help?\n- Yeah, well, it depends where one lives.\nIn many jurisdictions,\nthere are access points\nor some even official government website\nthat say, if you're in crisis,\ncall 811, or there may be a crisis line,\nor there may be a crisis\nline, a crisis team\nto help out where the\nemergency rooms may be,\nreach out to a family\nphysician, walk-in clinics,\nany of that.\nAny of that.\nIt's often as simple as googling,\nI live in search city,\nservices for depression,\nsuicide prevention, anything, anything,\nand that can lead to the\norganized healthcare system,\nand in some places quite well-organized\ndepending on the city\nand the jurisdiction.\nSo that's the first first thing to do.\n- Logistically could be\nquite difficult for minors,\nlike to kind of reach out, right?\nWithout parental permission\nand under very difficult circumstances\nwhere their parents\nmight not be supportive\nor validating their feelings\nof depression, what kind of-\n- Well, yeah, that's when, when at school,\noften they are, there may\nbe a psychologist nurse\nor just the services\ncould tell the teacher.\nIn many places, there's\nbeen a lot of sensitization\nand information about mental health\nand mental health problem,\nnow, tell a teacher,\ntell a friend and who may be able to help.\nSo that will be the way to do it.\nOf course, walking\ninto an emergency room, that's impossible.\nIt's not often that\nfeasible for a young person.\nSo it's basically teacher, friends,\nif parents are not sensitive\nenough to understand\nor may not quite know what to do,\nreach out at school.\nThat's it's often, often\noften a first good way\nof accessing help.\n- Yeah, thank you.\nI think this leads in quite\nwell to the idea of using\nthe resources you can,\nwhether that's online\nor your friends, your\nfamily, to promote wellness.\nSo I do wanna shift this\nconversation to questions\nthat we've received from the community,\nand then eventually the Intrinsic Practice\non what one can do\nto really promote that\nexperience of happiness.\nAnd so the first question that we received\nis that, what apart from\nthings like you mentioned, CBT,\nmedications, what are some\ncomplimentary medicine techniques\nfor treating or maintaining wellness?\n- Yes.\nAnd so complementary medicine,\nthere are some, we call\nmind-body approaches,\nbut there's also some\npharmacological agents.\nSo for example, there\nare some herbal compounds\nthat, like, that may be useful,\nbut it tend to be useful in a\nmild to moderate depression.\nA mind-body practices can help,\nespecially when it's a\ncompliment to treatment\nor when you don't feel so good,\nbut it's not so, it's so intense.\nSo we talk about even yoga.\nSaam acupuncture has been\nshown to have efficacy\nin the depression.\nIt was studied.\nIt was studied.\nSo all of these approaches can be useful,\nbut it comes to a point that\neven if these approaches\nare used, and especially if\ndepression is more than mild,\nbut moderate to severe,\nthen the medication\ncombination with techniques\nsuch as cognitive behavior\ntherapy or interpersonal therapy\nshould be considered.\nWe did some studies, for example,\nwith the use of mindfulness, right?\nIn different conditions, that it can help,\nbut typically it's not as effective\nas going to behavior therapy, for example.\nSo it can be helpful,\nbut would not be a first-line treatment.\nOther things that are important\nis what we call behavioral activation,\nsimple things such as trying\nto get up in the morning,\nwalk, do a bit of exercise,\nespecially early in the morning,\nsuffer, some people, a\nbit of running can be good\nfor mood and can help.\nI know it takes a lot of effort,\nbut this simple activities,\nespecially early in the morning,\ntends to activate and\nhelp in resynchronizing\nthe day/night function,\nbecause during a depression,\nthere can be a de-centralization\nof when we feel like falling\nasleep and when we get up,\nand so there is a desynchronization\nwith the natural rhythm of day and night.\nSo having a bit of activity in the morning\nand some exercise can\nhelp to resynchronize\nand eventually get back\ninto a better rhythm\nand also better mood.\n- Yeah.\nSo I think the key point\njust really to stay active,\neven when it becomes quite difficult,\nbecause I know a cardinal\nor a common symptom\nof depression is like anhedonia, right?\nSo there's less, really\nthere's less pleasure\nin day-to-day activities,\nand so it becomes really hard,\nand then it kind of, I think\nis a reinforcing cycle almost\nif they don't want to go\nout or walk, take a walk\nor do simple things, and\nthen it kind of perpetuates\nthat cycle of just...\nYeah.\nAnd so on that topic\nof promoting wellness,\na person, Eliana from Discord has asked\nabout how can you kind of\nboost one's self-esteem,\nself-confidence, self-worth,\nto maintain wellness?\n- Yes.\nSo that's a very good question.\nAnd it's part of self-knowledge\nand in a sense self-work.\nSo what does self-knowledge mean?\nWell, self-knowledge is\nknowing ourself and the way\nour body functions, our body sensations.\nIt involves also knowing what\nemotions are, the difference\nbetween negative and positive emotions\nand how to cultivate more the\npositive emotions and let go\nof the negative ones.\nIt involves knowing how to think,\nhow to think logically,\nhow to think\nin a balanced way,\noptimistically with perspective.\nSo involves doing more things\nbetter than avoiding and isolating.\nAnd then there are also\nwhat we call self-concepts.\nWhat is a self-concept?\nSelf-concept is like a hypothesis\nor an idea about ourselves,\nabout how good we may be,\nabout how bad we may be, about\nhow complete, incomplete.\nSo it could be I'm not worth of affection,\nI'm not worthy of love,\nI'm inferior, I'm incomplete,\nI don't have security.\nSo these are what we call\nnotions or self-concept,\nand through some work,\nthese can be understood,\nbecause often they are like programs\nthat work automatically in the\nbackground, being unconscious\nthat can determine our experience\nof life in relationships,\nin what we do and the way we see the world\nand see ourselves, and\nit can be quite, quite,\nquite diminishing or inhibitory\nand can lead to depression\nor to nervousness.\nSo understanding ourself\nat all these levels\nand understanding the\nself-concept, self-hypothesis,\nwe can then modify them.\nWe can modify them to some affirmation,\nto acting differently in\nsituations, to questioning ourself\nand adopting a better\nself-concept, it is doable.\nSo that's part of a therapy also.\n- Yeah.\nI really like the idea of\nmaking a hypothesis of oneself,\npreferably to test whether,\nto affirm one's, hopefully, self-esteem\nand improve that aspect.\n- Yeah.\nAnd some simple tools maybe\nalso, starting with sentences.\nI am, or I am not, right?\nSo it could be, I am\nworthy, or I am unworthy,\nor I will feel loved if I do this.\nRight?\nSo that starts to, with simple sentence,\nwe start to see how we really operate\nand whether we may see ourself\nlower than what we are,\nbecause very simply, all of\nus human beings at birth,\nwe are a full human being\nin a sense we are complete,\nand we have all the potential\nto be a full, well-functioning\nand happy human being.\nSo we are all equal in that sense.\nHowever, we may not learn\nto recognize who we are,\nrecognize our, what we call assets,\nour qualities, our talents and everything.\nWe may not learn because\nparents may not show us\nor we don't learn, right?\nSo we don't often do not see\nhow we use our potential,\nand developed some ideas of ourselves,\nwhich is lower than what we are, right?\nSo I'm not intelligent,\nor I'm not good enough,\nI'm incomplete and something's missing,\nI'm an aberration, these\nare some of the self-concept\nthat can be enough and\nunconsciously operational\nand lead our life.\nSo these, when we understand\nthem and we see them,\nthen we can start to\nformulate other concepts\nand live by them.\nIt's not easy, it's not simple,\nit means some effort at\nfirst and determination,\nbut there are tools for that.\nAnd the whole, one of the\ngoals of the Intrinsic Practice\nis to provide tools that\ncan be tried on one's own\nto modify self-concept, emotions, thoughts\nand so on and so forth.\n- Yes, that is amazing.\nI do wanna highlight for all our viewers\nthat just joined in,\nthe Toolkit Intrinsic Practice\nis a psychological wellness program,\nliteracy program toolkit\nwhere one can explore the\npage to enhance one's ability\nto experience happiness.\nThe links are in the description box below\nof the livestream, so please take a look.\nAfter we'll also get a few moments\nto chat about it after we\nanswers some of the questions\nthat we just got in from the livestream.\nSo these questions are, first\nis from Justin Adam who asks,\n\"Is mental health openly talked about\n\"among young people in Canada?\n\"I know in other countries like\nJapan, India and Indonesia,\n\"it may be more stigmatized.\"\n- Yes, yes, that's true.\nIt depends on the country,\nand it depends on also the culture,\nthe culture and how it has\nevolved in terms of openness\nand knowledge on their mental health.\nIn Canada, for example,\nthere's more and more\nknowledge about mental health\nor mental health issues,\ndepression, anxiety and others,\nso there is more and more\nalso self-disclosure of people\nwho are well-known, artists\nand even politicians\nand their experiences to a\nproblem such as a depression.\nThere are also\nsome user organizations,\npeer-to-peer support.\nThere's some groups like Youth Net,\nwhich are really suicide\nintervention and help\nby young people who do\npeer support, sensitization\nand more and more acceptance\nthat depression is a problem,\nis human problem that is important\nlike any other problem\nthat may be important.\nSo there is less and less stigma.\nBut it's true,\nit is true that it varies\nfrom one culture to another.\nRecently I've done work\nin China, in Shanghai,\nand we see there\nthat the government makes\nmental health problems\nas an important problem.\nSo it's part of the five-year plan,\nso there's more and more\nsensitization to the need\nto have support and intervene\nand have also good primary\ncare systems to address some\nof the mental health needs in\nthe country, in that culture.\nSo most countries are going\nmore and more towards openness\nand less stigma, less negative perception\nof mental illness, mental health problems.\nSo it's getting there, but it's important\nto do more activities like\nwe do to make it simple\nand make it acceptable and\ndo away with the stigma.\n- Thank you for answering that question.\nWe've actually just got\na bunch in right now,\nso we'll keep the rest pretty brief,\nbut hopefully comprehensive.\nJust Scorpy has asked,\n\"So do you recommend to\nkind of force yourself\n\"to do activities even\nwhen you don't want to\n\"in a depressive episode?\"\n- Well, forcing is a big word\nbecause it's hard to do\nactivities when depressed,\nbut starting to do a bit more,\na bit more everyday, understanding\nthat some activities, moving\nsomething every day, going out,\neven walking, connecting,\nso this call some behavioral activation,\nyes, will be useful,\nbut it's more important to do it stepwise\nin a gentle fashion than\njust pushing and pushing\nand pushing, 'cause put too much stress,\nbut planning in the morning and do a bit\nof five minutes of stretching.\nI try to go out, I try\nto walk, I try to walk,\nI try to connect pretty gently\nand add more and more and more, yes.\nBecause you want to activate,\nit's also good for the brain\nto be activated, the body,\nbut also connecting, right?\nSo to activities, going\nout, speaking to people,\nseeing people walking around, for example,\nthat can be helpful.\nSo understanding that it will be helpful\nand I do it more or everyday\nor every week and do more.\n- Awesome.\nSo one final question\nfrom the community live\nchat, that is, is from Ahmed,\nwho was asked that, \"They\nstopped their medication\n\"and they're starting to\nget some side effects.\n\"So why is it that their\nmedication stopped working\n\"after it worked in the original?\n\"And why did it get better\nafter they stopped medication\n\"even though they should\nhave stayed depressed?\"\nThat was their question.\n- Yes.\nSo it's hard to answer a\nquestion just globally like this,\nbut medication can be very useful,\nbut it has to be well\ntailored and well adjusted,\nand sometime, it has to\nbe the right fit also,\nthat's why there are many medications,\nand then being systematic\nabout using them is important.\nBut if it's medication for a one episode\nof depression, right?\nUsually it's recommended\nto take medication once one\nis well for nine months to one year.\nIf it's for recurrent\nepisodes of depression,\nmeaning somebody has experienced one, two,\nthree episodes, then\nmedication may be needed\non the long run.\nSo then it's a question of\nchoosing the right medication\nat the right dose,\nand I just think it, according\nto tolerance or side effects,\nmaybe shifting to another one,\nif it's not the good balance\nbetween a good effect\nand the side effects.\nOther rules that quite often it's good\nto start low, go slow, a low dose,\nbut know that there's\ngonna be a dose range\nto reach and to feel,\nto have more chance to feel\nwell and to the medication\nto reach maximum effect.\nAny decrease of medication,\neven if antidepressants are not medication\nthat you get a huge withdrawal from,\nwhen considering stopping medication,\nlet's say after nine months\nor a year, always with very\nslowly, very gradually.\nSo even every two weeks,\ndecreasing the dose a bit,\nand even if it's done over a few months,\nslower is better to decrease\nmedications in depressants.\n- Thank you for answering the questions\nthat were sent in from the live chat,\nand thank you so much for answer\nfor asking those questions.\nWith that, I really\nwanted to finally shift\nto our last part of the livestream\nfocusing on the value that the\nIntrinsic Practice can bring\nto enhance your experience of happiness.\nSo just as a recap, for\nthose that just joined us,\nwe talked about questions\nregarding depression in general,\nmore specific experiences of\ndepression within oneself,\nwhat you can do to help others.\nThen we talked about\nquestions that were sent in\nto the live chat as the\nstring was happening.\nI just also wanted to remind everyone\nthat this will be\navailable after our stream,\nso you can watch it at any\ntime at your convenience.\nAnd with that, let's talk a little bit\nabout the Intrinsic Practice,\nwhich viewers can find linked\nin the description box below.\nBe sure to visit intrinsicpractice.com.\nFollow them on LinkedIn,\nInstagram, all the links are below.\nSo would you like to tell us\nabout the Intrinsic Practice\nand some of the steps that one can take\nto start this program,\nand what can they expect?\n- Yes, with pleasure.\nSo the Intrinsic Practices\nis an online program\nthat is free with public\nservice type of program,\nfree, freely accessible.\nIt's basically a program or like a course\nto feel well, to be well\nand to feel better in terms\nof one's mental health.\nIt is not a treatment.\nIt's not a treatment,\nso it's not a treatment for depression,\nbut originally, the intent to develop it\nwas to help people who hadn't\ngone through a depression\nfelt better in a sense they\nhad no more of the symptoms,\nbut wanted to think more\nabout, not treatment,\nbut with wellness and\nmaintenance of wellness.\nSo we thought, let's not\ngive up the medical model,\nwhich treats illness and symptoms,\nand let get more into a wellness model,\nso, and develop tools to help\na person who was depressed\nwith anxiety problem and\ntaking medication and therapy,\nand so now, I wanna think about wellness.\nSo this is a good program\nto want to enhance wellness.\nNow, during a depression,\nit could also be useful with\none's a physician or therapist\nto consider accessing some of the tools,\nbecause the tools that are\nin the Intrinsic Practice\nare derived from psychology,\nneuroscience, psychiatry,\nsocial scientist tools as such\nor emotional tools and so on.\nSo they can also be used\nas tools in themselves\nin the context of the toolkit.\nBut otherwise, if one is interested\nin just a wellness program\nor a psychological literacy program,\nso it's a program online, as I said, free,\nthat has been organized around\nsix steps to get better,\nor to get, enhance one's\nexperience of wellness\nor of happiness.\nSo it is like a course with homework\nand with tools that can\nbe used and the templates,\nbut it's around six steps.\nSo the first step\nis how to have wellness\npractice for oneself,\nhow to do that.\nThe second one is how to define\nwhat happiness be for\noneself, because if one wants\nto be able to be happier, better\nin life is to have a notion\nof what do they think happiness is?\nIt's not gonna be my\ndefinition or your definition\nthat can be good for everybody.\nSo that's step number two.\nNumber three is about self-knowledge.\nLike we said earlier,\nself-knowledge at the body level,\nthe emotions, the thoughts, the concepts\nand so on, seven dimensions\nto know oneself better.\nStep four is knowing the world we live in\nin a sense that can be\nuseful to understanding\nhow the world can contribute to happiness.\nStep five is how to envision a happy life.\nThey're very concretely\nsituations, the situation.\nAnd step six is from our envisioning\nof how we would like to\nbe in certain situation,\nhave specific techniques for,\ncould be thought techniques,\nemotion techniques, the visualization,\nthat it be affirmation and so on,\nso for how to get there and be\nbetter and better and better\nin one's experience of life.\n- Thank you so much\nfor sharing the Intrinsic\nPractice with us all.\nThis is a self-paced\nassessable course, right?\nSo anyone can access it whenever they want\nand however, they'd like, essentially?\n- That's right, that's right.\nSo you go on the site, it's free,\nyou don't even have to register,\nso this is totally confidential.\nAnd you follow, follow the various steps,\nvarious steps with the lessons.\nSo is reading and it's often\na page is not that long.\nSo if you need to read,\nthere are many videos\nthat give explanations\nand demonstration of how to use the tool,\nand they're all less than five minutes,\nand homework to do, homework to do,\nbecause it's like a course in anything.\nIf you wanna learn a music,\nwanna learn a sports,\ngo to the class and it can be useful,\nbut a lot of it has to do with practice\nand homework and repetition.\nSo, but, so what we find\ninteresting and we're happy about\nis that it's been there with free access.\nPeople who go on it more than once,\nthere's a good 30 to 35% of\npeople who go back to the sites\nfrom 25 to 100 times.\nSo we presume that they find it useful,\nthat's why they go back to it.\nAnd the age ranges of access to the site\nare the 18 to 24, 24 to 34 in a majority.\nSo young people find it, I guess,\nthey find it useful because\nthey go back to it frequently.\n- That's amazing.\nPerhaps we can do some\nsort of session on Discord,\nwhich is discord.gg/psych2go,\nwhere we can kind\nof answer questions that people\nmight have about each step,\nand we can discuss this further to see\nhow one can really integrate\nIP into their day-to-day life.\n- Yes, yes.\nAnd with concrete examples,\nexample of how to use the tools\nand specific experiences.\nYeah, that would be a\nlittle bit to do, yeah,\nfun to do, yeah.\n- I've left the link to\nthe Intrinsic Practice,\nit's the intrinsicpractice.com,\nbut I left the link in the\ndescription box, the Instagram,\nthe LinkedIn, also in the live chat box,\nso if anyone would like, they\ncan definitely visit there.\nAlso, make sure to stay well.\nAnd thank you so much, Dr. Bradwejn,\nfor joining me today to\nanswer these questions\nthat the community has\nsent about depression.\n- Well, thank you, Monica,\nthank you, Psych2Go,\nand thank you all of you\nwho have been at this session,\nthat it's very grateful.\nThank you very much,\nand good luck, everyone.\n- Thank you do much.\nYes, thank you to Cindy,\nthank you to the whole Psych2Go team,\nand of course, thank you to our viewers\nfor joining us today.\nTogether, we can all make\npsychiatry accessible to all.\nSo have a nice day, and make sure\nto visit the Intrinsic\nPractice and all the links\nin the description box below."
