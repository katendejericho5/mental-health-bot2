    "transcript": "okay we're gonna try that again hey\neverybody we're gonna play a trailer and\nthen we're gonna begin the live\n[Music]\nare we live\nwe're live\nare you sure\noh yes you're live hey everyone lovely\npeople\nhey everybody welcome to\nour live i'm amanda silvera one of the\nvoices you hear on psych2go and today\nwe're getting to know another team\nmember\nmr thomas ken\nuh\ni have a little game plan so i'm just\ngonna review it uh so we've\nyes okay so basically for this live\nwe're gonna get to know thomas\nwe're gonna play some games\nand then we're gonna answer some\nquestions\nthat's about it so we'll start off by\nasking tommy some questions thomas who\nare you what do you do\nwell amanda thank you for asking um\nfirst of all let me just say it's\nhonored to be on the stream\nit's gonna be a good time everyone in\nthe chat hello oh i see all the haze\nflowing in\nhello hello\noh my gosh so many hi\nbeautiful\nbeautiful people hello everyone\nso um yeah as you guys know i'm thomas\nor as you guys now know i'm thomas uh\ni'm part of the psych2go team i do a\ncouple of roles here and there but\nprobably the one that you guys would be\nmost interested in is that i'm the one\nwho runs the sketchy channel and so if\nyou guys have\nif you guys don't know what the sketchy\nchannel is that's the second channel\nthat we've started\num that focuses more on animation\nillustration you know because sectogo is\nkind of a\ndyad of\ndrawings and you know education mental\nhealth education\nand you know we\nfocus a lot on the uh psychology stuff\nbut that illustration stuff is also\nreally important and so you guys have\ngiven us a lot of feedback about how you\nlove the illustration how you kind of\nwant to learn more about illustration\nanimating maybe someday be on the team\nas an animator\nand so we made this new channel uh to\naccommodate that\ndesire\nso sketchy is a illustration channel\nwhere we're going to learn and enjoy\nillustration so i run that you might\nrecognize my voice if you've seen the\nfirst video on the sketchy channel\nbecause i'm also providing the\ncommentary on there\nuh\nwhat is the what is what exactly is a\nsketchy channel it's like sketchy\npsychedel or\nyeah it's called sketchy by psych2go i\nbelieve it might be in the description\nof the stream i'm not sure if yeah\nokay\nyeah\nand so i think right there oh right\nthere on my name you should if you just\nlook that up i'm pretty sure it comes up\nuh yeah so to answer actually answer\nyour question instead of just\ntalking\num you kind of did\ni'm\nthomas i started with psych2go a bit ago\num actually the\nthe opportunity\nthat came uh\nalong that was the reason that i joined\npsych2go was because i saw a community\npost and they were like\nhey uh we need someone with this\ndisqualification to do this uh\nif anyone can help send us an email and\ni was like so\ni meet those qualifications and then\nthey responded they're like yo like\nyou know\nwe're interested and so\nthat's how that started and you know\nthat snowballed into kind of what we're\ndoing today and this is also a\ngood opportunity to remind you guys that\nthose community posts were serious man\nlike we're looking at all your comments\nwe read all your emails we uh when we\nsay like we're looking for people we we\nmean it so stay engaged on those\nyeah\nyeah\nand it's funny how the world works like\nlike\nyou you go in with the idea that you're\ngonna be doing one thing and then you\nevolve into this other thing that like\nfeeds your soul that much more\ni love that exactly exactly like you\nknow and that's those kinds of good\nvibes is what we're all about um you\nknow\nactually\nto follow up on um sorry to just finish\nmy introduction uh\na little more about myself uh\nit's all about you we want to know\neverything oh i'm flattered\ni have seen a lot of comments um every\ntime my name is mentioned in the\ncommunity post asking if i'm korean\nfirst of all yes i'm korean\num actually one of the roles initial\nroles that i was brought on to\nto do was to help out with the korean\nchannel you guys can find that at\npsych2go\nkr i believe is the link\nuh\nso i was brought along to help with that\ni'm also a very big fan of digital media\nand psychology which is the reason why i\nkind of discovered psych2go in the first\nplace um my hobbies include drawing\nobviously\num exercising and singing and i believe\nyou think yeah yeah but i mean like you\nknow as a hobby\noh yeah\nyeah yes as you guys know amanda has the\ngolden voice the\npsych2go representative golden voice and\nso it's an honor to even be in her\npresence right now very very if you guys\nwant to see me\nyou guys want to see me singing you can\nsee that in the description i mostly do\num\nkorean covers of english songs and\nenglish covers of korean songs\nso if you guys if that sounds like\nsomething you're interested in then you\ncan check that out i'm checking that for\nsure\nthank you so that is enough about me um\namanda for the people who perhaps joined\na little bit late perhaps um\nyou want to run down what we're doing\nagain today\nyeah okay so we're getting to know\nanother member of our team thomas\nwe're\ntalking about the sketchy channel and\nhow it has it's grown so quickly\num we're going to give you a little\nsneak peek of one of the videos in a\nlittle bit\nwe're gonna play some games and then\nwe're gonna answer some of your\nquestions\nso that's the game plan for today\num i think\nlike what is the channel looking like\nright now like how long has it existed\nand what how many\nhow many subscribers do we have already\nthat is a good question and a very good\nopportunity for me to flex um\nright it's not my flex it's it's the\nteam flex and our flight\nyeah yeah it's astounding the reaction\nthat you guys have given all the love\nthat you guys have given has amassed\naround 10k subscribers uh within this\npast week that the channel's been alive\nthe first video and there's\nthere's only one video sorry it hasn't\neven been a week by the way there's only\none video there's the next video is\nprobably coming out either tomorrow or\nthe next day\nhas amassed i think 50k views which is\ninsane\num and so\ndo you ever think about just like how\nmany humans that is i know right like if\ni had them all in a room i'd like\ncan't even tell their faces like we're\nnot comprehend\nyeah but know that even though that is\ntrue i appreciate every single one of\nyou so\nyeah definitely i always try to make i\nalways try to like really think about\nlike the fact that\nthese are like\nlike this is all this is people this is\nindividual people that are amassing to\nthis number and it's like\nit's really cool i feel like on youtube\nand on internet in general once you\nstart kind of interacting with\ngroups of people instead of just\nindividual like you know messages or\ncomments it gets a little hard to\nremember that personally i know\nit's always still a humbling experience\nand like\none of the\nbetter skills that i've learned over\nthis past week alone is to really just\nappreciate every single individual and\nso actually on the sketchy video every\nsingle comment i've been reading pretty\nmuch every single one of them um i\nhaven't been able to respond to all of\nthem just because there's so much but\ni've been reading every single one of\nthem and you got your guys supports and\nyour guys's warm words just mean the\nworld to not only me but our entire team\nthat worked so hard to make all this\npossible\ndefinitely\nmy heart my heart is feeling thing\ni'm a soft heart\nah i'm uh yeah i'm i'm very sen i'm an\nhsp what can i say\nuh well let's let's throw a little\npreview of the\nfirst video or the second\nfirst video right\nactually um maybe just for the people\nwho have come into the stream late why\ndon't we play the trailer and then the\nfirst video\nyeah just a little preview of the first\nvideo but\nsounds good okay i'm not even sure yeah\ni did play earlier i was confused i was\nseeing how long we had been on the live\nand i was like\nwhat's happening i'm still new to this\nwe're very very new to this yeah we're\nwe're pretty much uh\nwe're new so\nyeah\nokay uh okay i'm gonna play the trailer\nand then i'm gonna right after that i'm\ngonna play the first video if you guys\nhaven't seen it already so\nthree two\none\n[Music]\nhow do i draw cute characters well cute\naesthetically is when things generally\nresemble babies\nbabies this is hardcoded into our dna or\nelse we hate babies and that is a very\npoor evolutionary strategy for the\nperpetuation of our species so why is it\nsometimes harder to make your drawings\ncuter or another perhaps even more\nrelevant question why are my cute\ndrawings not as good as i want them to\nbe you see they're being\noh my god we're not going to find out\nunless you watch the video\ni want you looking for me\nwe all want more that's funny\nyeah very good job\nvery good job\nuh that was actually really interesting\nand yeah i didn't know what to expect i\nthought you were going to be like i\nthought it was going to be like one of\nthose like drawing videos where you just\nwatched someone draw\nbut that one like peaked my attention\ni like that\nthere's definitely going to be um maybe\nvideos like that maybe if people want it\num\ni'm not so sure people would want that i\ni'm not gonna do it\nyeah but for now exactly so guys you\nknow feedback is appreciated um\nyeah for sure\nknow what you like what you want\nuh so in\nin making these first two projects what\ndo you feel like were your biggest like\nhurdles like you\nlove what you do\nbut of course there are sides of it that\nmay be kind of tedious or frustrating\nwhat were they and how did you overcome\nthem\num well\nthis goes for any\nproject in which i'm making myself\nvulnerable on the internet i suppose or\nto the public\num but\ngetting over\nthe fear of like\nare people good\nand i know it's a little bit unfounded\nbut just like oh my god are people going\nto hate me like\noh this is afraid\ni read my personal journals out to the\nworld on my personal channel like i feel\nyou i had to stop for a while because\nlike when you put yourself out there\nlike that like it really does take a\ntoll on you\nand so that kind of emotional investment\nand emotional tool even though it's\ni mean to the audience that video that i\nthat we just saw was very like i suppose\non the more rational objective side it's\nvery just like clinical but like to me\nit's it's a product of kind of my\npassions and so that's\nmaking myself vulnerable in a way that\num\nis like irrevocable and so\nthat kind of insecurity gripped me a lot\nin the actual\nplanning stage and so making the thing\nitself\non a technical level on a mechanical\nlevel was not\ndifficult i didn't really i wouldn't say\nthat i encountered difficulties there\nper se but just the kind of conceptual\nmental\naspect of it was um\npretty difficult and i think\nand obviously amanda i'm very validated\nby\nyour um ability to relate to that even\nthough i'm\ni'm sorry to hear that\nyeah\nit's yeah well yeah but you you\ni feel like you grow every time you\nbecause there are certain there's\ncertain fears that you\nyou\nyou know you'll benefit from if you face\nthem like you know if you like this live\nthis life was terrifying for both of us\nbut here we are we're doing it and we're\nsurviving and when i just can't see it\nbut like my desks are like vibrating i\nmean my legs aren't vibrating under my\ndesk see i i said my desk is vibrating\nthat's how nervous i am\nyeah\nbut after we're going to feel like we\naccomplished something and and we're\ngoing to be on cloud 9 for the rest of\nthe day\nso\nthat being said speaking of cloud 9 i'm\non cloud 9 because desiree\ngeyser has donated five dollars sorry if\ni mispronounce your name thank you so\nmuch desiree thank you thank you i need\nto come back to the chat i need to see\nwhat's going on\nuh okay\nactually the comments oh there's a lot\nof comments we're gonna get there uh oh\nokay so one of the questions before we\nthe questions are later but one of the\nquestions in every live that i see\nand even in the comments is\nwhat is your mbti type and we talked\nabout this yesterday as we were prepping\nfor the live and i never know what it is\nbecause i feel like for some reason it\nchanges every time i take the test\nbut a lot of people assumed for a while\nthat i was infj and i kind of want it to\nbe because it's rare and i'm a weirdo\nand i'm like it wouldn't be the rare\nthing i would be quirky\ni wanted ricky but so i did the test i\nfound out what i am do you know what you\nare\nyep\nokay\nso what are you\noh i'm going first all right well let me\nget some context because if i just say\nit i'm gonna\nif i just say\nit it'll it'll be worse so\ni have taken this test multiple times\njust because it's really fun and i\nalways make my friends do it and so to\nmake them feel\ni don't want to just like sit there\nwhile they're like doing it so i do it\nalong with them yeah\nevery single time i have rotated between\ni and f j and i and f t sorry i t i n t\nj i n t j and i infj\num everything else is like i n and j are\nlike completely like seventy percent\neighty percent\nf and t are like fifty\nfifty point five and like forty nine\npoint five yet it's like\nreally close all the time\nbut consistently for the past like three\ntests even though that is true it's been\ncloser to the f side so\ni guess technically i'm an infj\num\nand i don't know\nwell at the same time it's like\ni don't know you know\nit's just\nthey're all special though it's one test\nand it's also a binary which is like you\nknow even though i'm like 51 f i'm\nlooped in that entire f category with\npeople who are also like 80 percent off\nso i saw someone ask do you have a which\nsite do you use to take the test\ni don't want to throw out endorsements\nwithout the approval right right right\nif you google the mbti test i usually\npick not the first one but the second\none oh\nyou're you're an indie girl huh\nwhy i wanted iron\nlooking something up on google and\nselecting the second result oh man\nwell yeah because like the first one i\nfeel like is like too commercial\ni don't know\nlike would align with this way of\nthinking i am i n f p\nt\ni'm always turbulent i'm never not to\nyou same thing\num and then i just say yesterday what\nsorry can i just say that was a that was\na brilliant segway\ni don't know\nlike i feel like my personality type\nleads to that and that being said i am\nyou maybe there's like a natural\nwhat no i don't know what i was gonna\nsay i ruined it i just got awkward again\nyou have a knack for it that's your\nthat's your uh infp\nokay um\ni guess we could well okay\nlet's play would you rather and then you\nguys\nwe're gonna play feel free to play like\nto to play would you rather in the\ncomments as well but also feel free to\nsuggest them would you rather for us to\nanswer\nand\nand we'll pick some\nso\nuh the first would you rather these are\nkind of silly like they're very basic\nthey're not too too deep the first one i\nhave here is would you rather be a\ngenius and know everything or\nbe amazing at any activity you tried\nso i already know that like immediately\nwhy don't you go first because i'm gonna\nthink about it for a second you gotta\nthink about it\ni\ni wanna be amazing at every activity\nthat just seems like it would be really\nfun or boring because then you don't get\nto like\nlearn and learning can be fun too my\nthing is if i'm a genius and i know\neverything to me that's kind of like\nmy whole thing is i like learning\nbut i do love like when people are like\noh beginner's luck and i'm like i don't\nknow maybe\ni'm just good\nuh yeah so i feel like i would i don't\nwant to be a genius to know everything\nmaybe like right before i die that might\nbe that might be cool but like not now\ni want to learn i want to expand i want\nroom to grow\nwhat do i feel i feel yeah i've heard a\nlot of friends say that when i've asked\nsimilar questions they're like i value\nthe process of like actually grinding to\nlike get good at it\num before i answer let me just say that\nthe chat is like overwhelmingly voting\nfor be amazing at everything it appears\ni've only seen one person say genius and\nso i i guess\nand just in terms of practicality i\nsuppose being amazing at everything\nwould be like the good one just because\ni can like go to the olympics\noh my gosh i didn't think about all of\nthose things that we could do right\nunless we could cook anything we wanted\nlike all the dishes just like bam\ngourmet\nso but then if you're a genius then you\ncan like contribute to like society at\nlarge\nthree phds and like\nif you're a genius you could like\nattack climate change and like make the\nworld a better\nfriend so it's like it's like pro-social\nor like yourself but in the end\nlike you know i'm i feel like i'm always\ngonna be pro-social as opposed to\nmyself this is very hard i thought they\nwere going to be easy\noh yeah i just thought of that on this\nphone i was like oh that makes it harder\nfor myself i don't know why i brought\nthat up but you know what all things\nconsidered probably amazing in any\nactivity just because\ni've always had this complex about like\nnot\neverywhere i go i'm like pretty decently\nokay at stuff but then i'm never like\nthe best yeah i just really want to know\nwhat it is\nthat's something we're not the best yeah\nbut you know what i don't think anyone\never really feels like they're the best\neven when they are\ni just i don't i don't know that we're\nreally built that way\neven when you are the possible going to\nbe a part of you that's like but i can\nbe better\nand maybe that's what makes them best\nthat uh that grind set\nprobably\nprobably\nall right\nnext up\nwhen i read this i okay i'm gonna tell\nyou what i thought it said and then i'm\ngonna say what it actually\nwould you i thought it said would you\nrather die alone or watch a movie by\nyourself and i was like well\nwhat's wrong with watching a movie by\nyourself like why is that the comparison\nhere it's like would you rather like\nget your clothes wet or like have a\ncookie\nthat's\nwhat\nokay i\nokay but what it actually says i'm\ncrying i have a tear in my eye\nwhat it actually says is would you\nrather dine\nyour food alone\num or watch a movie by yourself me\npersonally i have no problem doing\nthings by myself i love going and eating\nby myself and i would definitely if new\nmovie theaters were open i would go by\nmyself for sure\nso i don't know\ni i feel you um and so to this\nto me this red as like what would you\nlike better like you have two good\noptions but you can only choose one\nso\nso choosing one is actually an\nopportunity cost for me i am like\nextremely introverted and so i'd rather\ndo these things\nyeah exactly so\nthis question has become would i rather\nget free food or would i rather get a\nfree movie why would you give me food if\nyou dine alone oh shoot then i have to\npay for it yeah\nyeah okay okay this changes things\nbut you still get food it's just not\nfree\nyou could also give food in a movie\ntheater\noh yeah\nbut\ni would rather i think i would rather\ndine alone because like i like listening\nto like\npeople talk like yes it's eavesdropping\nbut i'm not like doing it in it\napparently listening to people talk\nduring the movie\nno people don't talk really during\nmovies that's why i would rather eat at\na restaurant and like\nother people's vibes like i love like\nsitting next to like a happy group of\npeople or like a family gathering and\nhearing like laughter and like you know\nlike\ni like i don't want to be at the table\nwith everyone that's a bit much but i\nlike hearing and feeling the joy i can\nfeel it just from like a table away so i\ni think that's what i choose that's a\nvery sweet wholesome answer and now i\nfeel ashamed of my answer just being\nlike i want to eat food\ni mean\nthat's fair too though that's true\nmy therapist is trying to like get me to\nlike really think about like\nwhen you do something is it because you\nwant to or is it because you feel you\nhave to\nso i'm really kind of keeping that in\nmind with everything that i do over the\npast week like\ndo i feel like i'm doing this to make\nsomeone else happy do i feel like you\nknow or\nis this feeding my soul is this what i\nwant to do so even like when it's like\ncoming down to like giving the right\nanswer it's like\ni'm really just trying to see like hello\nsoul\nwhat's your answer instead of like what\ndo they want to hear i feel that i feel\nlike practicing\njust\ntruth speech like speech that is true to\nyourself not like saying things because\nyou feel like you should instead of like\nsaying things that you know are true or\nto yourself yeah good habit in general\nthat's why\ni've seen people give advice that's like\ni know everything is hard and everybody\nhas difficulties and like for sure\nprobably whatever you're going through\nis like\ntotally like understandably\ndifficult and heart-wrenching but\ntry not complaining just for a bit see\nhow far that takes you and that that\nyeah one day a little bit\nno complaint only gratitude\nthat's just that's a powerful practice\nactually of course there's always gonna\nbe something to complain about but\ntrying for one day to not speak that\nenergy to not put that energy out\nyeah i should\ni feel like i could probably do that\ntoday i don't think i've complained yet\ni probably have maybe i'll start fresh\ntomorrow okay\nnext\nwould you rather be the richest person\nin the world or be immortal\nokay when\nthis and i'm the most like frustrating\nperson to play would you rather with\nbecause i always like have to know all\nthe conditions and stuff i know portal\ndo you mean like i can't die i'm\nimpervious to any damage or i just can't\ndie of old age but i can like i will i\nwill also disintegrate with the heat\ndeath of the universe\nlike a vampire yeah yeah\nyeah\ni always just assume it's like a vampire\ni got a thing for vampire i yeah i feel\nlike i feel like whenever i hear a\nmortal i'm like oh like a vampire\num\nyeah i don't know i don't know i don't\nknow if i want to be immortal gosh like\ni've got depression i i go through my\ncycles and there are times where i'm\nlike well i don't wanna immortality\nsounds like a curse\nbut um\nthe richest person in the world also\ni guess i would pick that as long as i\ncould keep my heart and like be me\nand like the money\nit's dangerous having that kind of money\nis dangerous especially if you want to\nlike\ngo against all of the other rich people\nin the world\nlike you should probably also be\nimmortal in order\nrichest person in the world\nso yeah for the people who missed it the\nquestion is would you rather be immortal\nor\nthe richest person in the world um i\ni would probably also choose richard's\npersonal i mean like being able to die\nis like what makes life sweet you know\ni agree\ni agree\nokay this that question i feel like\ncould go on forever so\num\nyou guys\ni have one question left here and then\ni'm gonna scroll through and see if you\nhave any suggestions for would you\nrather so keep them coming\nuh would you rather wear\npants three sizes too big or shoes three\nsizes too small obviously pants\nwhat\nof course you're gonna wear pants three\nsizes too big as opposed to shoes three\nsizes too small that would hurt but\neveryone wears i mean not everyone but\nlike i rock baggy pants all the time\nthree sizes though\nyou can you can you can make it work\nwith the right attitude\nthe attitude fills the gap yeah\nhow did you feel the three sizes\ni feel i feel i mean we're all working\nfrom home anyway so we just sit down\nyeah\npajamas all that matters is the design\nof the pants at that point so i'm with\nyou\nyeah my grandma always said um\ni forget what she said so i'm gonna\nbutcher it but she said something about\nthe importance of wearing comfortable\nshoes\nbecause your feet carry your whole body\nand if your feet aren't happy then the\nrest of you won't be happy that's true\nhow many thousand movements a day and\nyeah that matters the most in your day\nor not the big events but the little\nthings you do every day\nrepetitively\nhave you ever had reflexology on your\nfeet\nno that sounds terrifying\noh what no it's amazing\ni got it\ni got it i got it and it was crazy\ncertain parts of your feet are supposed\nto be connected to different parts of\nyour body and like\nit was it was an experience\ni feel like i was detoxified i felt like\nthere were certain areas that were very\nvery tender which kind of represented\ndifferent parts of my body that were not\nso happy\nand you're you're supposed to drink a\nbunch of water after because it is\nsupposed to really detox you but it's\nall it's like a foot massage but not\nalways comfortable so like they press\none part and they're like yeah you're\nthis part is also going to start feeling\nbetter now or like\nwow\nyou're going to start seeing aliens now\nlike\ni mean i wish they pushed that part i'm\nright\num\nyeah anyways enough about feet loki i\nactually really don't like feet so we\ncan stop talking about that\nokay uh let's see\nuh\nwould you\nwould you rather\ny'all have some dark witch or others\ni've seen a lot of death ones\ni can't not laugh\nsomething about the word muffin that\nreally gets me going um\nwould you rather mistake children for\nmuffins or mistake muffins for children\nme\nhelp\nyou know i never thought i'd um become\nspeechless that i would be rather prompt\nbut\ntoday you know i'm having a lot of\ndifferent new experiences\ni'm just trying to figure out i don't\nknow what i'm seeing in my head i'm\ni suppose the implication here is that\nyou're eating baby\nyeah either way\neither way i mean\ni've had maybe i read the wrong one i\ndon't know i can't choose\ni'll answer it but then you were like\nlet's bypass it i was like yeah yeah\nlet's bypass it\nwhichever whichever answer um\navoids the children being harmed is the\none i choose but i don't think either of\nthose\nare answers would you rather be a\nwerewolf or a vampire\nwerewolf is very intrusive in like your\ndaily life i feel like\nyou're just like in a meeting you're\ndoing a live stream you're like\nyeah that would be that'd be amazing\nthough can you imagine a live stream\nwhere someone just like turns into\nplease and something\nit would be way funnier if the\ntransition was slow\nbecause like\nat the beginning they're normal and like\nslowly they gradually become a wolf by\nthe end of me you're like am i i'm not\nsure if i'm what am i is this happening\nam i\nwhat did i okay uh i would choose\nvampire just because i just think\nthey're very cool and remember i told\nyou i learned how to\nget it sucked i'm jamaican i want my\njamaican accent back but i was made fun\nof my accent as a child so i studied\nbuffy the vampire slayer really like\nreligiously\nto sound like her i don't sound like her\nnow\nbuffy but\num still obsessed with the show it's\nlike my comfort\nmy comfort\nseries\nespecially this time of year coming into\nseptember i can't wait to just\nhave it playing and have some like nice\ncandles uh it's gonna be a vibe\nit's a vampire for sure and i feel like\nbased on what you said you're you're\nteam vampire too as opposed to normal\nit's the last two evils\ni can't get over the muffins\nokay would you rather be\nfast but not smart or smart but slow\nlike physically fast like\nhow fast we talking\nyeah right like superhuman fast i feel\nlike i'm already\nkind of smart and slow\nphysically don't you want a new\nperspective though\nyes\nbut i

i'll ask you some questions\ntoo\nthe vacuum is getting closer\ni just like to\npoint out a comment that said thomas's\nhair sticking out through his hat makes\nhim look like a rooster\noh amazing we love rippers we love that\nfor you\nthat's uh that's cute i should i should\nmake like the sketchy character have\nlike a rooster affinity\nyou know how ah man i don't know how\nmany\nhow many of you

like\nchickens\ni should like i should make loki i\nshould make sketchy like\nbe represented by like a rooster mascot\nbut anyways yeah i mean yeah\nthat would be a cute story\nyour first live and someone commented it\nand then it turned into a character oh\nmy god i'm a rooster and i'm eating the\nhot chicken ramen\nyes it's all connected it's all coming\ntogether now\num what is our myers-briggs personality\ntype so actually we answered this at the\nbeginning of the stream um i'm an infj t\nand amanda\ni am an infpt\ni am thirsty thank you\nyeah i need some more water too\nsomeone asked if there is a specific age\nneeded to join the psych2go team i don't\ni don't have\ni believe we have some people working\nwith psych2go that are\nof a lower age than you'd think so i\nwould say don't let that stop you\nyeah you might as well try and see what\nhappens\num\nthomas the rooster is eating his brother\nyeah pretty much\nwhat are you drinking chicken water\nwhat is happening\ni wouldn't i wouldn't be opposed to that\nthat's uh isn't that protein\na lot of things are protein um\nso chicken wing hot oh\nchicken wing chicken\nyes we have merch if you um look at the\ncommunity post we've actually been\nmaking a few posts about uh our plushies\ni believe we have shirts too\ni want a plushie so bad i need to order\none it's so cute i want a really big one\nmassive one\nugh one day one day hopefully we make\nlike really really big ones is our\nmascot's name pronounced psy or psi\ni'm british it's psy yeah it's psy like\npsychology\nbut with the night i see it i see it in\nall caps\nso like it's like oh like the the\npressure\nmeasurement unit\nyou know it's interesting like there's\nso many things like names that we read\non the internet where we never actually\nlike say them out loud so when it comes\ntime to actually say it out loud it's\nlike\nyou don't want to say it because you\njust don't know\ni feel so hard on that when i was\nlearning english i i read a lot right i\ndidn't really hear people speak i i read\na lot\nyeah korean's a phonetic language so you\nknow how things are pronounced as soon\nas you see it but english is not\nobviously as we all know so when i would\nread things and then i pronounced\neverything wrong people and then people\nwould make fun of me\nhonestly people making fun of people\nlike speaking in additional language\nlike it's like how many languages you\nspeak the people that make fun of you\nare the ones that can only speak one\nlanguage\nthat's true\nit's so just for the people who have\ncome to the live stream just now or a\nlittle bit later this stream is to\npromote and announce our second channel\nwell not our second channel our\nadditional channel uh sketchy by\npsych2go which you can see i believe\nright here um if you look that up it's\nprobably going to show up it's also in\nthe description i believe uh it's the\nchannel where we focus more on the\nanimation illustration aspect of\npsych2go it's hosted by me\num\napparently i've promised to do a spicy\nramen challenge at 50k subscribers so if\nyou want to see that oh amanda we're\ngonna do it together 50k\nnow we're gonna do it\num there was a question someone asked if\ndraw psy is a duck a psyduck\num you know what you you know how to uh\nyou know how to get a man going because\ni love pokemon so you know what i will\ndo that you'll\nmaybe you'll see that on that one\nand five three eight two suggestion\num that will be coming yeah as soon as\nsketchy doesn't have a community page\nyet um that takes a few days for youtube\nto process but as soon as it does i'll\nmake the first post a psyduck\namazing i'm excited\num somebody asked if they need to use\ntheir real name to work for spectacle um\ni no you don't you can use an alias if\nyou'd like to if you'd like to remain\nanonymous i\ni can almost guarantee that that's fine\n[Music]\ngood vibes whose birthday is it today\nis also my birthday happy birthday sims\nrock99\noh yeah i saw a lot of people on the\ncommunity post being like um\noh like that's my birthday or that's the\nday that i returned to school how's\nschool by the way if anyone's returned\nfrom school i believe some people\nstarted school today because it's\nseptember\noh yeah\nman\nhow is that and that's back like in the\nschool as opposed to\nhome school right is it i suppose it's\nby a region but it is by region i would\nassume yeah\nit's then\nfrom where i live it always starts the\nday after labor day so\nthat's that's kind of new to me that\npeople are starting school like straight\nup september\nyeah you know what's weird it i went for\ni woke up at 4 a.m today for no reason\nthis has happened today and yesterday 4\na.m\ndon't know why\num and instead of like tossing and\nturning ending why\ni got up and i went for a while\nand it was so cold\ni was like what when did this happen and\nit was so dark at like five six a.m like\nsummer's over\nit went by so quickly\nearth straight up just knows it's like\naugust no we can we can't we can't and\nit's oh yeah it went cold earth was like\nokay it's september\nit's four am sean\nwow\nthanks for thanks for staying up to\nthe vibe out with us\ni have online learning lockdown do you\nprefer homeschooling or do you do you\nwant to go back to school guys girls\nhumans\nuh ronnie latte said i like amanda's\nvoice because when i watch like to go\nvids i feel like i'm taking meditation\nkeep going love you from indonesia thank\nyou\nthank you\ni'm so glad we love indonesia\ni also have a personal channel if any of\nyou guys are interested where as i\nmentioned i read\nmy journal entries my poems i share my\nmusic and um and also i read your\nsubmissions too so i have people send me\nstories and i read them out i also have\nlike a little bit of um\na free audio book we talked about that\nyesterday too i have accents in that one\nand i also try to sound\ntry to sound like a man and for some\ncharacters i had to stop because i just\ncouldn't make any more voices for any\nmore characters but anyways\nso that is just youtube.com amanda\nsilvera that should be in the\ndescription as well if you can't get\nenough of amanda\nyou're getting a therapist oh thank you\nsomebody said they're getting a\ntherapist and i want to say\ncongratulations because that's huge once\nyou find a therapist that\num that you're comfortable with that's\nthe thing for so long i was anti-therapy\nbecause when i was a kid\ni had some therapy sessions and i just i\nfelt like i was being talked down to i\ndidn't feel understood i was just like i\nhate this and all of my walls went up\nand i was like i don't do this anymore\num\nbut\ni have a new one and this is the first\ntime in so many years and i love her i\nlove her so much she\nwe speak the same language and she just\nkind of helps me when i'm starting to\nkind of\nthink negative thoughts or have\nintrusive thoughts and stuff like that\num\nshe reminds me of why that's happening\nand how to kind of reprogram it's just\nit's just been so helpful to have a\nhealthy check-in once a week so for\nanyone who has started therapy or is\nopen to to trying therapy i just want to\nsay that's very brave of you and keep\ntrying until you find the right fit\nbecause when you find the right fit\nit just\nchanges everything it really really\nreally helps\nso that's my piece on that yeah i think\nit's really important to know that um\ntherapy not all therapists are like the\nsame like you could very well vibe with\none therapist and one might\nnot be the best\nfor you and so i wouldn't write off um\nthis is for people that are considering\ntherapy but are hesitant but i wouldn't\ni wouldn't write off any\ni suppose tangible method to deal with\nmental health struggles just because\nyou've had a bad experience with them\nbecause\nnot to invalidate your experience\nobviously but it very well could have\nbeen um an a different factor that was\naffecting your experience so\nyeah\nyeah\nit's tough it's good that um some people\nare saying that this channel is their\ntherapy and things like that and there\nare all sorts of different forms of\ntherapy it doesn't have to be one-on-one\nor talking to a person and therapy can\nbe pretty expensive i'm actually working\nwith an intern therapist so it's a\nlittle bit\nlower\non the scale as far as like\ninvestment what i have to pay\nand\nthe cool thing about that is when you're\nworking with an intern\nthey've just come out of school they're\nstill passionate they're not some\ntherapists get burnt out they're human\nso\nas they've been doing it for like years\nand years and years sometimes they might\nkind of just\nnumb out or something i don't know but\nshe's new and she's young and\nwe we have the same kind of experiences\nand stuff so that's the cool thing about\nan intern it's cheaper and it might be\nsomeone that's closer to your age or\nsomeone that you can actually relate to\nso that's also an option when you're\nshopping for a therapist\nyeah um in the comments i've been seeing\na lot this goes for the sketchy comments\ntoo but in the chat comments right now\ni've seen the question a lot of what\nprogram do i use and what um equipment\ndo i use for illustration and animation\ni should take this opportunity to\nmention um there are multiple animators\nfor psych2go which is why sometimes\nyou'll see different art styles there's\nnot just one um\nand so to say that uh\nso i've seen a lot of people seeing me\nand they're like oh i'm so glad to see\nwho the animator is i'm not i'm not\nthat uh that phrasing is not exactly\ncorrect um\nas for illustration\ni don't want to um\nlike\ni'm hesitant about just like saying i\nuse this and then people just go in and\nspending more money on a program just\nbecause like i use it and though oh that\nmeans he recommends it i'm going to use\nit um so\nwhen you're looking for a program to\ndraw with or illustrate with or animate\nwith please do your research um and keep\nyour budget in mind uh and your goals in\nmind your the illustration program that\nyou choose is always going to differ\ndepending on what program uh sorry what\nyour goal is your long-term goal is if\nyou're only going to make illustrations\nthen there's programs for that if you\nwant to focus more on animations um\nthere's programs for that there's kind\nof a succession of like you know like\nbeginner programs intermediate programs\nmore advanced programs\nand there's better\nflows\nlike paths i'll say um for certain ones\nfor example um\nif you want to go into animation but you\nalso want to do learn a lot of things\nabout illustration perhaps you might\nconsider uh photoshop for drawing and\nthen moving into adobe animate for\nanimation because they're both adobe\nthey'll be coherent with each other um\na lot of the short keyboard shortcuts\nwill be the same a lot of the files will\nbe compatible with each other so you can\ndo that if you're looking more for\nillustration if you want kind of um\nmore like just like to go style\nanimations instead of like rigged\nanimations if you don't know what rigged\nanimations is don't don't worry about it\ntoo much um if you want to go for more\nlike psych2go kind of animations where\nit's like a picture to the next picture\nto the next picture you may want to go\nwith something more simple like toon\nboom or\nif you want to focus more on\nillustrations making your drawings look\npretty brushes\nuh i could recommend clip studio i'm not\ngoing to officially it might be a good\nvideo to make like your top\nrecommendations and so that is actually\nprobably going to be the subject of a\nfew videos like i plan on having a lot\nof q and a's on sketchy to be able to\nanswer guys questions in thorough detail\nto answer the\ninitial question i personally am right\nnow at the moment using clip studio\npaint i sometimes use photoshop too\nwell\nwhat a question i can't remember my\nphone or my phone the computer's about\nto test let me just grab my charger\nwe've got almost i think just less than\n10 minutes\noh yep\nand so while amanda is\nover there and unintelligible\nperhaps i will take this opportunity to\nplug my personal channel again so i do\nrun sketchy and i am part of the\npsych2go team i also run a personal\nchannel where i post um covers\nuh\nsong covers they're not super\nprofessional or anything but\num\ni like to typically write new korean\nlyrics for english songs and english\nlyrics for korean songs if that sounds\nlike something you guys would like to\nsee then you can hop on over to my\nchannel it's in the description i\nbelieve um and i also take suggestions\nif you want to see a korean song\ntranslated into english and some then\nmaybe i'll\ntake a crack at it but yeah if that\nsounds like something that interests you\nyou should check it out\nthat was a cool voice there\num\ni'm okay\npro quo it's pretty good yeah it is\npretty good um\ni don't i don't actually know too much\nabout procreate i know the brushes are\nreally good the brushes are really\npretty um but i don't know if there's a\npc version so you'll be doing that on\nyou'll be doing most of your work on\ntablet\ncan you charge like can you translate\nkpop\nyes i am fluent in korean\nyes you can\num\nseeing as i am korean i\nhe is korean\nuh okay\ni feel like\nwe can wrap it up now\nif you wanna if you to get a quick\nquestion in feel free i do have one\nthing i would like to mention for\ntomorrow there is\nthere is another live i'm sorry i bet\nyou can't hear the trucks but they're so\ndistracting to me
