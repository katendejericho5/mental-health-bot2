back.\nHave your parents ever told you something\nthat to this day still hurts\nevery time you think about it?\nThough we might not always be aware of it,\nour words hold so much\nmore power than we realize.\nThis is even more important\nin familial relationships.\nStudies of child psychology have shown\nthat the way our parents talk to us\nbecomes the way we learn\nto talk to ourselves.\nSo the way parents talk to their children\ncould have serious repercussions\non their self concept, self esteem,\nand emotional attachment\nto others even as adults.\nWith that said, here are eight\nof the most damaging things\na parent can say to their child.\nNumber one, \"What's the matter with you?\"\nIf your child's personality\noften clashes with yours,\nit can be difficult to\nbe around them so much,\nlet alone to parent them.\nBut no matter how frustrated we might get,\nit's important to always\nkeep our temper in check\nand stop ourselves from letting\nour anger get the best of us.\nAsking your child what's\nthe matter with them\njust because they don't share\nthe same interests as you\nor act the way you think they should\nis only going to hurt their self esteem\nand make them question their\nown sense of self worth.\nNumber two, \"I don't have\ntime for you right now.\"\nWe all know that taking care of a child\nis no easy task, even\nwith a co parent around.\nAnd having to balance a full time job\nalong with it can be overwhelming.\nSo it's important that you\nkeep your priorities in check\nwhen making compromises between\nyour work life and your family life.\nAnd if you really have to choose\nthe former over the latter sometimes,\ndon't just simply tell your child\nthat you don't have time for them\nor that you can't deal\nwith them right now.\nExplain it to them in a way\nthat won't hurt their feelings\nand make it up to them\nsome other time or way.\nOtherwise they'll start to\nfeel lonely and neglected.\nNumber three, \"I wish\nyou were more like this.\"\nJust as we should refrain from\ncomparing ourselves to others,\nparents should never\ncompare their children\nwith their siblings or classmates.\nNot only does this breed\ninsecurity, rivalry, and jealousy,\nit also makes them feel like\nthey're not good enough for you\nand that the love you have\nfor them needs to be earned.\nFor example, saying,\n\"Why can't you be more like\nyour straight A friend?\"\nmakes them feel like you\ncare more about their grades\nthan you do about them, which\nbrings us to our next point.\nNumber four, \"You're a\ndisappointment to me.\"\nIf you want your child\nto grow up as a person\nand bring you along for the journey,\nthen you need to be able to\nmake them feel safe enough\nto make their own mistakes\nand learn from them.\nDo not just attack them\nfor falling short sometimes\nby saying, \"You are such\na disappointment to me.\"\nBut rather encourage them to try again\nby reassuring them that\nit's okay to fail sometimes\nand that you'll always be\nthere for them no matter what.\nNumber five, \"Why didn't you?\"\nSimilar to the last\npoint, asking your child\nwhy they didn't get into\nthis certain college,\nscore higher on the SATs,\nmake the starting team,\nor win a competition only serves\nto make them feel worse about themselves,\nespecially when they tried\nreally hard to please you.\nIt can ruin their self esteem\nand turn them into\nneurotic perfectionists,\nalways beating themselves up\nover every, little mistake,\njust because your words\nmade them feel like\nnothing they do can ever\nbe good enough for you.\nNumber six, \"Because I said so.\"\nStudies show that having an\nauthoritarian parenting style,\nthat is being extremely\nstrict, controlling,\nand expecting children to\nfollow the rules you've set\nwith no discussion or\ncompromise whatsoever,\ncan have many negative effects on a child.\nSome children develop poor self esteem\nand become socially inept,\nwithdrawn, and dependent,\nwhile others become more aggressive,\ndefiant, reckless, and deceptive.\nEither way, simply\ndemanding that your child\nshould submit to your will\njust because you told them so\nand that you are the parent here\nwill foster a lot of\nresentment and conflict\nin your relationship with them.\nNumber seven, \"What are\npeople going to say?\"\nDid your child come up to you\nas part of the LGBTQ + community\nor get called in the principal's office\nfor getting into a fight?\nDo they have a lot of failing grades\nor have trouble making friends?\nIf you didn't already know,\nit must have been difficult\nfor them to tell you\nbecause they were afraid\nof how you'd react.\nBut asking, \"What are\npeople going to think?\"\nOr, \"What does that say\nabout me as a parent?\"\nmakes them feel like all you care about\nis the opinion of others\nand that you see them\nas an embarrassment to the family.\nAnd number eight, \"I'm leaving\nand never coming back.\"\nLast, but definitely not least.\nIn the heat of the moment,\nyou might be tempted\nto spew threats of running\naway and never coming back\nonce you start to feel that your child\nis becoming very ungrateful\nfor all the things that you do for them.\nBut it's better to bite back your tongue\nand swallow your temper\nthan to say something\nthat will hurt them for years to come.\nAfter all, even if we might\nnot realize it at the time,\nthreats like these are\ndone with the intention\nof hurting your child and scaring them\ninto listening to you\nor doing, as you say.\nAnd emotional blackmail like this\ncan make their attachment\ntowards you and others\nas they grow up unstable and insecure.\nSo do you relate to any of\nthe things mentioned here?\nAre you a parent trying\nto learn what to avoid\nwhen raising your child\nor still trying to heal\nfrom the hurtful words of a parent?\nEven if you're neither,\nit's still important for us\nto be more considerate\nof how we treat others\nand the effect our words\ncould have on them.\nAs the saying goes, \"Be\ncareful with your words.\nOnce said they can only be\nforgiven, but never forgotten.\"\nDid you find this video insightful?\nTell us in the
