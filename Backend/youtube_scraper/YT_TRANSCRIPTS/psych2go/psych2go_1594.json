    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nDo you have habits you\nwish you could lose?\nSome small, some much bigger than others.\nYou may think learning some healthy habits\nwill make you happier.\nThat certainly is a smart idea,\nbut there are some habits\nthat you could do without.\nWorking towards losing them\nmay just be a step to\nimproving your happiness.\nSo here are six habits that\ncan make you miserable.\nNumber one, judging yourself too harshly.\nDo you judge yourself too harshly?\nSometimes you can fall into the trap\nof believing all your\nthoughts are the truth.\nIf you often pick it every detail\nor negative thought that comes your way,\nmore of this habitual way of\nnegative thinking can follow.\nIt can become a habit\nto judge yourself too\ncritically all the time,\nbut trying to push them away entirely\nmight make matters worse.\nInstead, acknowledge that\nthese thoughts are there,\nbut make your best\nattempt to question them\nbefore believing them entirely.\nSome of our thoughts are not true.\nThey're just, well, thoughts.\nPractice some compassion for yourself\nand those harsh self-judgements\nmay start to dwindle down.\nNumber two, too much social media.\nDo you use social media like Facebook,\nTikTok and Instagram too much?\nA 2013 study from the\nUniversity of Michigan\npublished in the journal \"PLOS One\"\nfound a correlation\nbetween Facebook use and dissatisfaction.\nFor two weeks,\nresearchers text messaged subjects\nto see how individuals felt each moment\nand how satisfied they\nwere with their lives.\nAs the research published states,\nresults indicate that Facebook use\npredicts negative shifts\non both of these variables over time.\nThe more people used\nFacebook at one time point,\nthe worse they felt the next\ntime we text messaged them.\nThe more they used\nFacebook over two weeks,\nthe more their life satisfaction\nlevels declined over time.\nThat habit of checking your\nsocial media notifications\nevery 1/2 hour,\nit's time to go.\nNumber three, comparing\nyourself to others.\nAre you in the habit of\ncomparing yourself to others?\nIt can be a frequent thought\nto compare yourself to other people,\nbut it can also leave you\nfeeling miserable, why?\nThere will always be something\nseemingly better out there for everyone,\nand many people often\nwant what they can't have,\nwhen really looking at what\nyou have and what you value\nis a much healthier habit.\nWe all have our own journey\nwe must take in life,\nour own circumstances\nand our own qualities\nthat make us unique.\nSo remember to show\ncompassion for yourself\nand look at what\npositively makes you, you.\nNumber four, devoting yourself\nto your favorite TV show.\nOkay, so there's nothing wrong\nwith devoting yourself\nto your favorite TV show\nonce in a while, right?\nWe've all been there,\nbut research from Emily Moyer-Guse, PhD,\nassistant professor of communication\nat Ohio State University,\nfound that when your favorite\nshow comes to an end,\nyou'll likely experience distress\ndue to the para-social relationship\nyou've formed with the show's characters.\nThe research published in \"Mass\nCommunication and Society\"\nsurveyed 403 college students\nduring the notorious 2007,\n2008 Writers Guild of America strike.\nThis was a time when television writers\nfrom the Writer's Guild went on a strike,\nseeking out higher funding for writers\nas compared to the high\nprofits of the studios\nthey were writing for.\nMany TV shows were canceled,\nwhich means plenty of\ndisappointed viewers.\nThe research found that those who watch TV\nto escape feelings of pressure,\nto relax or to simply\nenjoy the companionship\nof their show's characters\nwere more likely to be distressed\nthan those who watched TV\nsimply to pass the time.\nIndividuals who watched for companionship\nwere the most distressed when\ntheir favorite shows ended.\nSound familiar?\nBack in 2011,\nmany \"Harry Potter\" are fans\nreported feelings of\ndesertion and unhappiness\nwhen the beloved franchise ended.\nWhether you're a Slitherin or Griffin,\nthat must've hurt.\nNothing wrong with getting sucked in\nto your favorite TV show,\nbut just make sure that to make a habit\nto have a companion with you\nfor the final roll of the end credits.\nOh yeah, and bring a box of tissues.\nNumber five, believing\nyou can't change anything.\nAccepting who we are can be healthy,\nunless you're ignoring the negative habits\nthat you can change.\nWe aren't always set in stone.\nWe are always changing,\nour opinions, beliefs,\nhabits and actions can\nchange for the better.\nSo it's best to let go of the belief\nthat you can't change anything.\nThere are some things\nwhere change is possible.\nResearchers suggest\nthat seemingly permanent\nparts of your personality\ncan indeed be changed.\nIn their 2017 review article\npublished in the journal\n\"Psychological Bulletin,\"\nresearchers reviewed 207 studies\nthat had tracked changes\nin measures of personality\ntraits during interventions,\nincluding true experiments\nand pre-post change designs.\nThey found therapy could cause change\nin an individual's personality\nin as quick as four to eight weeks.\nAs the review states,\nemotional stability was\nthe primary trait domain\nshowing changes as a result of therapy,\nfollowed by extroversion.\nSo when you think all hope is lost\nor if you've been discouraged\nwith some of your behaviors,\nknow that positive change can happen.\nIt is possible to change for the better.\nAnd number six,\noften arguing with your siblings.\nDo you often quarrel with your siblings?\nA 2007 study in the \"American\nJournal of Psychiatry\"\nfound that males are at\nhigher risk for depression\nif they have a poor relationship\nwith their siblings.\nSo which topics seem to\ncause the most problems.\nIn 2012, researchers at\nthe University of Missouri\nfound that teenagers may be at higher risk\nof going through depressive symptoms,\nanxiety and low self esteem\nif their frequent arguments\nwith their siblings\nfall into two categories,\nthose categories were\nviolations of personal domain\nor conflicts over fairness and equality.\nMU assistant professor\nof psychology science\nNicole Campione-Barr\nfound that conflicts over\nissues of equality and fairness\nare correlated greater\ndepression one year later,\naccording to her research results.\nSo is it fair to argue\nwith your brother or sister\nabout who gets the last cookie?\nIt's a fair argument,\nbut it's best not to fight about it now.\nSo which habits are making you miserable?\nNow that you know\nyou can change some of your\nbehaviors for the better,\nwill you change your habits?\nDo you often fight with your siblings?\nShare with us in the comments\nand let us know what your favorite TV show\nyou are disappointed to\nsee come to an end was.\nDo you watch to pass time\nor did you form a para-social relationship\nwith one of its characters?\n\"Harry Potter,\" how you will be missed.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share
