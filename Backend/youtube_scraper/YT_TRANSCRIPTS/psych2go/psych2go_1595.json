    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey there, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome more, welcome back to our channel.\nDid you know every small everyday act\nmakes a huge impact on your lifeline?\nCurious to know which daily habits\ncan be altered to live\na healthier lifestyle?\nWell, you're in the right spot.\nHere are six habits that may kill you.\nNumber one, complaining.\nComplaining is the nemesis of joy.\nHave you ever heard this phrase before?\nThere's nothing wrong\nwith being dissatisfied,\nparticularly if it\nmotivates you to develop\nand challenge yourself.\nOn the other hand, chronic complaints\nwithout any intervention\nbreed negative thoughts,\npessimism and hopelessness.\nReinforcing a feeling of powerlessness\nin the face of anger,\ndraining your energy.\nIt only serves as a constant\nsource of discouragement\nfor you, as well as\nothers surrounding you.\nAs a result, you may develop\nan apathetic attitude\nthat saps the joy from your life\nand leads to something much worse.\nNumber two, taking vitamins\nor supplements unnecessarily.\nYes, your body does need nutrients,\nsuch as vitamins and minerals\nbut that doesn't mean that one\nshould use health supplements\nin one's diet, unless, of course,\na physician prescribes it.\nThat's because most of the\nbody's nutritional requirements\nare fulfilled by the\nfood you consume daily,\ngiven its balanced eating.\nHowever, with vitamin\nsupplements being all the rage,\nyou can unwittingly consume them\nwithout understanding the\npotential side effects.\nThe reality is that taking supplements\nwithout a need for them\ndisrupts the body's working,\ncausing more harm than good.\nIt's highly crucial that\nyou use supplements only\nwhen prescribed by your physician.\nJumping on the bandwagon is highly risky\nwhere health is concerned.\nIt's always prudent to\nget professional advice.\nNumber three, eating without\nbeing hungry and overeating.\nOvereating is almost as bad\nas missing essential meals during the day.\nDo you have the bait of\neating while watching\nor reading something?\nIt's an act after your\nown heart, isn't it?\nBut the downside is it\nusually causes one to overeat,\nleading to obesity and\nmany other health problems,\nsuch as bloating, extra body fat,\nand a higher risk of certain diseases.\nBut the good news is you can steer clear\nof all of this when you\nreduce portion sizes,\nconsume less processed foods\nand concentrate on whole foods\nto avoid overeating.\nIf you like, a dietician can\nhelp you develop an eating plan\nthat will benefit your long-term health.\nNumber four, drinking coffee\nfirst thing in the morning.\nIs the aroma of coffee your best alarm?\nYou might consider it your\ndaily dose of encouragement\nbut it's also a huge health risk\nwhen consumed first thing in the morning.\nUh oh.\nYour body tends to dehydrate\nwhile you're asleep.\nCoffee only exacerbates the issue\nand dehydrates you even more.\nTo put it lightly,\nit leaves an empty stomach\nacidic and slouching.\nYikes.\nCoffee also increases blood pressure\nand heart rate.\nAnd if it contains sugar,\nthe blood sugar levels\nwill increase as well,\nand not to forget, the caffeine.\nAccording to Healthline,\ncaffeine overdoses may exacerbate anxiety\nand may even be fatal.\nNumber five, your posture goes unchecked.\nRight at this very\nmoment are you sloughing?\nGotcha.\nLow-key, me too.\nBut studies from Harvard University show\nthat muscles strength affects balance\nin several ways.\nThe core muscles of the back,\nside, pelvis and buttocks\nform a sturdy central link\nbetween your upper and lower body.\nWeak core muscles encourage slumping,\nwhich tips your body forward\nand thus off balance.\nDr. Rene Cailliet, former director\nof the University\nof Southern California's\nDepartment of Physical Medicine\nand Rehabilitation\nmentioned in an interview\nthat hunching over too much\ncan reduce lung capacity up to 30%.\nWhen you stand up straight,\nyou'll notice how much\neasier it is to breathe.\nExercises that create\nstrength where it matters\nand stretches that relax tight muscles\nare used in balance-specific exercises\nto fix posture and balance issues.\nWorking on enhancing your core strength\nand flexibility will help\nyou improve your posture\nin just a few weeks.\nAnd number six, sitting for long hours\nwith no exercise.\nDoes your work keep you glued\nto your desk 8 to 10 hours a day?\nSometimes even more?\nAccording to research conducted\nby the National Center\nof Biotechnology Information,\nobesity, heart disease,\nelevated cholesterol levels,\ndiabetes, stress and other health issues\nhave been related to long periods\nof sitting and a lack of exercise.\nIn women, sitting for long hours\nare related to coronary heart disease,\nbreast cancer, ovarian cancer\nand many other feminine problems.\nIncorporating walking or any other form\nof exercise into your daily routine\ncan help eliminate any risks.\nDo you have any of these habits?\nIf so, do you think this video\nhelped you recognize them?\nFeel free to leave a comment down below\nwith your
