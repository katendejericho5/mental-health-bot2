video.\nLet's begin.\nWhen you hear the word genius,\nwhat do you think of?\nWe generally think of people\nwith remarkable achievements\nin areas of art, music and science\nfar beyond that of anyone else.\nHowever, scientific research into people\nwith noticeable achievements reveals\nsome surprising traits\nthat anyone can learn from, including you.\nTurns out, genius is a trait\nthat anyone can nurture.\nWith that said, here are seven ways\nto unlock your genius.\nNumber one, forget about IQ.\nSurprised?\nThought that genius was all about IQ?\nThat's what Lewis Terman thought\nwhen he recruited the students\nwith the highest IQs in\nthe US for his study.\nHe expected these brilliant students\nto become the most successful\nagainst all of their peers.\nHowever, 57 years later,\nhe was disappointed to find\nthat the majority of\nthese students lived small\nand humble lives.\nMeanwhile, others whose IQs were too low\nto qualify for the study\nachieved great things,\nlike Richard Feynman,\nwinner of the Nobel Prize in Physics.\nWhat he realized was that\nhaving an extremely high IQ\ndoes not necessarily equal high success.\nNumber two, flex your creative muscles.\nLemme ask you a question.\nHow many uses can you\nthink of for a tin can?\nResearchers used this to\nmeasure students' creativity,\nrating the quantity and originality\nof the uses they came up with.\nCreativity tests are actually\nthree times more accurate\nthan IQ tests for predicting\nwhich students become\naccomplished later on in life\nas creativity is a key\npart of being a genius.\nEinstein isn't known for\nrepeating existing theories.\nMozart isn't known for\nperforming existing symphonies\nand Pablo Picasso isn't known\nfor sticking to conventions.\nHave you ever felt like\nthe smartest person\nin the room when you\nthought of an original idea\nthat no one else came up with?\nWell, you were onto something.\nNumber three, exercise regularly.\nHave you ever come up with a solution\nto a problem while you were out and about?\nYour mind and body are inseparable,\nso much so that getting\nyour muscles moving\nalso stimulates your brain,\nimproving memory and reaction time.\nFurthermore, researchers have found\nthat regular exercise\nstrengthens your memory\nand lowers your risk of\ndementia later on in life.\nYou don't need to do an intensive\nworkout to achieve this.\nEven mild exercise like 20\nto 30 minutes of walking\nhas significant benefits.\nNumber four, engage in\ncurious thoughts and ideas.\nHave you ever been curious\nabout something that others\nhave found uninteresting?\nAccording to San Jose\nState University professor,\nGregory Feist, you might\nhave a genius trait\ncalled need for cognition.\nPeople high in this\ntrait are always curious,\nexploring new ideas, finding significance\nin ordinary things,\nand considering other perspectives.\nYou don't stick to convention,\nhide within one field or\navoid unfamiliar things.\nMany of the best ideas come\nfrom unexpected connections\nbetween unrelated thoughts.\nSo try watching a movie\nfrom a different culture,\nreading an article on a new subject\nor discuss a deep topic with a friend.\nNumber five, adopt a growth mindset.\nHow did you feel the last time you failed?\nDid you feel that you weren't good enough\nor that the activity was too hard?\nIf you have a fixed mindset,\nthe idea that you have\neither what it takes\nor you don't and can\ndo little to change it,\nyou can start to give up.\nYou may also be sensitive to criticism\nand spend more effort hiding your mistakes\nrather than learning from them.\nInstead, adopt a growth mindset,\nthe idea that personal\ngrowth is always possible\nthrough hard work and strategizing.\nYour strengths and weaknesses\nare only your starting position\nand you can always advance\nfrom your current position.\nThose with a growth\nmindset have fewer feelings\nof depression, aggression and shame,\nand more confidence,\npersistence and willingness\nto take on new challenges,\nwhich forms the stronger connections\nin your brain the next time you fail.\nRemind yourself that failure to succeed\ndoes not mean failure to progress.\nNumber six, collaborate with others.\nWhen you picture a genius,\ndo you think of a solitary\nself-made mastermind?\nResearch shows that genius\nis actually a team effort.\nIf you find the right network\nof passionate individuals,\ngreat things can happen.\nCommunities share the tools, knowledge,\ninspiration, feedback and\nwider connections needed\nto thrive in any field.\nBut you only get the best results\nif you have a diversity\nof positive relationships.\nSo those dreaded group projects\nare worth something after all.\nEven Tony Stark needed Yinsen\nto perfect the first Iron Man.\nAnd number seven, play video games.\nHave you ever heard the claim\nthat gaming is a waste of time?\nScientific experiments have actually shown\nthat video games have a positive effect\non the brain, even more than\ndedicated brain training.\nYour brain is confronted\nwith open-ended challenges\nand bombarded with information\nto sort out very quickly,\nwhich strengthens attention control,\nvisual thinking, multitasking,\nproblem solving skills,\nworking memory and creativity.\nScientists have noticed\nthat each generation\nis more intelligent than the last,\nand they think mental\nstimulation like video games\nmay play a role.\nSo there you have it.\nSeven ways to unlock your genius.\nDo you think you could try\nthese tips in your lifetime?\nOne day you might achieve great things\nand we believe in you.\nLet us know what you'll\ntry in the comments below.\nMake sure to like and\nsubscribe to Psych2Go\nfor even more psychology advice,\nand if
