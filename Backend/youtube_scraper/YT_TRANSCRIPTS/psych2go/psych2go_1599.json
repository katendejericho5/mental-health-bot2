what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nRomance is in the air.\nYour heart is racing.\nYour stomach is filled with butterflies.\nAnd you can't help but imagine a future\nwith the person you know\nyou are in love with.\nYou are in love.\nBut what does this mean exactly?\nI mean, in this scenario,\nthis is the first time\nyou've fallen in love.\nWhat are the little things to know\nthat can make a world of\ndifference in your relationship?\nIf only you knew these things.\nWell, Psych2Go is here to help you.\nHere are seven things to know\nwhen you first fall in love.\nOne, you can change.\nYou may think you will never become\na diehard fan of \"The Bachelor\",\nor any other reality TV show,\nor perhaps you've sworn\noff the taste of jello.\nIs it a solid, a liquid?\nWhat is it?\nWell, these ideas of yours may\nchange when you fall in love,\nnot specifically with\njello and reality TV,\nbut your interests and\npersonality traits may change.\nAccording to a study, published\nin the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology,\npeople in love will find themselves\nwith different personality\ntraits and interests\nafter entering into their\nrespective relationships.\nOne of the authors of the study\nsuggests individual\nself-esteem often increases\nalong with gaining a more\ndiverse sense of self.\nTwo, fear and judgment will decrease.\nLove has its many benefits.\nOne common one is that your ability\nto make overly critical\nassessments can shut down.\nOne study suggests this further.\nThe study was conducted by married couple,\nRichard Schwartz and Jacqueline Olds,\nprofessors at Harvard Medical\nSchool and couples therapists.\nIn a study, they looked into the science\nbehind the common term, \"Love is blind.\"\nAnd in a piece published\nby Harvard University,\nSchwartz explained that\nfeelings of love deactivate\nneural pathways responsible\nfor negative emotions.\nWhich ones, you ask?\nSome are fear and social judgment.\nThree, love can make you sick.\nAre you love sick?\nHave you felt the pain of heartbreak?\nWell, beside the stress and sadness\na broken heart can cause,\nlove can also have the\nchance to make you more prone\nto coming down sick.\nLove can raise levels of cortisol.\nThe stress hormone, cortisol,\ncan increase the odds\nof making you sick,\nas it has been shown to\nsuppress immune function.\nFour, misunderstandings\nare bound to happen.\nWhen you first fall in love,\nyou may think everything is\nmeant to be perfectly perfect\nin every single way,\nbut misunderstandings are\nbound to happen eventually.\nThis isn't the end of the world, though.\nYou may have thought\nyour partner meant this,\nwhen they meant that.\nMaybe your partner thought\nyou behaved a certain way\nwhen you do the exact opposite.\nDon't let simple confusion\ndisrupt your feelings for each other,\nor the growth of your relationship.\nIf it's serious, discuss it.\nIf it's really no big deal,\nit's no big deal, really.\nFive, they aren't your missing piece.\nMany can seek out love\nor be drawn to someone\nin hopes they will complete\nthem and make them one again.\nYes, your lifelong partner\ncan be one of the biggest\nparts of your life,\nbut it can be unhealthy\nto look for a partner\nin hopes they'll make you feel complete.\nIf you do feel empty,\na partner may appear to make\nyou feel better for a while.\nBut after due time,\nthose empty feelings\nwill only arise again.\nFeeling complete and finding your purpose\nis a journey you must discover\nwithin yourself first.\nYes, you can do this by\nyour partner's side too,\nbut relationships tend\nto be more successful\nwhen we already know who we are,\nand what it is we want out of life.\nThen, our perfect match may just follow.\nSix, their values can change.\nCouples often become a good\nmatch based on similar values.\nIt's one of the fundamentals\nof any healthy relationship,\nbut partners can change.\nPerhaps, your love has\njust received a new job\nand has to move to the\ncity for their future.\nBut something you originally\nboth connected on was living\nthe peaceful, simple life\nin a quiet, serene town.\nThose big city lights\njust aren't your thing.\nAnd since you can't imagine\nyourself living downtown,\nand their circumstances have now changed,\nit might be time to move on.\nYou both have different\ngoals and desires now.\nCouples fall in love.\nAnd although they may not always\nfall out of love right away,\nthey may not be a good match anymore.\nThe important thing is you\nstill have the opportunity\nto fall in love with someone\nwho now matches the person you've become.\nSeven, learn to love yourself first.\nOne of the greatest things\nto jumpstart a healthy relationship,\nloving yourself first.\nIn fact, your relationship with yourself\nis the most important\naspect of your existence.\nyou should focus on.\nWe tend to push aside\nour conflicting feelings\nand suppress the unpleasant\nemotions deep inside us.\nWe can lash out at ourselves\nwhen we feel we're not good enough.\nDoing so, we continue down the road\nof negative thoughts and self-hate.\nOne of the most crucial\nthings you can do in life\nis to expand from your narrowing beliefs\nand learn to love yourself.\nTreat yourself with\nthe compassion and care\nyou'd like from others.\nWorking on self-love can\nimprove your self-esteem\nand grow your confidence.\nRespect yourself first.\nThen, your heart will be open\nto finding your true love\nand loving them and yourself freely.\nSo, have you learned\nsomething new about love?\nWhere are you in your self-love
