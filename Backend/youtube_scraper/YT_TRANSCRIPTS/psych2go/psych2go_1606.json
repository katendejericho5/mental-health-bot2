video is sponsored by So Syncd,\na place that can match\npartners personality types,\nbased on the 16 personalities model.\nYou can access it by\nclicking the link below.\nHey, Psych2Goers!\nWelcome back to our channel.\nOkay, so you're on a romantic first date\nand you can't help but\nwonder if your date thinks\nyou're attractive as much\nas you think they are.\nWhat attractive behaviors do\nyou have that you can display\nto your date?\nWell, here are six behaviors\nthat attract people the most.\nDo you do any have them?\nNumber one, casually touch them.\nA casual and friendly touch here and there\nmay just improve your attractiveness,\nif the other person is\ncomfortable with it.\nA flirty quick nudge of the elbow\nor a tap on the shoulder\nmay just make them feel\ncloser to you.\nIn an experiment from the\nUniversity of Mississippi\nand Rhodes College\nresearchers had waitresses\nbriefly touch customers\non the hand or shoulders\nin a controlled yet natural setting.\nThe waitresses who casually\ntouched their customers\nwhen returning the change\nreceived a significantly larger tip\nthan those who did not.\nIn another study published\nin Psychology Press,\nTaylor and Francis Group\nhad men stand on the corner\nof the street and attempt to talk to women\nwho would walk by.\nThe men were more successful\nin starting a conversation\nwith a woman when they\nlightly touched the woman\non the forearm for one second.\nAs the researchers state,\nour results showed that a\nman's courtship solicitations\nare more favorably accepted by a woman\nwhen the request is accompanied\nby light tactile contact.\nThis isn't to say that everyone\nwould like to be touched\non there by a stranger,\nbut a flirty brush of the arm\nduring a romantic date\nmight not hurt your chances of\nthem finding you attractive.\n(gentle music)\nNumber three, be a leader.\nWant others to notice you?\nWhen you can be a leader.\nIn a 2014 study,\nresearchers explored\nwhether feelings towards\nother people influenced\nthe perceptions of others attractiveness.\nHaving their subjects in groups,\nthey found subordinates\nrated their group leader\nas significantly more attractive\nthan leaders outside their group.\nSo even if there is no\nrole of group leader\nin your next project,\nbe more vocal about your\nideas, teach others.\nThere are many ways you\ncan prove you are capable\nand apparently attractive group leader.\nOn your next date, suggest\na place you know all about\nand take the lead on a romantic adventure.\nIt could be fun.\nWe talked about the importance\nof your potential partner\nbeing attentive and\nremembering the little things,\nwhich is why So Syncd could\nbe the right app for you.\nThey pair couples, you have the right\namount of similarities to get each other\nand just the right amount of\ndifferences to create that\nspark for deeper, meaningful dating.\nUpon taking the personality test\nyou discover your\npersonality such as INFJ,\nso thoughtful, or ENFP,\nso curious.\nOnce you've mutually liked each other\nyou can start messaging.\nHere are what some people\nusing the app have said,\nLily, INFJ said,\n\"I didn't expect to find love so fast.\n\"Our personality types will\nbe tattooed on me somewhere.\"\nAnd Indy, ENFJ said,\n\"Matching people using personality types\n\"is such a simple and powerful concept.\n\"So Syncd helped us find love,\n\"even in this difficult time.\n\"You've really changed our lives.\n\"In fact, we're now married.\n\"Thank you.\"\nMake sure you check out the app\nin the description box\nbelow for more details.\nWe encourage you to try it\nout and give yourself a chance\nto find deeper love.\nNumber four, smile when you can.\nFeel like laughing at a funny joke?\nSmiling at a sweet comment?\nThen do so.\nAnd don't be afraid to,\nbecause smiling is quite\nattractive according to research.\nA study published in the\nbulletin of Psychonomic Society\nfound smiling might just\nmake you more attractive.\nAccording to the study\nwomen in the experiment\nwho smiled 70% of the time\nwere seen as more\ninterpersonally attractive\nthan a woman who seldom smiled.\nLooks like a comedy club\ndate might be a good idea.\nNumber five, maintain good eye contact.\nHah, your date's dreamy eyes.\nWhy not look at them?\nHarvard psychologist, Zick\nRubin conducted a study\nwhere he recorded how much\ntime lovers would spend\nlooking into each other's eyes.\nHe found that individuals\nwho were not in love\nlooked at each other\n30 to 60% of the time,\nwhile those couples deeply in love,\nthey stared into each other's eyes 75%\nof the time when talking,\nand when someone else entered\nthe room or interrupted them,\nthey were much slower to turn away\nfrom their partner's gaze.\nA little tip to really get someone\nto consider these\nfeelings of love for you,\nlook into their eyes 75% of the time.\nThe brain remembers the\nlast time someone they loved\nstared them in the same way.\nThey'll associate this stare with feelings\nof love and attraction.\nWhy this lovely memory causes\na release of phenylethylamine,\nwhich is known as a love drug.\nPhenylethylamine is released in the brain\nwhen someone falls in love.\nThis chemical too mimics the\nbrain chemistry of someone\nwho is deeply in love.\nChocolates contain phenylethylamine,\nwhich is probably why it's historically\nbeen considered an aphrodisiac.\nSo if you want your date\nto see you as attractive,\nmaybe romantically gaze\ninto their eyes a bit\nwhen you're talking to them\nand maybe some hot chocolate, (chuckles)\nchocolate.\nAnd number six, crack a joke or two.\nWho doesn't love a good joke?\nResearchers from Illinois State University\nand DePaul University found in their study\nthat when you used humor,\nwhen getting to know an\nacquaintance at first,\nthat individual has a better\nchance of liking you more.\nThey even found that\nengaging in funny tasks\nmay raise romantic attraction.\nSee, I told you that comedy club\nwas the next perfect date choice!\nTake the lead on picking your next date\nand snuggle up for some good\nold comedy and hot chocolate.\nNot only attractive, but delicious.\nSo which of these behaviors\nwill you use on your next date?\nWhere will you take them?\nHot chocolate, comedy night\nor romantic stroll hand-in-hand?\nShare with us in
