    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Number one,\ntime doesn't last forever.\nHave you been working\ntowards a lifelong goal?\nTime is fleeting.\nAs you grow older,\nyou'll gain more wisdom,\nmoney, and memories,\nbut you'll also have less\ntime to experience it all.\nAligning yourself with what you truly want\ncan help make your time\nfeel more fulfilling.\nMaybe that would entail\nsome tough sacrifices\nat the present moment like stepping out\nof a toxic relationship\nor fixing a bad habit.\nThese sacrifices may sting\nbut you'll eventually\ngrow out of the pain and enter a new,\nhappier era of your life.\n(speaks in Spanish)\nI'm new to Spanish but can you\ntranslate what I just said?\nLet me know in the comments below.\nThis video was made\npossible thanks to Babbel,\nthe number one language\nlearning app in the world.\nIf you're interested in\nlearning what I just said\ninstead of using Google Translate,\nlearn Spanish via Babbel.\nYou only need to spend like\n10 to 15 minutes every day\nand you'll start speaking\nit in three weeks.\nOne of my biggest dreams\nis to travel and order food\nin Barcelona and maybe interact\nwith Messi football fans.\nBabbel has made learning so much easier.\nThe courses are handcrafted\nby over 150 language experts.\nIt's a science-backed approach\nwhich means you learn more effectively.\nBabbel's local experts\ninfuse all of the courses\nand experiences with local insights\nso you'll be immersed and\ninteracting in real life\nsituations and dialogues.\n15 hours of Babbel are\nequivalent to a semester\nof a college course but\nthe only difference is that\nBabbel makes it fun.\nClick on the description link below\nand Babbel will give you up to 65% off\nso you can start speaking\na brand new language\nin just three weeks.\nThank you, Babbel, for\nsponsoring this video\nand let me know whether you\nagree if Messi is the GOAT.\n(speaks in Spanish)\nNumber two, you need to take the risk.\nDo you play what if situations\nconstantly in your head?\nAs you grow older,\nyou'll start to look back\nand ponder on your past self's choices.\nPeople at an older age\nwill start to reflect on\nwhether they have lived a meaningful life.\nMany are at peace with\nthe decisions they've made\nbut some will feel a sense of despair\nand look back with\nfeelings of regret, shame,\nand disappointment.\nYou may fail a couple of times\nbut ignore that nagging voice\nin your head and take that risk.\nNumber three, don't act\nlike someone you're not.\nDo you put up a fake\nfront in front of others\nso that you won't feel out of place?\nIt's normal to feel the\nneed to fit in a crowd.\nIt's how our ancestors made sure\nthey didn't get left behind\nto fend for themselves.\nIt's a shared human trait\nbut if you don't stick up\nfor what you believe in,\nyou'll live under a false,\nmasked identity.\nYou may end up as someone\nthat constantly wants\nto please others at the\nexpense of your own happiness.\nNumber four, take care of your body.\nDo you eat well, sleep well,\nand regularly exercise?\nRemember, you only have one body.\nYour early years and\nhabits dictate the way\nyour health will transform\nand grow in the future.\nDo you drink a full glass\nof water with your meal?\nDo you run or exercise?\nHow about sleeping a good\neight hours every night?\nBuild up your healthy habits now\nso that your future self will be happy\nthat you're still healthy at 70.\nNumber five, don't be\ntoo tough on yourself.\nDo you talk negatively about yourself?\nMaking mistakes can be\ndistressing at times,\nespecially if your mistake\nhas negatively impacted\nother people.\nYou may resort to thinking\nnegatively about yourself\nduring those moments,\ncalling yourself a failure,\ndumb, or stupid, but by\nbeating yourself down,\nyou are structuring your mind into one\nthat regards pessimism\nas your normal mindset.\nA self-defeating mind can\ndecrease your motivation,\nworsen a sense of helplessness,\nand even cause depression.\nNumber six, building strong relationships.\nDo you have a hard time opening up\neven with your friends?\nPeople who have good\nrelationships with family,\nfriends, and loved ones not\nonly have fewer health problems\nas they age but they\nfeel more fulfilled, too.\nFostering a positive\nsocial life can impact\nhow your life will pan out.\nWhether you find your\ncircle at school or work,\nhaving genuine bonds with people is one of\nthe most important things in life.\nNumber seven, life throws curveballs.\nHave you been waiting for\nsomething great to happen\nonly for life to take it away from you?\nNo matter how ready you initially were,\nsometimes plans don't always go your way.\nFactors outside of your control\ncould stop or hinder your plans\nand you're just left to react to them.\nDuring these moments, it can be tempting\nto stop and give up but\nwhile it may seem difficult\nto get back up, know\nthat it'll be worth it\nif it's something you\ntruly are passionate about.\nNumber eight, material goods\ndon't bring your life joy.\nDo you live extravagantly or\npurchase things impulsively?\nMoney is an important tool\nbut it can lead many people astray.\nIf you let it dictate you,\nyou'll focus your efforts\non just increasing\na number in your bank account\nwhile sacrificing the things\nthat make life truly worth it.\nLife isn't about a new\nphone or that luxury bag.\nIf you spend your time\nchasing after material goods,\nyou'll take time away from\nthe other parts of your life as well.\nReflect on what's important to you.\nChances are, it's\nsomething money can't buy.\nNumber nine, don't give up too quickly.\nRemember when you started\na good habit strong\nbut failed to follow\nthrough after a while?\nYou can't achieve something\nwithout putting in the effort.\nSometimes, this effort will\nlast you many hours and weeks\nbefore you'll truly see results.\nThis can be daunting for many people,\neven causing them to stop\nright as their journey\nstarts to kick off.\nYou don't have to work all at\nonce to get ahead and succeed\nin what you set yourself out to be,\nyou just have to do small,\nconsistent steps every day\nand after some time, you'll\nsee your efforts bear fruit.\nAnd number 10, be grateful every day.\nEach moment, each day, each\nsecond that passes won't return.\nWhile some days may be hard\nor even months and years,\nlife only happens once.\nBe grateful for the little\nthings and big things\nand everything in between.\nLife isn't always beautiful.\nOtherwise, we wouldn't know what separates\nthe bad days from the good days.\nFocus and be grateful for those good days\nand days that make life worth living\nand you'll realize that your life story\nisn't all that bad after all.\nSo, will you take any of\nthese lessons and apply them?\nHave these life lessons\nhelped change your thinking?\nLife isn't a linear path.\nIt's full of ups, downs, and in betweens\nand there's no right or wrong path.\nWithout the expectations\nof others and money,\nchoose the path that\nyou feel the happiest in\nand don't be afraid to take the plunge.\nYour future self will be happy you lived\nfor your own conviction and passion.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and
