    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to a channel.\nEach of your views,\nlikes, comments and shares\nhelps us make psychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone.\nSo thank you, now to the video.\nAre you in a relationship?\nDo you have a crush on someone right now?\nAre you really in love, or are\nyou just emotionally hungry?\nEmotional hunger can be caused\nby deprivation in childhood.\nThose who suffer from emotional hunger\nusually look to rely on\nsomething or someone else,\nto fill a void or emptiness in themselves.\nSACAC counseling, describes\nthat emotional hunger\ncan look like love, and\nis often mistaken for it.\nBut it has the opposite effect\non the person that's directed toward.\nLove nurtures, while emotional\nhunger drains the others\nand leaves them empty.\nIf you started your\nrelationship in desperation\nwith only attention and affection in mind,\nit's best to evaluate if that desire\nis being mistaken as true love.\nSo how do you know if you're confusing\nemotional hunger for love?\nWell, here are six signs that\nyou are emotionally hungry.\nNumber one, you seek approval\nand adapt to what others want.\nDo you jump to conclusions\nabout what others think of you?\nWell, if you often determine\nhow others view you,\nthat is a sign of emotional hunger.\nFurthermore, seeking their approval\nand adapting to what you think\nthey want is another sign.\nIn reality, you are\nsimply stressing yourself\nby assuming what others want of you.\nWhen in doubt, the best\nyou can do is ask them.\nNumber two, you give all of yourself.\nIf you're emotionally\nhungry for a relationship,\nodds are you'll seek it\nfrom just about anywhere.\nThis means you could be\ngiving too much of yourself,\nwhen you finally do get ahead of\nwhat it is you think you need.\nAre you always available for your partner?\nDo you overly do favors for them\nat the risk of your own needs?\nYou may view that giving all of yourself\nwill ensure the relationship will last.\nIn reality, you are needs\nshould be met as well.\nDoing so, can give you\nthe confidence needed\nto lessen your emotional health.\nNumber three, you are\ndependent on social status.\nThose who suffer from emotional hunger\nmay seek out their needs\nby having many friends.\nThe more the healthier,\nor that's what they think.\nThey may suffer from self-esteem.\nSo they seek out comfort and validation\nfrom a strong social status.\nThey may even feel a strong\nattachment to someone\nwho has high status as a way to have\nvalidation through them.\nIf their emotional reserves are not met,\nthey believe a high social\nstatus could be a fix.\nWhile support from friends is helpful,\nit's also a great idea to look inwards,\nand find what it is you\nneed from yourself first.\nIf you work towards having\na positive self image,\nyour emotional hunger\nshould lessen over time.\nNumber four, you don't have boundaries.\nDo you struggle with boundaries\nin your relationships?\nThis is also a sign.\nIt's best to learn to respect\nyour partner's boundaries,\nand set some healthy ones, if\nyou don't already have them.\nQuality time together with\nyour partner is great.\nBut it's also healthy\nto be alone sometimes.\nOr experience new things\nwith new groups of people.\nNumber five, you solely use\ncasual sex or substances\nto meet your emotional needs.\nSome struggling with emotional hunger\nmay just be looking for\na way to numb the pain\nof their emotional needs.\nThey may isolate\nthemselves or turn to drugs\nor alcohol as a way to cope.\nAvoiding important feelings\nby seeking certain numbing\nor thrilling sensations,\nis just another sign of emotional hunger.\nAnother way this can show itself,\nis through using casual sex,\nsolely as a way to have\nyour emotional needs met.\nAccording to therapist, Markie Keelan,\nsex can be the easiest\nway to trick ourselves\ninto getting our emotional needs met.\nWe get validation that we are worthy\nof another person's time,\nmixed with endorphins\nand the pleasure centers\nof our brain make us feel good.\nAnd number six, you're overly clingy.\nMany enjoy some love and attention.\nBut if you are overly clingy,\nyour partner may feel suffocated.\nEmotionally hungry individuals may show\ntheir devotion and affection\nearly in the relationship.\nSimilar to giving too much of\nyourself in a relationship,\nsome individuals can be overly clingy,\nas a way to ensure the relationship lasts.\nWhile attention and\ndefection are of course,\na healthy part of a relationship,\nSome can mistake this desire\nfor constant affection\nand attention as love.\nAccording to SALAC counseling,\nwhen a person grows up without\nlove or affection as a child,\nthat manifests itself into a strong need\nfor emotional closeness as an adult.\nTo get this need met,\na deprived person may latch\nonto a romantic partner,\nor even their child.\nThe result is an emotionally\ndraining relationship.\nWhere the victim is\nconstantly having their\nemotional energy drained\nby the deprived person.\nSo, did you relate to any of you signs?\nIf so, what steps do\nyou plan to take next?\nShare with us in the comments.\nThe first that to lessening\nthat emotional craving\nis to look at your needs,\nand how you can satisfy them.\nSelf-reflection is key\nto having a healthy mind.\nAnd with a positive self image,\nyou can wave a strong goodbye\nto that emotional hunger\nthat's just eating at you.\nIf you found this video helpful,\ndon't forget to click the like
