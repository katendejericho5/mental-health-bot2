arguing\nwith your parents?\nDo they never understand\nwhat you're going through?\nParents are people too,\nand they make mistakes.\nBut unlike others, their\ncareless mistakes can lead\nto a lot of emotional\nbaggage for their children.\nAnd one of the most harmful,\nyet often unintentional ways\nparents hurt their children,\nis by gaslighting them, which is defined\nas a form of psychological\nand emotional manipulation\nthat leads its victims\nto doubting themselves\nand their own perceptions of reality.\nCurious to know more?\nHere are seven signs that your\nparents are gaslighting you.\nNumber one, they don't listen to you.\nHow do conversations with\nyour parents usually go?\nAre they open to listening to your ideas\nand hearing what you have to say,\nor do they simply expect\nyou to do as you're told,\njust because they said so?\nHaving parents who don't listen\nto you can be frustrating,\nto say the least, and\nconstantly being patronized\nand treated like a child\ncan surely do a number\nto anyone's self-esteem.\nWhen you don't feel heard,\nespecially in your own\nhome by your own parents,\nit can plant the seeds of\ninsecurity and self-doubt\nin your own mind that can\nbecome harder and harder\nto uproot the older you get.\nNumber two, they decide things for you.\nDo your parents pick\nyour clothes out for you\nor tell you who you can\nand can't be friends with?\nDo they forbid you from\nseeing certain people\nor going to certain places just\nbecause they don't like it?\nDo they make your decisions for you\nwithout even asking you what you want?\nWhile it's not uncommon for parents\nto tell you what you should\nlike or how you should act,\nespecially when you're still young,\nit can become toxic and problematic\nwhen they don't allow you the freedom\nto decide things for yourself\nand to establish your\nown sense of identity,\nfree from their influence and control.\nNumber three, they tend\nto dismiss your problems.\nWhether it's a fight\nwith your best friend,\na broken heart after a breakup,\nor the pressure of getting good grades\nand doing well in your finals,\nyour parents may not understand\nthat the struggles you\nare facing are heavy\nand very real to you.\nInstead of empathizing with you,\nthey may simply tell you to\nmove on and forget all about it\nbecause it won't matter in a few weeks,\nand there's no use\ncrying over spilled milk.\nBut invalidating your feelings,\nis a common example of gaslighting.\nNumber four, they tell\nyou you're overreacting.\nDo your parents roll their eyes\nand say you're overreacting\nwhenever you try to open up to them?\nTelling someone they're\njust being dramatic\nor being too sensitive\ncan be a telltale sign\nthat they're gaslighting you.\nAnd if your parents do it to you so often\nthat it starts to make you feel guilty\nor ashamed for feeling a certain way,\nthat is a clear sign as\nany that something is wrong\nin the way your parents treat you.\nNumber five, they deny their shortcomings.\nAnother warning sign your\nparents might be gaslighting you,\nis if you feel like,\nyou can never have an honest\nimmature conversation with them\nabout the flaws in your relationship.\nThis may mean feeling like you\nhave to keep certain things,\nsuch as how you wanna be treated\nor when you don't like what\nthey said about you to yourself\nbecause you know they're\nnot going to wanna hear it.\nInstead, you know they'll\ndeny their shortcomings\nand justify their bad behaviors\nby saying things like,\n\"well, that's not how I see it,\"\nor \"you should be grateful,\nI'm only doing this for your own good.\"\nNumber six, they shift\nthe blame towards you.\nSimilar to the last point,\ninstead of owning up to their mistakes\nand taking responsibility for it,\nthey simply shift the blame towards you\noften by playing the victim.\nNothing is ever their fault\nbecause their fingers are\nalways pointed at somebody else,\nready to shift the blame the\nmoment something goes wrong,\nand most of the time, it's you.\nSelf-righteous and sanctimonious,\nyour parents may gaslight\nyou by becoming defensive\nand turning every valid\ncriticism you have,\nno matter how gently you give it,\ninto a full-on screaming match\nand pointing out all\nof your flaws instead.\nAnd number seven, they never\njust take your word for it.\nLast, but certainly not least,\nthis is perhaps one of the most common\nand most often unintentional ways,\nparents gaslight their children.\nIf you come to them with a problem,\nsay for example, like you're\nbeing bullied at school,\nthey never just take your word for it.\nThey have to hear it from someone else\nbefore they believe it,\nand say things like,\n\"are you sure, maybe you\nvote them in some way\nand this is all just a misunderstanding.\"\nUltimately, your word\nisn't good enough for them,\nand it won't be long\nbefore it stops being\ngood enough for you too.\nDid you relate to any of\nthe signs
