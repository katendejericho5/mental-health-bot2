back to another video.\nThank you so much for all the love\nand support you've given us,\nenabling us to make\nyet another exploration\ninto everyday psychology.\nSo let's begin.\nAre you dating a highly sensitive person?\nOr do you identify as an HSP?\nDating can be awkward, uncomfortable,\nand downright worrisome,\nno matter who you are.\nBeing a highly sensitive person,\nit's tricky enough to navigate\nan overstimulating world,\nbut adding another person to the mix.\nIf this feels overwhelming,\nyou're not alone.\nIt's complicated, but it\ncan certainly be done.\nAnd when it is, it can\nfeel also rewarding.\nThere's a lot you can try\nin order to make dating\nas comfortable and fun as possible.\nHere are 10 secrets about dating\na highly sensitive person.\nOne, an HSP will notice and will care\nif you're not being genuine.\nDid you know they can\nget a read on your vibe\nthrough tiny details,\nsuch as your body language\nand facial expression,\noftentimes they just know.\nSomething between you\nwill probably feel off\nif you try to get away with a lie,\neven if neither of you can\ntell what it is at first.\nSticking to authenticity stops things\nfrom getting lost in translation.\nTwo, communication is key.\nDoes your partner have\nany specific triggers\nor do you feel uncomfortable\nin certain situations?\nLetting your partner\nknow about such things\nhelps increase understanding.\nThe more you know and communicate,\nthe more you can be there for\none another in any situation.\nIf anything, you'll just be\nmore prepared for the next date.\nIt can also help you\navoid unnecessary stress.\nFor example, a moderately crowded cafe\nis probably relaxing for a lot of people,\nbut some may just peace\nmay be overstimulated\nby a few voices and\nmachines in an echoing room.\nThree, know that an HSP's\nenvironment affects them greatly.\nLisa Petsinis, a highly\nsensitive person and blogger\nat highly sensitive refuge,\nrecounts how she felt she\nwould die from the shrillness\nand force of the sound of\nthe house alarm system,\nwhich had malfunctioned and\nrang for two hours straight.\nFinally, she ripped the\nwires apart in desperation.\nPetsinis's case is not unusual\nfor highly sensitive individuals.\nHSPs will hone in on\nslight sounds, smells,\nmovements, and even tastes\nthat others don't notice.\nThis can be extremely\noverwhelming at times,\nespecially when trying to\nfocus on another person.\nBut if things get overstimulating,\na little support and a lot of patience\ncan help do the trick.\nFour, HSPs feel emotions intensely too.\nHSPs are highly perceptive of emotion.\nAn HSP might be moved\nto tears by a sad song\nor a few sweet words.\nSo keep this in mind\nwhen picking your next date night movie.\nDon't feel like emotional expression\nneeds to be avoided though.\nJust as with any sensitivity,\nit can be just as beautiful\nas it is frustrating.\nHandling these feelings in productive ways\ncan help bring the two\nof you closer together.\nFive, it may help to plan ahead.\nIf you took your date ice\nskating as a surprise,\nyou'd probably let them know\nto bring a jacket, right?\nYou can think about\nsensitivities the same way.\nA little communication and preparation\nwill help the date run a lot smoother.\nGoing somewhere loud, bring headphones.\nA long car ride, maybe a fidget object\nand downloading a podcast will help.\nResources such as social\nmedia and good old Google\ncan help you think of the\nevening of your dreams.\nSix, give HSPs some time to adjust.\nFor highly sensitive people,\nnearly any, and every change\ncan feel disruptive and scary.\nEven the change of\nseasons affects some HSPs.\nAnd no, not in the same way as\nseasonal affective disorder.\nSo you can imagine how\njarring sudden changes can be.\nIf your partner doesn't\nseem relaxed in a new place\nor even in a new relationship,\nthey're still feeling things out\nand would much appreciate\na little space in time.\nSeven, you will probably learn something\nif you listen closely.\nIs your partner prone to noticing\ninteresting particulars\nthroughout the day?\nDo they remember things that others don't\nbecause they're so detail oriented?\nHighly sensitive people\ntake in a lot of information\non a nearly constant basis.\nIt can definitely be overwhelming,\nbut it can also be pretty useful.\nTalking to an HSP will\nlikely keep you engaged.\nSensitive individuals tend\nto move beyond smalltalk\nrather quickly.\nEight, don't ignore their discomfort\nor make a scene out of it.\nImagine yourself in their shoes.\nHow would you want someone\nyou're with to react\nif you told them something\nwas bothering you?\nIt can be hard to know what to say or do\nwhen something comes up,\nespecially when it's sudden,\nbut it's more about how you react\nthan the actual words you utter\nthat makes all the difference.\nIgnoring their feelings certainly\nwon't help the situation,\neven if you're just\ntrying to distract them.\nOdds are not much will be able\nto take their attention away\nfrom their surroundings.\nSo a simple suggestion, like,\nshould we step outside for a minute?\nOr a straightforward question like,\nwhat would you like to do should suffice.\nNine, choose surprises carefully.\nOn a scale from one to\n10, how difficult is it\nto plan a surprise date night for an HSP?\nChances are you won't be\nable to keep it a surprise\nfor long.\nBecause highly sensitive\npeople are so perceptive,\nthey may intuitively feel\nthat you are hiding something\nwhich might prompt them to ask.\nOn the other hand,\nsurprising and HSP with a hug from behind\ncan be so startling that it\ntakes more than a few seconds\nfor them to recover from.\nEven the dreaded \"I have\nto tell you something\"\nsets in HSP's heart pounding.\nIt helps if the suspense\nelement is kept to a minimum\nwhen dating an HSP.\n10, stop using phrases like\n\"too sensitive\" and \"too much.\"\nYou want to date someone who\nmakes you feel good, right?\nFor an HSP, this might translate\ninto looking for someone\nwho accepts their\nsensitivities without judgment.\nIt's already emotionally draining\nto deal with constant overstimulation.\nSo it can be truly disheartening\nto feel like someone\nis simply tolerating rather\nthan choosing to be with you.\nSimple phrases like overly\nsensitive and too much\ncarry more weight than you think.\nSo it's important to\nchoose words carefully\nand listen to each\nother with an open mind.\nWe hope we were able to\ngive you a little insight\ninto some of the ways that\nset HSPs apart from the crowd.\nAre you dating an HSP or do you\nidentify as an HSP yourself?\nDid you relate to any of these points?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nand subscribe button\nand share it with someone\nwho might benefit from it.\nThanks for
