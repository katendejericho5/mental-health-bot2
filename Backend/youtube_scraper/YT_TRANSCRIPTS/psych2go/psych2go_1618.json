And with whom does the blame lie?\nEmotions. Your emotions are vital.\nThey tell you a lot\nabout your surroundings\nand how to best move forward.\nBut how to tell when they begin\nto control you altogether,\nhere are five signs that you\nmight be acting out of emotion\nand that it might be beneficial\nfor you to take a step back\nand process your emotions\nprior to moving forward.\nOne, you focus on getting back at them.\nAre you often trying to create\nin them the same feeling\nthat they instilled in you back then?\nThe saying \"Two wrongs don't make a right\"\nreally holds true here.\nIn a burst of emotion,\nyou sort of retaliate.\nAs a result, you fail to realize\nthat this kind of response\nreally doesn't help\nthe situation at all.\nIt continues to foster ill will\nand does not allow for\nthe situation to cool\nor a solution to present itself.\nTwo, you here rather than listen.\nAre you in the habit of\nallowing others to speak\njust so you can deliver a response?\nWhen you hear them out just so\nyou can formulate an answer,\nyou're not really listening.\nYou're enabled to truly\ngrasp and understand\nwhere the other person's coming from.\nYou may be using that information\nthat they give you as ammo\nto strengthen your points and\nshoot it right back at them.\nIt might be something\nto keep an eye out for\nas listening without understanding\ncauses one to jump to conclusions.\nYou may fail to see the bigger picture\nand end up acting rashly.\nThree, you play the blame game.\nAre you quick to believe that\neveryone else has wronged you\nand that you've done everything perfectly?\nWhen emotions run high,\nyou become insistent\nupon proving the other wrong.\nThis can cloud your\njudgment of who's at fault.\nIt makes it difficult\nfor you to introspect\nand own up to your mistakes.\nAs a result, you grasp another shoulder\nto shift the burden onto.\nThinking, \"Maybe I did\nsomething wrong here\"\ncan help prevent things from\nblowing out of proportion.\nFour, you're set on\nmulling over the details.\nAre you replaying that situation over\nand over again in your head?\nDo you find it hard to forgive and forget?\nIf the solution seems out of focus\nthat's because you're more\nfocused on what happened\nand how it made you feel.\nAnd this isn't to say\nthat you're not allowed\nto express your emotions,\nyou definitely are.\nBut if you're constantly\nfocusing on the negative\nand not striving to come to a resolution\nor a better way to move forward,\nthat might be a sign\nthat you're running away\nwith your emotions at that point.\nFive, there is no pause between\nintense emotion and action.\nSo, think of the last time you experienced\na really intense emotion.\nDid you act on it immediately?\nChances are you did not pause to ponder.\nOftentimes when you're acting\nfrom a very emotional mind,\nit lacks logic.\nEven though emotions tell\nyou how to best respond\nto a situation, if it's\na really intense one,\nsometimes that reaction\nor emotional response\nwill elicit something in you,\neven you yourself don't recognize.\nAnd so you act in a way that\nis so not you, in retrospect.\nAs the saying goes,\n\"Think before you act\".\nThis shows taking a step\nback to really think\nabout what just happened\nand how you should respond,\nhelps ground you in the present\nrather than letting emotions fly high.\nSo, should suppressing your\nemotions be it out of fear,\nout of embarrassment or out of shame,\nbe your preferred response?\nRather it is prudent to\nbest utilize your emotions\nin an effective way.\nBy learning to recognize process\nand express these feelings,\nyou can stay true to yourself.\nEven in the face of extreme\nemotion staying connected\nwith rational thought\nhelps you reach a state\nwhere you're a bit calmer and can respond\nwith a more level head.\nSuch an approach benefits not\nonly you, your mental health,\nand also the people around you\nand the relationships that you have.\nDo any of these describe your experience,\nor are there any signs that\naren't included in this list?\nLeave a comment down below\nand please feel free to share\nany thoughts you have as well.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton and share it\nwith those out there wondering\nwhy they always see red.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Pysch2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nThanks for watching."
