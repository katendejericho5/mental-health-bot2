    "transcript": "- [Announcer] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwhen you hear the terms,\npsychopath and sociopath,\nwhat comes to mind?\nSome people might think of\npeople who commit violent acts\nwith no remorse,\nwhile this can be true in some cases,\nthis does not reflect\neveryone with the conditions.\nSo with that said,\nhere are five ways to tell\nsociopaths and psychopaths apart,\nand how they're diagnosed.\n(gentle music)\nLet's start with how a psychopath\nor sociopath is diagnosed.\nWhile psychologists agree that\nsociopaths and psychopaths\nare different from one another,\nthey are actually given\nthe same diagnosis,\nas both exist under the term\nanti-social personality disorder.\nASPD is a condition characterized\nas a lack of empathy and\ndisregard towards laws and rules.\nIt's also important to\nknow that antisocial refers\nto harmful behaviors towards other people.\nIt's not the same as asocial,\nwhich is classified by introversion.\nGenerally, people with\nASPD will exhibit disregard\nfor the feelings of others,\ndisregard to the laws and rules,\nno remorse after hurting others,\naggression and dangerous behaviors.\nThe difference lies in how\nthese symptoms are portrayed.\nSome psychologists argue that psychopathy\nis a more severe form of ASPD,\nwhile others think\nthat it is something completely different.\nSociopaths don't care about others,\nwhile psychopaths pretend to.\nSociopaths tend to make it clear\nthat they don't care\nabout the needs of others\nbecause of this,\nthey may have extremely unstable\nand abusive relationships.\nPsychopaths on the other hand,\ncan be much more difficult to spot.\nThey tend to blend in well\nwith the people around them\nand can fake their emotions\nto avoid drawing attention,\nbecause of this psychopaths\nmay appear completely normal,\nsometimes so much so\nthat they have long lasting relationships\nand families unaware of their condition.\nSociopaths are impulsive\nwhile psychopaths tend to be methodical.\nGenerally, sociopaths may have\na difficult time controlling\ntheir emotions and lash\nout in explosive outbursts\nin a short period of time.\nThey may carry out violent\nacts and crimes quickly,\nand in the heat of the moment.\nPsychopaths on the other hand,\ntend to be much more calculated\nand thoughtful in their approach.\nThey may come up with elaborate plans\nto commit horrible acts,\nand do so without drawing\ntoo much attention.\nSociopaths are generally a\nproduct of their environment\nwhile psychopaths are born that way.\nNature versus nurture is used to describe\nwhether a person's behavior\nis a product of genetics\nor how they were raised.\nTypically, it is believed\nthat sociopaths develop\nas a result of trauma and\nneglect throughout childhood.\nPsychopaths on the other hand,\nare believed to develop\nas a result of genetics\nand less so from how they grow up.\nSimply put, sociopathy is\nbelieved to be learned,\nand psychopathy is inherited.\nSociopaths can feel empathy\nin certain situations\nwhile psychopaths cannot.\nSome psychologists believe that sociopaths\ncan feel empathy towards\nothers in certain situations\ndue to the learned nature\nof their condition.\nHowever, this can be inconsistent,\nand may only be present in\nspecific isolated instances.\nSome would argue that sociopaths\nhave a sense of right and\nwrong, just a weak one.\nPsychopaths on the other hand,\nmay not be able to feel\nempathy in any context\nand usually have no\nconcept of right and wrong.\nSociopaths tend to be unstable\nwhile psychopaths are stable.\nIt can be easier to spot\nsomeone who is a sociopath\ndue to the impulsive and aggressive nature\nthat they tend to display.\nTheir behavior may be bold\nand show itself in their\nchaotic relationships.\nAs psychopaths are more\nmethodical and calculated,\nthey show fewer signs of abnormality.\nThey can also be extremely\nmanipulative and charming,\nwhich fools people into thinking\nthat everything is ordinary.\nWhile sociopaths tend\nto live on the fringe\nand avoid education,\npsychopaths may become highly\nsuccessful in their fields.\nWhile psychopaths can\ndevelop mood disorders\nlike depression,\nthey tend to have a high level of control\nover their emotions.\nSo did this video shed some\nlight on the differences\nbetween sociopaths and psychopaths?\nPsychopaths and sociopaths are similar,\nbut are not the same,\nwith many contrasting personality traits.\nIt is important to know that\nanyone with any kind of ASPD\nis capable of receiving treatment,\nand receiving the proper\nhelp can make a difference.\nLet us know what you thought\non this topic in the comments.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find insight in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell from our content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThank you for watching, and\nwe'll see you next time."
