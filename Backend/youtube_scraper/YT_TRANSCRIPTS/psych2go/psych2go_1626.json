for dating as an introvert.\nNumber one, try not to assume\nhow your date sees you.\nDo you tend to assume what\npeople are thinking about you?\nAs an introvert, you might not\ntalk about yourself as much,\nwhich means there are\nmany things your date\nwon't know about you.\nHow about taking charge of\nthose and bringing up a topic\non something you like.\nThis way, your focus can be on\nwhat you enjoy talking about\nrather than overthinking\nhow your date views you.\nWho knows, this might lead you\nto uncover similar interests.\nNumber two, do things your way.\nDo you ever turn down dates\nbecause you're not comfortable\nwith the suggested activity?\nIf things like bar scenes,\naren't for you,\nhow about suggesting an\nalternative meetup spot?\nPlaces like cafes or restaurants\ncan provide a much more intimate space\nthat creates a warm and\nmore inviting conversation.\nIf the person you're dating,\nisn't willing to try things you like,\nthen they're most likely\nnot the one for you.\nNumber three, wear something\ncomfortable and familiar.\nIf you hate wearing a dress and heels,\nforcing yourself into such an\noutfit is going to leave you\nfeeling out of your comfort\nzone and more self-conscious.\nIf on the other hand, you love\nwearing a dress and heels,\nthen by all means, go ahead.\nThe main point here\nis to wear what you will\nfeel most comfortable in.\nThat way you can focus on\nengaging with the other person,\nrather than thinking about\nthe outfit you're wearing.\nNumber four, prep a little\non conversational topics.\nIf you find yourself being extra anxious\nover what to talk about,\nmaybe you could try thinking\nof a few conversations starters\nbefore the date.\nThis way you can go into the date,\nfeeling more confident and relaxed.\nSome conversations starter topics\nmight include interesting\nanecdotes of your life\nor a particular questions you\nwould like to ask your date.\nOnce the conversation start,\nit's often much easier to maintain them.\nNumber five, focus on yourself.\nDo you tend to overanalyze\neverything after a date?\nSuch as if and when they'll text you\nor whether they'll ask\nyou on another date.\nRather than obsessing\nover how the other person\nthinks the date went,\ntry to focus on yourself\nand what's important to you.\nThis will help you learn to\nlove your introverted demands\nfor withdrawal and how to balance dating\namongst all the other areas of your life.\nNumber six, be well fed.\nHave you ever been so hungry\nthat you can't focus on the task at hand?\nWell, there's nothing quite like a hungry\nand therefore seemingly\nimpatient person on a date.\nIf you're getting hungry right before,\nmaybe have a quick snack.\nSo your attention\nis not solely focused\non your rumbling tummy.\nThis will allow you to feel\nmore present on the date,\nand it'll be a more enjoyable experience\nfor the both of you.\nNumber seven,\ndon't take tips from movies or TV shows.\nWhilst we all might have\nsecretly wanted to be\nas charming as Mary Jensen or\nas smooth as Joey Tribbiani.\nThere is a not so fine line\nbetween reality and fantasy.\nTV shows and movies are a\ngreat source of entertainment,\nbut that's all we should\nview them as entertainment.\nDon't use them as a\nhandbook to real life dating\nbecause unlike these perfectly scripted,\nproduced and edited shows,\nour lives don't always\nhave the happy ending\nthat movies promise.\nNumber eight,\nlisten to some music before\nyou step out the door.\nIs music something that alters your mood?\nPlaying feel good tunes\nthat make you wanna dance\nand sing along right before a date\ncan help you feel more energetic,\nenthused and confident.\nBefore your date,\nhow about empowering yourself\nwith your favorite songs.\nPerhaps some K-pop maybe\nsome Ariana Grande,\nor did someone say Lizzo?\nNumber nine,\nallow yourself to express things.\nIf you're feeling a\ncertain way, let it out.\nIf you're really enjoying\nyour date, let them know.\nIf they've said something\nthat doesn't sit right,\nyou're welcome to share your thoughts.\nYour emotions are valid in any setting.\nSo if you have something\nyou wanna say, say it.\nIt can help the other\nperson feel appreciated\nand invite them to share how they feel.\nAnd it can also help stimulate\ninteresting discussions.\nDon't hold yourself back,\nletting your date know\nmore about how you feel\nwill inevitably let them learn\nmore about who you truly are.\nAnd number 10, date someone who gets you.\nwhilst there's always room for compromise,\nultimately, you should date someone\nwho gets you and accepts\nyou for who you are.\nIf you're wanting some\nextra encouragement,\ntry new activities, dating\nan extrovert can help,\nbut if they make you\nfeel bad about yourself\nor overly push you to do\nthings you don't wanna do,\nthey probably aren't the one for you.\nWhen you're with someone who\nmakes you feel
