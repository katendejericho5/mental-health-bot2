    "transcript": "- [Lily] Hi, Psych2Goers, and\nwelcome back to another video.\nYour love and support have enabled us\nto bring another wealth\nof everyday psychology,\nso let's explore.\nWhat comes to mind when\nyou hear psychopath?\nIt is used to describe anyone\nranging from serial killers\nto problematic exes.\nIn reality, however,\npsychopaths make up only 1%\nof the general population\nas found in a study by Freeman in 2011.\nSo what basically is the\ndefinition of psychopathy?\nAccording to a study,\npsychopathy is not an official diagnosis,\nbut refers to a combination\nof behavioral traits,\nincluding antisocial\nbehavior, callousness,\nand low levels of empathy\nand interpersonal emotions.\nBefore we begin, here's a reminder\nas to this video being intended\nfor educational purposes only.\nWe urge you not to use it as a diagnosis\nor treatment for any conditions.\nIf you feel you or anyone you know\ncan relate to these signs mentioned,\nbe sure to seek professional help.\nWith that said, here are eight signs\nyou're dealing with a psychopath.\nOne, they lack empathy.\nAccording to research at Duke University,\ncognitive deficits prevents psychopaths\nfrom experiencing automatic empathy,\nthe ability to interpret\nother people's perspectives\nsubconsciously,\neven when there's no\npersonal need to do so.\nHowever, psychopaths still\nexperience controlled empathy,\nthe ability to understand\nhow someone is feeling\nby consciously considering\nthat person's actions and reactions,\nand reasoning through their\nthoughts and feelings.\nIf someone never reacts to\nothers' tears, joy, or fear,\nunless it directly affects their goals,\nthey might harbor psychopathic tendencies.\nTwo, they don't feel guilty.\nLack of remorse is one of the\ntelltale signs of psychopathy.\nDue to their decreased automatic empathy,\npsychopaths don't process\ncare-based transgressions,\nwhere one person harms\nanother as morally wrong.\nThis lack of guilt often correlates\nto violent, illegal,\nor unethical behavior.\nAs described in a study, a\npsychopath might be someone\nwho embezzled clients' hard-earned\nsavings without remorse.\nOn average, are three times\nmore likely to re-offend\nthan people who are not psychopathic.\nThree, they're charismatic.\nPsychopaths often mimic others' behaviors\nin order to get what they want,\nsometimes adopting completely\ndifferent personalities.\nThis process is called reverse learning\nbecause instead of reacting\nto external stimuli,\npsychopaths learn how to act\nbased on people's reactions\nto their behavior.\nSo if you catch someone\nacting instead of reacting,\nit could be a sign of a psychopath.\nFour, they are fake or manipulative.\nAnother sign you're\ndealing with a psychopath\nis if they suddenly undergo shifts\nin personality and behavior,\nturning from charming and outgoing\nto threatening or violent, for example.\nThis is known as extinction.\nIn a study by Blair in 2018,\nexplains that it happens\nwhen people are no longer rewarding\none of the psychopath's behaviors.\nThey will then try a different tactic\nto try and manipulate you\ninto giving them what they want.\nFive, they lie constantly.\nPsychopaths use lies\nto get what they want.\nSince they don't naturally\nexperience empathy or guilt,\npeople on the psychopathic spectrum\nare more likely to view lying as a tool\nthan a moral exception.\nAdditionally, research suggests\nthat psychopaths are\nbetter able to detect lies,\nalthough this trait appears\nin psychopathic men more than women.\nSix, they are irresponsible.\nPsychopathy is synonymous\nwith irresponsibility.\nTheir cognitive deficits in empathy\nmean that psychopaths are\nalmost always centered\naround their personal goals\nand will sometimes do whatever\nit takes to achieve them,\nincluding breaking their promises.\nCoupled with their lack of guilt\nand moral responsibility to others,\nit is unsurprising that psychopaths\nare not the most reliable.\nSeven, they blame you for their mistakes.\nAlthough psychopaths lack remorse,\nwhen confronted with\nthings they've done wrong,\nthey may blame you.\nWhy?\nBecause they probably won't take the time\nto think through how\nplacing the blame on you\nwill make you feel the same\nway they do at the moment.\nInstead, they use you as a scapegoat\nin an attempt to relieve\nthe discomfort and anger\nthey are experiencing.\nEight, they are impulsive.\nAnother giveaway that\nsomeone may be a psychopath\nis impulsivity or high\nlevels of risk-taking.\nDo they repeatedly break laws for fun\nor because they don't feel compelled\nto uphold society's moral standards?\nAre they frequently\nengaged in reckless driving\nor drug use without fear?\nThese are examples of behaviors\nthat could be due to psychopathy.\nBecause impulsivity is also a sign\nof other personality disorders,\nbipolar disorder, or ADHD,\nit's important to consider\nthese signs' presence\nalongside other signs on this list.\nHence, it requires a detailed\nprofessional analysis.\nLooking at these signs,\nit's understandable how\npeople who rank highly\non the psychopathic spectrum\ncould pose an increased risk to society,\nbut it's also important to keep in mind\nthat psychopathy is a spectrum,\nand like other mental disorders,\nhighly stigmatized and\nmisused in the media.\nWe hope we were able to give\nyou insight into how you know\nwhen you might be dealing\nwith a psychopath.\nHave you ever seen or\nexperienced these signs\nin your daily life?\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nKnow of any signs we missed?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them.\nIf you'd like,\nfeel free to share
