    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nDo you have your eyes on\nsomeone you find attractive?\nDo you hope they'd find you\njust as appealing as well?\nThere's more to attraction\nthan simply looks.\nPersonality, values, interests,\nand more can all play into attraction.\nAre you looking for tips\non how to make yourself more desirable?\nYou've clicked the right video.\nHere are seven things\nthat will make others\nsubconsciously more attracted to you.\nNumber one, wearing sunglasses.\nWhat makes a pair of sunglasses so cool?\nVannessa Brown, a lecturer at\nNottingham Trent University,\nwanted to find just that out.\nBrown reasons that sunglasses\ncan help with an overall symmetric face,\nhiding any symmetric\nimperfections around the eyes.\nSunglasses also hide the eyes,\nwhich can make someone appear mysterious,\njust like Gojo Satoru.\nBrown explained to the cut,\n\"The eyes are such a tremendous\nsource of information\n\"and vulnerability for the human being.\"\nNumber two, being androgynous.\nAccording to a 1983 study\nfrom Dr. Linda A. Jackson from\nMichigan State University,\nthose with both feminine\nand masculine attributes\nare often rated as more attractive.\nThe study states that,\n\"Results indicated that\nandrogynous persons\n\"were favorably perceived on\nthe gender-linked dimensions\n\"of instrumentality and expressively,\n\"and in sex-neutral desirable traits.\n\"They were regarded as better\nadjusted, more likable,\n\"and as having an advantage\nin the occupational domain,\n\"compared to masculine\nand feminine persons.\"\nNumber three, being a kind person.\nIt's always a good thing\nto be kind to one another,\nbut one study from China also suggest\nthat it may just make you appear\nmore physically attractive.\nThe study had three subject groups\nexamine pictures of people's faces\nand rate how attractive they were.\nOne group was given\npersonality information\nthat was positive,\nwhile the others were giving\nnegative information, or none.\nThe group giving positive\npersonality information\nrated the faces as more\nattractive than the others.\nThe study finds that positive personality\ncan increase perceptions\nof facial attractiveness,\nand that this phenomenon of halo effect\non facial attractiveness\nhas been evidenced.\nSo while we should all\nbe kind, no matter what,\nit's a nice bonus to\nknow that it may pay off\nin more ways than we think.\nNot only will we make others feel good\nand feel healthier and happier ourselves,\nbut we may just appear\nmore physically attractive\nthan before.\nNumber four, own a pet.\nSo that pet you've always\ndreamed of adopting,\nnow is the time.\nIn 2008, two French social psychologists\ndecided to conduct an experiment.\nThey had a dashing young\nFrenchman named Antoine,\napproached 240 randomly chose a woman\nto ask for their phone\nnumber in hopes of a date.\nHalf of the women were\napproached by just Antoine,\nthe other half, well,\nAntoine approached them\nwith an adorable gray dog\nnamed Gwendu by his side.\nA small 10% of women\ngave Antoine their number\nwhen he was alone,\nbut Antoine's odds went up to 30%\nwhen Gwendu was his wingman.\nThis is likely due to the idea\nthat owning a pet shows you\ncan handle the responsibility,\nare caring, committed, and\nthe dog is just really cute,\nperhaps making you cuter as well.\nIn another research study\nled by the University\nof Nevada, Las Vegas,\nAnthropologist Peter Gray\nfound that 36% of men and 35% of women\nwere more attracted to\nsomeone who owned a pet.\nIf you adopt a rescue\nanimal, your odds only grow.\n49% of men and 64% of women\nwere more attracted to\nsomeone who adopted a pet.\nAlso, if you don't like pets,\nthe data doesn't look too good for you.\n54% of men and 75% of women\nsaid, they wouldn't consider\ndating someone who\ndidn't like pets at all.\nOpen your heart to animals, my friend.\nWho doesn't love a cute little puppy?\nNumber five,\nclearly expressing your\nemotions and observing others.\nSo, how well do you express your emotions?\nIt's been commonly known\nthat communication is key\nin relationships, so it's very important\nthat you not only express your emotions,\nbut observe how your partner\nor date is feeling as well.\nA 2016 study published in\nthe journal proceeding,\nThe National Academy of Sciences\nexamined whether people\nare attracted to others\nwhose affective behavior\nthey can easily understand.\nSo they had subjects watch\ndifferent people, experience\ndifferent emotions.\nThe results, the study\nstates that they found,\nthe better a participant\nthought they could understand\nanother person's emotions,\nthe more they felt attracted\ntowards that person.\nImportantly, these individual changes\nand interpersonal attractions\nwere predicted by activity\nin the participants reward\ncircuit, which in turn\nsignaled how well the\nparticipant's neural vocabulary\nwas suited to decode the other's behavior.\nNumber six, tilting your head.\nA 2015 study published in the\nInternational Journal\nof Behavioral Etiology\nwanted to find out if\nhead tilt and fertility\ncontributed to aspects of\na woman's attractiveness.\nThey had subjects rate\nfacial portraits of women.\nAccording to the study,\nthey found that the fertile\nphase portrait of each woman\nwas deemed more attractive\nin 56 to 62% of cases.\nWhen the portraits were\nreclassified by head pitch,\nthe more downward tilted\nportrait was preferred\nin 64 to 73% of cases.\nThey also found that\ndownward tilted portraits\nwere rated as more behaviorally alluring\nthan less downward tilted ones.\nAnd number seven, learn how\nto play a musical instrument.\nWhat's your favorite musical instrument?\nDo you plan to play?\nA 2014 research study found\nthat those who could compose\nand play complex music\nwere seen as more attractive by women.\nAccording to the lead researcher\nat the University College, Dublin,\n\"The ability to complete complex music\n\"could be indicative of\nadvanced cognitive abilities.\"\nThey go on to say that,\n\"Consequently, women may\nacquire genetic benefits\n\"for offspring by selecting musicians\n\"able to create more complex\nmusic as sexual partners.\"\nSo when it comes down to deciding\nwhich class to take next semester,\nsign yourself up for\na good old band class,\nor perhaps orchestra.\nNot only will you discover\nthe power of music,\nbut you'll be extra good looking\nwhile rocking up that concerto.\nSo, do you do any of\nthese things on the list?\nDo you think it makes you more attractive?\nShare
