    "transcript": "is it love or are you just a useful tool\nit's a terrible question to ask but a\ntruth we should all know how to look out\nfor\nadmit it we're not perfect and sometimes\nwe can be blindsided by love are you the\nonly one who gives time and emotion or\nare you only thinking that way right now\nbecause you're upset are you asking them\nfor too much or are they truly ignoring\nyou to help you answer these questions\nlet's look to see if you're in a Love\nShack or a toolbox number one\ndisinterest what was that I wasn't\nlistening\ndoes talking to them feel like you're\ntalking to a wall maybe you said you\nwere hungry and got uh-huh and nothing\nelse so you ended up eating alone if you\nfeel like they don't know anything about\nyou and aren't even interested in\nknowing about you especially if they\ncould be replaced by an abduct like a\nflower pot that says aha once in a while\nthat's most definitely not love if you\nhave a partner who suddenly stops caring\nabout this simple day-to-day things this\nis also another form of disinterest that\nwarrants a closer look ask yourself are\nyou being loved or are you just a\nplaceholder labeled partner\nnumber two when expectations go\nsupernova nuclear the legendary word\nSmith William Shakespeare even said\nexpectation is the root of all heartache\nsure we have some expectation Basics\nthat are essential like basic chores or\nbeing able to discuss matters calmly and\nthat's good\nred flag time is when those expectations\nbecome weirdly unattainable and never\ngood enough to the resentment of your\npartner it can feel like they're\nexpecting you to be some sort of wizard\nmagically able to produce whatever fancy\nthey can think of\nthis demonstrates their distorted\nunderstanding of other people reality\nand their own part in the relationship\nyou're human not a fictional character\nnumber three boundaries they see no\nstinking boundaries\nhave your loved ones trampled over a\nboundary they've clearly delineated time\nand time again perhaps you let it go\nonce or twice because they laughed it\noff as hey just try this thing it'll be\nfun or don't be so hurt it was just a\njoke looking back though you realize\nyou've already told them several times\nseriously I tried it I don't like this\nand it's not a joke yet they still shrug\nand steamroll on in the same fashion\nthey deemed their desire worth your\ndegradation\nsilence is being equivocated as\nagreement so you'll have to speak up if\nafter a confrontation the response is\nstill come on it's not a big deal or you\ndon't really care about me\nyou're not a person you're a tool number\nfour the relationship feels one-sided\nand imbalanced\nthe most important trip you may take in\nlife is meeting people halfway Henry\nBoyle all relationships have their own\nDynamics the give and take may not be 50\n50 and in fact rarely is though cleanly\nevenly split going back and forth over\ntime at the heart of it though there is\nstill both a give and take from all\nparties in the relationship\nso if the dynamic feels like only one\npartner is doing all the things whilst\nthe other sits back and merely reacts to\nwhat is handed to them it's not a\nrelationship it's a master and servant\nlook out for imbalance and goals as well\nif they're affectionate enough but are\ndisinterested or even annoyed when the\nfuture is brought up\nnumber five\neveryone and everything owes them one\ndoes not get something for nothing and\nyet this person seems to expect exactly\nthat you hear them rant about owed\nprivileges recognition and rewards yet\nyou know they haven't done a single\nthing to earn them\nif you're with someone like that chances\nare they believe that this is how\nrelationships work too\njust for the honor of being with them\nyou're expected to love them and do\nanything and everything they desire\nwithout them lifting a finger to give\nlove back\nnumber six relationships are meant to\ngrow evolve and mature you may settle on\na type of Rhythm but you're always\nfinding a renewed hope and pleasure in\nyour time together\nif the relationship doesn't even reach\nthat point or stays immature start to\nquestion what exactly is happening after\nover a decade of living together and\nyou've been trying to discuss marriage\nwith someone since year two if on your\n11th anniversary you get a little\npromise ring it's time to have a serious\nsit down\nIf instead of growing and maturing you\nfind that it's only their bad habits\nrubbing off on you and you're learning\nnothing they might simply be keeping you\nstagnant so they have an excuse to not\ngrow either number seven navigating a\nMinefield is easier than talking to them\ncan you talk to your partner about\nanything or is it more likely that your\ncomment means the spikes come out and\nthey go Defcon 1 on you if you share of\nfrustration about the relationship and\nthey dismiss your feelings maybe even\nclaiming you're defective in some way or\nthat you're too sensitive what they're\nreally saying is I don't want to take\naccountability for anything they're\nusing you as the scapegoat for all their\npoor behaviors enabling their ongoing\nlack of effort in maturing and number\neight they act differently behind closed\ndoors\nthis one is distressing because your\nfriends and family think this person is\nso wonderful so good for you because in\nfront of them this person is wonderful\nto you your family and friends just\ncan't imagine that once the door to your\nhome closes your wonderful partner whips\noff the facade revealing the\ncondescending dismissive overly critical\nGoblin underneath\nyou're being used as a prop in public\nthis jekyllhyde partner is using you to\nenhance their self-esteem by boosting\ntheir Public Image if you feel used it's\nworth the time to analyze why you feel\nthat way it might be due to a transient\nmoment or bad day but it could also be a\nsignal for you to care for yourself and\nlook at repeated Behavior\nif you do come to the conclusion that\nyou're being used perhaps speak with\nyour partner about it and pay careful\nattention to what happens next\nis it a misunderstanding are they\nremorseful have you noticed something\nyou're doing yourself\nrelationships are a very complex dance\nbut remember it's always between\nindividuals not a person and a tool did\nany of these remind you of something or\nsomeone\ndo you recognize any of these points\nfeel free to discuss and share catch you\nnext time"
