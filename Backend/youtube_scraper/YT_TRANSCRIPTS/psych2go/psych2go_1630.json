    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers,\ndo you feel distant from\nyour emotions, thoughts,\nsurroundings, and memories?\nThis is part of something\ncalled dissociation.\nDissociation is a defense mechanism\nwhere you unconsciously push away\nconflicting or threatening emotions\nand compartmentalize feelings\nso that you don't have to deal with them.\nWithin the umbrella of\ndissociative symptoms,\nthere are two that help\ncategorize the experience,\ndetachment dissociation\nand compartmentalization dissociation.\nDetachment dissociation\nrefers to feeling like\nyou have been taken out of your body.\nCompartmentalization\ndissociation refers to when\nyour mind pushes aside distressing\nmoments or experiences,\nthis usually results in memory loss.\nWith that said, here are five signs\nyou may be experiencing dissociation.\nNumber one, memory loss.\nMemory loss is a common\nsymptom of dissociation.\nYou may find yourself at work or school,\nbut unable to remember how you got there.\nMemory loss is one of the\nquickest symptoms to identify\nbecause it's obvious.\nThe main reason memory loss\ngoes hand in hand with dissociation\nis because your brain cannot handle\nwhatever is going on,\nso it switches to autopilot.\nDissociation pulls you\noutside of your body,\nhence it's difficult for you to remember\nwhat happens around you\nif you're not there.\nBut these moments of\ndissociation don't always occur\nwhen we are frightened or distressed,\nthey could sometimes happen\nwhile you're doing something.\nNumber two, derealization.\nDerealization is another\nsymptom of dissociation,\nit sometimes feels like a dream\nwhere things are\ncolorless, dull, or blurry.\nDerealization is distressing\nand can cause anxiety,\nbut it's common for those\nwith anxiety, depression,\nand other mental illnesses.\nHowever, derealization differs\nfrom other psychotic disorder symptoms\nin the sense that there\nis a degree of awareness,\nyou are aware of reality\nand the feeling that\ndistances you from it.\nNumber three, feeling lightheaded.\nThere are many reasons why\nyou may feel lightheaded,\nbut in the context of mental health,\ndissociation can be a cause.\nWhen lightheadedness is paired\nwith another one of the\nsymptoms mentioned above,\nthen the cause is most\nlikely dissociation.\nThe vestibular system is a sensory system\nresponsible for spacial awareness\nand sense of balance,\nhowever, when you dissociate,\nyou are not aware of your surroundings.\nWhen you come to\nthe sudden realization\nof your surroundings,\nthere's almost a vestibular simulation\nand makes you lightheaded.\nNumber four, not feeling pain.\nAnother sign of dissociation\nis not feeling pain.\nThere is research suggesting\nthat dissociation not only\nminimizes painful memories,\nbut also the physical\npain attached to them.\nHowever, the connection\nbetween dissociation and pain\nis not solely related to trauma.\nPeople who experience chronic pain\ncan also experience dissociation.\nFor some who experience dissociation\nas a result of a mental health condition,\nthe feeling of not feeling in your body\ncan sometimes lead you to self injure.\nAlthough it makes sense to do something\nto bring you back into your body,\nself injuring is not the best option.\nAnd number five, a loss of self identity.\nAnother aspect of dissociation\nis depersonalization,\nit's similar to derealization in the sense\nthat you feel like you\nare watching yourself.\nHowever, depersonalization\nmakes you feel distant\nfrom your mental process,\nyou feel that you are an\nobserver of your own life.\nDepersonalization can\noccur with other symptoms\non this list,\nit can be a very scary feeling,\nlike you don't have any\ncontrol of your body.\nSome clinicians believe that\nextreme stress or trauma\ncan produce depersonalization.\nSo, do you relate to any of these signs?\nDissociation can be frightening\nand, in some cases, intrusive.\nIt's not like a physical illness\nwhere a diagnosis and treatment\nare administered via exams,\nbut there is treatment,\namong them being\npsychotherapy, medication,\nfamily therapy, and clinical hypnosis.\nIf you experience any of these symptoms,\nplease reach out to\na medical health\nprofessional for treatment.\nPlease like and share this with friends\nthat might find some good\nadvice in the video as well.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand we'll see you next time."
