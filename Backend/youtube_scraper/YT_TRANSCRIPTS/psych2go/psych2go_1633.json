    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nThanks so much for your support.\nLet's begin.\nAre there certain statements or words\nthat trigger you or completely\nrub you the wrong way?\nIn general, everyone hates\nhearing, \"Just calm down,\"\nor \"You're being too sensitive.\"\nNobody want to feel like\nthey're being irrational,\nregardless of your personality type.\nBut, what especially triggers\nthe perceptive, empathetic INFJs?\nHere are seven things you\nshould never say to an INFJ.\nNumber one, \"You're too sensitive.\"\nHave you ever felt really down or upset\nand just needed a listening ear?\nDuring moments of sadness,\nan INFJ wants to have\ntheir feelings accepted\nwith understanding and comfort.\nThe last thing an INFJ would want\nis to have their feelings challenged\nand dismissed by someone\nthey're confiding in.\nIf you tell an IMFJ,\n\"You're too sensitive,\"\nthis downplays and\ninvalidates their emotions.\nThey might choose to\navoid you in the future\nand turn to someone else\nwhen they're going\nthrough something heavy.\nNumber two, \"Let's wing it.\"\nDo you enjoy having everything in order\nand are not very flexible\nor willing to adapt?\nINFJs thrive on following\nthrough structure.\nThis could be attributed\nto the INFJ's desire\nfor perfectionism and control.\nBut nonetheless, an INFJ\nis much more comfortable\nmaintaining order over\nhaving to face uncertainty\nwith no back-up plan.\nNumber three, \"You should\nbe ashamed of yourself!\"\nAn INFJ absolutely hates\nletting others down,\nand when they've disappointed someone,\nit stings, really bad.\nBeing told that they should\nalso be ashamed of themselves,\nstares up all sorts of negative\nemotions within an INFJ.\nThis causes inaction and doubtfulness.\nIf you want your INFJ to feel\nat peace and be productive,\npractice kindness, patience,\nand provide constructive\ncriticism for them,\nrather than a pointed finger.\nNumber four, \"Here's some advice.\"\nHave you ever just wanted\nto vent about your problems,\nbut then been handed unsolicited advice?\nWhen feeling upset or facing a problem,\nThe INFJ is not looking for\nsomeone to fix their problem.\nSince they are serious thinkers,\nthey've already spent a lot of time\ncoming up with different\nsolutions for themselves.\nAt the end of the day,\nthey just want someone to\nlisten to their problems\nand be there for them.\nNumber five, \"I've had it worse than you.\"\nHave you ever had someone\ndownplay your problems\nby bringing up someone\nelse's plight, instead?\nAn INFJ is acutely aware\nof how other people feel\nsince they absorb other\npeople's emotions like a sponge.\nWhen an INFJ is going\nthrough something bad,\nthey might need comfort and understanding\nand they don't like to be told that,\n\"So-and-so has it way worse\nthan you do right now.\"\nThis invalidates their feelings\nand diverts the attention away from them\nand what they're trying\nto talk to you about.\nConsolation and support\nare a much better way\nto relate to them and help them out.\nNumber six, \"Can you be more practical?\"\nAn INFJ is not the most\npractical personality type.\nThey have a harder time navigating\nthe physical world around them\nbecause they can easily get\nlost in their own heads.\nAnd INFJ has a very vivid imagination\nand mentally likes to explore\nwith the different ideas,\ntheories, and visions\nrunning through their minds.\nPracticality does not\ncome easily to an INFJ,\nso telling them are asking\nthem to be more practical,\nwill do more harm than good.\nAnd number seven, \"But that's\nhow we've always done things.\"\nINFJs are not blind followers.\nThey oversee and critique things,\nregardless of age or custom.\nAn INFJ is not willing\nto compromise their ideas\nin order to fit in a company,\norganization, or club.\nINFJs thrive in coming\nup with new solutions\nand angles to problems.\nSo, if the environment is\nagainst any proposal of change,\nthe INFJ will become uninspired\nand seek out another avenue and people\nthat are more willing to\naccept their flow or change.\nAre you and INFJ or do\nyou know someone who is?\nWhat are your thoughts on these phrases?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nDon't forget to hit the subscribe button\nfor more Psych2Go videos,\nand thanks for watching.\nWe'll see you next time."
