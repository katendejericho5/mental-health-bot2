    "transcript": "- [Announcer] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nBefore we start,\nwe would like to thank\nyou all for the support\nthat you've given us.\nAs you know, Psych2Go's mission\nis to make psychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that.\nSo thank you.\nNow, back to the video.\nHow attractive do you think\nyou seem to other people?\nAre you insecure about\ncertain parts of yourself?\nEveryone has their own\ninsecurities about themselves,\nand may fear how it may\ncome off for other people.\nBut you never know, those very\nsame qualities in yourself\nthat you're insecure about\nare traits that some people\nmay actually appreciate,\nand find attractive.\nWhile there's certainly\nsome truth in the saying,\nno one can know you better\nthan you know yourself,\nwhen it comes to attractiveness,\nsometimes we just can't tell\nbecause we're so hard on ourselves.\nTo help you with that,\nhere are eight flaws that\nactually make you more attractive.\nNumber one, you're shy.\nDo you speak in a soft voice,\nbut prefer to keep quiet most of the time?\nAre you the type to duck your head,\nor fidget when people look at you?\nWhile you may have a\nhard time believing this,\nthere are actually a\nlot of people out there\nwho find shyness an\nattractive trait to have.\nIn a world where sociable, talkative,\ntake charge types of people\nare all clamoring to be\nthe center of attention,\nthere may be something refreshing\nabout being with someone\nwho likes to listen,\nmore than they like to talk.\nAfter all shy, people are\noften seen as more mysterious,\nintriguing, and down to\nearth compared to others.\nNumber two, you're clumsy.\nAnother trait that some\nfind surprisingly attractive\nis clumsiness.\nIn fact, psychology says\nthat men in particular\ntend to find clumsiness\nin women to be attractive,\nnot only because it makes\nthem seem more genuine,\nyouthful, and excitable,\nbut also because it\nmakes them feel needed.\nClumsiness also makes people\nfeel compelled to approach you,\nand to help you out when you're in a rut.\nAccording to statistics,\nonly a small percentage of\nyou who watch our videos\nare actually subscribed.\nSo if you haven't,\nand at the end of the video\nyou enjoy what you see,\ndo consider subscribing.\nIt would help a lot\nwith YouTube's algorithm\nin promoting more of our\nmental health content.\nThanks for being here.\nNumber three, you're easily embarrassed.\nDo you often get flustered\nwhen people tease you,\nor get embarrassed when\nyour friends poke fun at you\nfor something?\nDo you tend to blush, squeal,\nor cover your face when this happens?\nWhile this may seem like\na flaw to some people,\nbeing easily embarrassed\nis quite an attractive trait\nto others, especially to men.\nSimilar to the previous point,\npeople who are easily\nembarrassed seem more genuine\nbecause they don't try to\nhide their true feelings.\nNumber four, you're nerdy.\nThose who get called nerds, or geeks,\noften get a bad reputation\nfor loving something deeply.\nBut what's so wrong with that?\nWhether it's comic books,\nanime, video games,\nBroadway musicals,\nor some other obscure interest\nnot a lot of people can relate to.\nBeing a nerd isn't something\nyou should be ashamed of.\nIn fact, there are some\nwho find nerds attractive\nfor the very same reasons\nthey're criticized for.\nThey're driven, excited,\nand most of all, passionate\nabout the things they enjoy.\nNumber five, you're too honest.\nDo you always say what you mean?\nTo those who are tired\nof listening to everyone,\ntelling them what they want to hear,\nit can be nice to have someone\nwho always tells the\ntruth, no matter what.\nBeing honest can be a\nvery attractive trait\nbecause it means that you're\nnot going to waste their time\nby beating around the bush,\nor by playing mind games with them.\nDespite how difficult it may be,\nyou are able to just come out,\nand say what they need to hear.\nNumber six, you're an oversharer.\nOh, I shouldn't have said that.\nSorry, I've been talking\nand sharing so much.\nDoes this sound like you?\nWell, the good news is,\none of the silver linings\nto being an oversharer\nis that it makes you seem\nmore sincere and approachable.\nWhile some may prefer a mystery,\nthere are those who like it\nwhen someone is an open book.\nThis may be because your openness creates\na comfortable environment\nfor them to open up,\nand to share things about themselves\nthey don't usually share.\nIt makes it easier for them\nto develop closeness and\nintimacy in a relationship.\nNumber seven, you take things slow.\nDo you always take a long\ntime making decisions\nbecause you tend to overthink things,\nand focus on all the details?\nDo you always have a lot\ngoing on in your mind?\nYou're probably a deep thinker,\nand the type who likes\nto observe the situation\nbefore forming an opinion.\nUnlike those who are\nalways craving excitement,\nor chasing one thrill after\nthe other in their lives,\nyou appreciate and savor the\npeace and quiet in your life,\nand prefer to take your time with things,\nand to people who feel the same way,\nthis can be a very\nappealing quality to have.\nAnd number eight, you crave support.\nAs humans, it's normal to\ncrave affection from others,\nthough it's true that sometimes\npeople who openly desire\nwarmth, sympathy, and\nencouragement from others,\ncan be a bit off-putting at times,\nand especially when they\nseem too needy, or desperate.\nThere is something nice\nabout being with someone\nwho makes you feel needed,\nwhether it's kind words, sweet gestures,\nthoughtful gifts, or\nsimply time and attention.\nHaving a partner who\nwants and asks for support\ncan be a very attractive quality.\nDid you find any of these\nsurprising, or insightful?\nLet us know in the comments
