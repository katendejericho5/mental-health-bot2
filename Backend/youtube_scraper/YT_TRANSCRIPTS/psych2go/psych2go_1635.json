content.\nThanks for being here.\nHave you ever had a new friend\nor a close family member\nyou didn't feel safe around?\nDo they make you feel uneasy?\nAn unsafe person can turn\nout to be anyone in your life\nand generally, your gut will know about it\nbefore maybe even you do.\nWhat exactly is an unsafe person though?\nAn unsafe person is anyone\nwho makes you feel unsafe\nphysically or emotionally.\nThey might be verbally\nor emotionally abusive\nor tactful and manipulative.\nA relationship with an unsafe\nperson can feel one sided,\ndraining and toxic.\nDo you think you might have\nan unsafe person in your life\nbut wanna know for sure?\nWhen you're aware of the signs\nthat you're dealing with an unsafe person,\nthis can help you set healthy boundaries\nin your relationships\nand can also help you protect yourself.\nSo here are five signs you're\ndealing with an unsafe person.\nNumber one, they use\ndishonesty to their advantage.\nIt's not uncommon for\nan unsafe person to lie\neven over small, insignificant matters.\nUnsafe people frequently\nlive without hesitation.\nThey may have made empty promises to you\nor lied their way out of a conflict\nor lied to you so they\ncould manipulate you\ninto doing what they want.\nThey may also make up\nthings about themselves\nto keep up appearances in front of you.\nWhen confronted about these lies,\nan unsafe person may choose to continue\nto drag out their lies\nin order to avoid being caught red handed.\nWhen you notice someone is\nbeing dishonest with you,\nit's not something to be ignored.\nA lack of honesty in a\nrelationship is unfair\nand should be addressed.\nNumber two, they don't\nown up to their faults.\nBeing at fault definitely isn't\nsomething that's favorable,\nbut it happens to the best of us.\nIt can make you feel embarrassed,\nashamed, and uncomfortable,\nbut even so these feelings\nshouldn't serve as an excuse\nto avoid taking accountability\nfor something you've done wrong.\nAn unsafe person avoids owning\nup to their wrongdoings.\nThey might pinpoint the blame\non others, refuse to apologize\nor fail to acknowledge their faults at all\nbecause of their self-centered nature.\nDealing with an unsafe person\nwho demonstrates these tendencies\nmay be difficult to confront\nbecause changing old habits is not easy,\nespecially for someone\nwho doesn't want to.\nWhen addressed, they can become defensive\nand quick to turn the\nconversation into an argument.\nNumber three, they refuse to\nwalk in another person's shoes.\nIt's very likely for an unsafe person\nto think only about themselves\nwith little to no regard for others.\nWhen it comes to someone else's wellbeing,\nthey may choose to turn a blind eye\nor fail to recognize\nhow that person may feel\neven when they're the reason\nfor someone's low spirits.\nThis might stem from their\npoor ability to self-reflect\nand practice sympathy.\nUnsafe people may do things\nthat disrespect your boundaries\nand not see anything wrong with it.\nThey'll invalidate your\nstruggles by telling you that\nthey have it worse and\nwanna humiliate you.\nNumber four, they purposefully\nhumiliate and shame you.\nThere are many ways an unsafe\nperson can humiliate you.\nThey might joke about your\ninsecurities around other people\ncompare you to someone else\nor thoughtlessly spread\nsecrets that you've told them.\nIt can feel like your\nhumiliation and shame\ncan be for their own benefit sometimes.\nAn unsafe person often fails\nto consider your feelings and\nemotions without acknowledging\nhow their actions affect you,\nleaving you feeling\nmistreated and hurt by them.\nAnd number five, they demand your loyalty.\nUnsafe people want your utmost loyalty,\neven if they don't reciprocate it.\nThey might expect you to fully trust them.\nIf they jumped off a cliff,\nthey'd want you to follow right after.\nAn unsafe person may guilt you\ninto making you feel like you owe them\nas a way to gain control over you.\nThis is especially common\namong unsafe parents.\nA parent who is unsafe,\nestablishes a clear difference\nin power or hierarchy\nbetween them and their child,\nwhere their child stands\npowerless beneath them.\nIf you find that you\nhave an unsafe parent,\nyou may relate to hearing\nthem use the excuse\nthat since they gave birth to you,\nyou owe them for your existence.\nUnsafe people who demand your\nloyalty without earning it\ndisplay toxic behavior\nand should not be allowed\nto take advantage of you.\nDid any of these signs remind\nyou of anyone in your life?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nWe hope this video was able to help you.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nThe studies and references used\nare listed in the description below.\nDon't forget to hit the subscribe button\nfor more Psych2Go videos\nand thank you for
