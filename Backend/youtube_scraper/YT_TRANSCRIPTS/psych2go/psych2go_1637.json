all\nabout mental illnesses online\nand how it affects people,\nbut then you find yourself\nat a loss for the signs\nand what to look out for\nin those who may be experiencing symptoms\nof mental illness.\nYou might be wanting to help a friend\nor are worried about them, but\njust don't know what to do.\nSo if you want to be more\ninformed about the warning signs\nof a mental illness, here are\neight early warning signs.\nBefore we begin,\nwe would like to mention\nthat this video was created\nfor educational purposes only,\nand is not intended to substitute\na professional diagnosis.\nIf you suspect you may have\na mental health condition,\nwe highly advise you to seek help\nfrom a qualified mental\nhealth professional.\nNow let's begin.\nNumber one, excessive fear or anxiety.\nDo you tremble at the thought\nof doing a presentation?\nWhether it's a fear of going\nout, a phobia of heights,\nor anxiety talking to people,\nextreme mood swings or persistent anxiety\ncan be a warning sign of a mental illness,\nsuch as depression or bipolar disorder.\nThis kind of fear may be persistent\nand at times it may not even\nhave a particular trigger.\nYou may experience physiological\nsymptoms, such as fatigue,\nfeeling tense, shaking, or trembling,\nor gastrointestinal irritation.\nCognitive behavioral therapy\nis one way that may help you\nmanage your anxiety and fears.\nNumber two, social withdrawal.\nHave you been canceling\nall your plans recently?\nPerhaps you've just been\nfeeling exhausted lately\nor have no interest to\nsocialize and meet other people.\nLiving with a mental illness is difficult\nas it can often rob\nyour desire to be around\nor interact with others.\nThis may lead to a habit of withdrawing\nand isolating yourself from\nyour friends or family,\nwhich may worsen your mental well-being.\nIf you experience social avoidance\nas a cause of a mental health illness,\nyou may find it helpful\nto work with a therapist\non techniques to help you\ncope with this anxiety,\nsuch as through meditation,\nmindfulness and deep breathing exercises.\nNumber three, changes in\nsleeping or eating habits.\nAre you having sleeping problems?\nAccording to a 2005 study\nconducted by Strine and Chapman,\nsubjects who experienced\nsleep insufficiency\nreported mental distress,\ndepressive symptoms,\nand physical pain.\nAlthough we have much\nto learn about the exact\nneurological connection between\nsleep and mental health,\nscientists, physicians,\nand therapists have come to understand\nthat it is vital to your health.\nSleep is a regenerative\nperiod for your body,\nas it enables you to think,\nlearn and process emotions better.\nSimilarly, appetite of response can change\ndue to a mental health issue.\nDuring a mental health episode,\nemotional turmoil can\ncause people to overeat\nor avoid eating altogether.\nNumber four, difficulty\nperceiving reality.\nHave you experienced any hallucinations?\nAnother early warning\nsign of a mental illness\nis a difficulty perceiving reality.\nThe symptoms can range from delusions,\nmaladaptive daydreaming to auditory\nor visual hallucinations.\nDifficulties in perceiving reality usually\nis a precursor for psychosis,\nwhich is a disruption between\nhow your brain processes\nthe world and the\nnarrative inside your head.\nThose with bipolar disorder\nor schizoaffective disorder,\noften experience psychotic episodes.\nSeeking early medical\nattention might be beneficial\nin preventing the psychosis\nfrom getting worse.\nA professional may suggest talk therapy\nor cognitive behavioral therapy\nas the most preferred form of treatment.\nNumber five,\nincreasing inability to\ncope with daily problems.\nAnother early warning sign\nis an increasing inability\nto cope with daily problems.\nDespite the ambivalent research available,\nsome studies point to low stress tolerance\nas part of the cost,\nthough there is no definitive way\nof measuring distress tolerance.\nIt is safe to say that\nmarkers of distress,\nsuch as irritability,\nare present during or\nbefore a mental illness.\nThere are a number of\narticles regarding the links\nbetween stress and mental illness.\nA 2010 study found an\ninteresting connection\nbetween prolactin,\nstress, and mental health.\nAlthough the research\nfocuses on schizophrenia,\nit can also apply to\nother mental illnesses.\nThe interesting thing about prolactin,\nis that it is regulated by dopamine,\nwhich is another hormone.\nLow levels of dopamine can\nbe a sign of mental illness,\nbut it can also be a cause of stress.\nCombined with prolactin,\nit can lead to more stress\nwhich can cause or exacerbate\na mental illness.\nHowever, because stress and mental illness\nhave overlapping symptoms,\nresearchers find it\ndifficult to figure out\nwhich came first, the\nstress or the illness.\nNumber six, a drop in overall performance,\nas a result of stress and poor sleep.\nAnother sign of mental illness is a drop\nin overall performance.\nThis symptom can look like an\ninability to complete work,\nbut it can also look like choosing\nto neglect your personal well-being,\nsuch as foregoing personal hygiene.\nPerformance is not always work-related.\nMental illness can lead\nyou to perform poorly\nin your own life,\nor you may procrastinate more often,\nhave difficulty getting up in the mornings\nand even experience depersonalization.\nNumber seven, unexplained\nphysical symptoms.\nDo you bounce or skip when you're excited?\nOr perhaps you tense\nup when you're afraid.\nLike how you physically\nmanifest your emotions,\nmany mental illnesses also\nhave physiological symptoms.\nSome physical cues include\nheadaches or migraines, fatigues,\ndigestive issues, and muscle soreness.\nRecently,\nthere has been a lot of\nresearch linking chronic pain\nto mental illness.\nOn a neurological level,\nthe neuro-transmitters\nspecifically serotonin,\nnorepinephrine and dopamine\nare implicated both\nin pain control and other\nfactors to take into account.\nThere is no doubt that chronic pain\nand mental illness are connected.\nHence you may wanna be more mindful\nif you find yourself experiencing\nunexplainable physical pains or aches.\nAnd number eight, unhealthy\ncoping mechanisms.\nLastly, a warning sign of mental illness\nis having unhealthy coping mechanisms.\nSome frequent examples of\nunhealthy coping mechanisms are,\nsubstance abuse, impulsive\nshopping, alcoholism, or cutting.\nYou may engage in these behaviors\nin an attempt to manage your symptoms.\nHowever, there are healthier alternatives,\nsuch as meditating, journaling,\nand exercise that may\nprove to be a better way\nto help you cope.\nNot all mental illnesses are the same.\nThey all have varying criteria\nand present their own set of challenges.\nIf you or somebody you know suffers\nfrom any of the symptoms mentioned here,\nplease seek professional help.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto
