being here.\nHow're you doing?\nLike, how are you really doing?\nIn these trying times,\neveryone is struggling with\nsomething behind the scenes,\nwhether it be mental health difficulties,\nfinancial problems,\nrelationship struggles,\nor school issues.\nLife can feel so difficult sometimes.\nIn perspective, life is really short\nconsidering we spend about 26 years\nof our entire life sleeping.\nSo how do we make the most of life\nknowing the uncertainties?\nYou have to ask yourself,\nwhat does it mean to live a full life\nand how can I achieve this?\nHere are eight habits that can help you\nlive your best life.\nNumber one, take care of\nall aspects of your health.\nDo you eat a well-balanced diet?\nWhile maintaining all\naspects of your health\nmay seem tedious, in the long run,\nyou'll be happier and healthier.\nPut in a little time and effort every day\nto take a walk, eat some\nfruits and vegetables\nor take some self-care time\nto help prevent dealing\nwith health problems\nlater on in life.\nAfter all, prevention is much cheaper,\nless stressful, and overall healthier\nthan trying to treat any symptoms.\nKnowing this, try to get into\nthe habit of treating yourself\nwith the same love and care\nyou treat those you love with.\nNumber two, self-reflect.\nHave you tried journaling before?\nIf so, how was it?\nAnd did you enjoy it?\nMany people don't like to journal\nbecause it seems too time-consuming\nor they feel pressured\nto have the prettiest,\nmost expensive supplies.\nHowever, what's really important\nis taking the time for self-reflection.\nWhether it be by jotting\ndown your thoughts\non a scrap of paper or\nrecording a voice memo.\nTaking even five minutes\na day for self-reflection\ncan help you immensely.\nIt allows you to figure out your values,\nwhat you truly like and dislike,\nand learn from past experiences.\nSo try to figure out\nwhat reflecting methods\nwork best for you and\nbe authentic about it.\nNumber three, maintain social connections.\nDo you make it a habit to\nprioritize social connections?\nWhile it's hard during a pandemic,\nit's more important than ever.\nEveryone needs a support system\nno matter how independent\nor introverted they may be.\nTry to make it a habit to\nmaintain social connections\nwith friends and family,\neven if it's simply a quick conversation\nonce every few weeks.\nIt'll help you lead a\nbalanced well-rounded life.\nAfter all, your ups and\ndowns are meant to be shared\nwith people who love and care about you.\nNumber four, focus.\nHave you ever tried to multitask?\nWhile it's tempting to do so,\naccording to a study\nby Stanford University,\nmultitasking is one of the\nbiggest myths out there.\nIn reality, your brain\ncannot properly do two things at once.\nInstead, it switches between them rapidly\ngiving the illusion of multitasking.\nYou'll end up taking\nthe same amount of time\nor longer to do the tasks\nwith a significant decrease in quality.\nThis means you should\ntry to get in the habit\nof focusing on one thing at a time.\nIf you're doing work,\nshut off the television.\nYou'll likely end up doing\nhigher quality work faster.\nOnce the work is done,\nyou can fully enjoy your show afterward.\nNumber five, live in the moment.\nWhen something exciting happens\nis your first instinct\nto take your phone out\nand snap a picture?\nMany people claim they do this\nso they can look back on\nand remember fond memories.\nHowever, which is really going\nto bring you more enjoyment,\na photo or fully experiencing moments\nwith your friends and family?\nIn the end, your thoughts and emotions\nare likely going to give you\nmore enjoyment and fulfillment\nthan trying to take a\nphoto for social media.\nWith this in mind,\ntry to put your phone away\nand truly enjoy the people\nand experiences you get to be a part of.\nNumber six, manage your inner critic.\nDo you have a little voice\nin the back of your head\ntelling you that you're not good enough,\nyou're gonna fail or you're\nnot attractive enough?\nThere is a lot of pressure to be flawless\nbecause we see perfection\nfrom social media around us everywhere.\nThis can lead to low self-esteem\nand a constant feeling\nof not being enough.\nWhile it can be hard to fix\nthe root cause of low self-esteem,\nyou should try to recognize\nwhen you're being too hard on yourself.\nIf you can get into the\npreemptive habit of realizing\nwhen your inner critic is\ngetting the best of you,\nyou can break the thought pattern.\nTry to remember that no one is perfect\nand that's what makes people\nso uniquely beautiful.\nNumber seven, complain less.\nWhat's the worst day you've ever had?\nAt the end of it, did you let it all out\nand have an hour-long rant session\nwith a friend or family member?\nComplaining can be stress-relieving,\nbut if it gets out of hand,\nit can end up doing more harm than good.\nFor example, by complaining\nabout something you can't change,\nyou're giving it more\npower to ruin your day.\nAlso, you're more likely to be resentful\nand hold grudges against people\nyou may not even see again.\nThis extra burden can weigh you down\nwithout you even realizing it.\nInstead, try to let go of\nthings you cannot change,\nespecially past experiences\nyou didn't learn anything from.\nRemember that at the end of the day,\ncomplaining too much\ndoesn't make you happier,\nso why waste time on it.\nAnd number eight, don't\nbe afraid to take action.\nWhat's something that\nyou've always wanted to do?\nMany people are afraid to try new things,\nwhether it be fear of failure,\nthinking it's already too late,\nor not being able to find the time.\nHowever, there really is no better time\nto take action than the present.\nYou can't assume you\nwon't be good at something\nunless you try.\nAnd even if you want the best,\nthe most important thing is to\nhave fun and enjoy yourself.\nIt's never too late to try something new.\nSo try to make time to do something\nyou've always wanted to do.\nDo you think you'll try to\nimplement some of these habits?\nEven though we can't fully\ncontrol what happens to us,\nwe can at least have\npositive growth mindsets.\nIf you try your best to\nmaintain healthy habits,\nchances are you'll end up\nliving the best life you can.\nAnd in the end, that's all we can do.\nSo you don't have to\nworry about being perfect\nor trying to control everything.\nDoing your best is enough\nand you are enough.\nDo you think these habits\nwill help you in life?\nIf so, how and which ones?\nFeel free to comment down below\nwith your suggestions,\nexperiences or feedback.\nIf you enjoyed this video,\nfeel free to share it with friends\nthat might find insight\nin this
