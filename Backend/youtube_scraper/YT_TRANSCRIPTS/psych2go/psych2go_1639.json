Welcome back.\nDo you feel lost or stuck in life?\nIt's normal to feel uncertain sometimes,\nlike you've run into a wall\nand have no idea where to go next.\nPerhaps you're feeling tired\nof the everyday hustle.\nMaybe you're faced with a\nhuge life-changing decision\nor you could just be experiencing\nsome good-old burnout.\nFeeling stuck often comes\nwith feelings of dissatisfaction\nwith where you're at in life,\ndemotivation, discomfort,\nand doubtfulness.\nThese complex and often confusing emotions\ncan take away the enthusiasm\nof waking up to a new day every morning\nand make you feel like\nyou've lost your purpose\nor direction in life.\nSo if you've been feeling stuck lately,\nknow that you are not\nalone in feeling this way.\nAnd that there may be\nsome things you can try\nto help you move forward again.\nNumber one, be proactive\ninstead of passive.\nIt can be easy to feel stuck\nwhen you're passively\nwatching your life go by\ninstead of actively doing your best\nto take control of it.\nAlthough it may feel easier to sit\nwith this uncertainty.\nDoing so is not quite the\nsolution to overcome it.\nEscaping this trapped feeling\ncan only come if you put\nin the necessary efforts\nto improve the necessary\nareas in your life.\nWhen you feel stuck,\nput yourself in the driver's seat\nwhere you truly belong.\nUltimately, the first step\nto overcoming feeling stuck\nin life is to have the willpower\nto establish sustainable\nchanges and goals,\nwhich can give you the motivation\nto get that engine started again.\nNumber two, let go of your\ninner fears and limitations.\nHave your fears stopped you\nfrom pursuing what you really want?\nWhether it's a fear of failure,\nnever-ending chase for perfection,\nor a need to be validated\nby others to feel worthy,\nthese fears and limitations\ncan be overwhelming\nand get in the way of\nyour plans and goals.\nThis is why it's important\nthat you identify\nand confront these setbacks\nso you can come to understand\nwhere they come from\nand how you get over them.\nLetting go of your inner\nfears and limitations,\nno matter how big or how small they may be\ncan help greatly empower you to be able\nto reach for your true desires in life.\nNumber three, stay true to yourself.\nAre you living your life for\nothers instead of yourself?\nThis can especially happen\nif you're taking on too\nmany responsibilities.\nPerhaps you're taking\nup a job for the title,\ninstead of the experience,\nstudying something your\nfamily wanted you to do\nor being dragged to events\nor activities you have\nno personal interest in.\nIf you find yourself\nfeeling trapped doing things\nthat feel uninteresting and\nmore like a waste of time,\nit may be time for you\nto prioritize what is\nmost important to you.\nThis may mean reflecting on your values,\nyour goals and your desires,\nand determining the areas in your life\nthat are not necessarily\nhelping you stay true to them.\nNumber four, change things up a bit.\nAre you tired of waking up\nto the same old schedule every day?\nClinical psychologist and author,\nLisa Firestone, states in her article\nwith Psychology Today that\nthis is because when we fall\ninto a routine, we're\noften choosing a pattern\nof behavior that feels\nself-proactive and familiar.\nTo protect ourselves\nfrom anxiety and pain,\nwe subconsciously design a\nset of structured behaviors\nto help us navigate the world.\nSo introducing new activities\nor reinventing your regular schedule\ncan serve a great deal\nin reviving and refreshing your mindset.\nThe little changes you\nmake to your routine\ncan add up to a big difference over time.\nThis could be as simple\nas putting your phone away\nto enjoy some quality\ntime with your family,\ntaking a different route\non your way to work\nor waking up five minutes earlier\nto practice some mindful\nmeditation in the morning.\nAnd number five, create an action plan.\nLast, but most importantly,\ncreate a solid action plan.\nWhen you feel like you're\nrunning into a wall\nin one aspect of your life,\nyou have other aspects\nor areas in your life,\nwhich you do have control of,\nat least to some extent.\nFive yourself something to look forward to\nby creating a personalized goal system\nthat can accommodate\nyour needs and desires\nso you can continue to grow\nand develop in a positive way.\nAnd when you set your goals,\nyou could try following\nthe SMART goal setting\nso that your goals are\nspecific, measurable,\nachievable, realistic and timely.\nThis gives you a much higher chance\nin successfully accomplishing them.\nAnd allowing yourself time\nto find your natural\nflow again is important.\nLife has its many\nunpredictable ups and downs\nbut you can still continue to do your part\nand staying to stay a\ncouple of steps ahead\nof the game with some\nstrong goal setting skills.\nDid you find these tips helpful?\nLet us know which tips you'll
