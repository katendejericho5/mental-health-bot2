judge their worst\ntraits or mistakes too harshly and\ninstead hope that our love friendship\nand understanding will change them for\nthe better but how do we know when to\ndraw the line that someone has gone too\nfar or that we forgiven them for too\nmuch at what point can we say that a\nfriendship has turned toxic\nwell if this is something that's been\nnagging you for a while now here are six\npsychology bagged signs from experts\nthat you're in a toxic friend group lack\nof trust and\nsupport according to psychologist Dr Ben\nmicheles toxic friend groups cultivate\nan environment of distrust and sabotage\ninstead of supporting each other like\ngood friends should they instead gossip\nabout one another backstab each other\nand betray each other's confidence these\ntoxic friends use their secrets against\none another silently judging or mocking\neach other and will often gang up on\nsomeone instead of trying to help or\nunderstand them constant criticism while\nit's true that Honesty plays an\nimportant part in cultivating healthy\nand lasting relationships the intention\nbehind this honesty is important too\nsays psychologist Dr Elizabeth Lombardo\nbecause that's what separates\nconstructive criticism telling someone\nwhat they need to hear from harsh\njudgment blunt honesty meant just to\nhurt them so so if your so-called\nfriends often belittle you and make you\nfeel inferior with their backhanded\ncompliments and thinly veiled passive\naggressive comments then the\nrelationship has most likely turned\ntoxic unhealthy competition although\nsunu famously said keep your friends\nclose and your enemies closer be wary of\npeople who don't know how to tell the\ndifference according to therapist Dr\nJanet brdo unhealthy competition is\nrampant in toxic friend groups toxic\nfriends will constantly compare\nthemselves to one another and belittle\nor try to one up each other's\nachievements instead of celebrating and\nbeing happy for your success like a good\nfriend should their tendency is to feel\nthreatened so they may retaliate by\nfinding some way to put themselves back\non top either by finding some way they\nmay be better than you or rubbing your\npast failures and shortcomings in your\nface before moving on to the next Point\ndon't forget to subscribe and show\nsupport by liking our Channel together\nwe can raise awareness and make a\npositive\nimpact manipulation and control\ndoes it seem like your friends are\nconstantly playing mind games with you\nor each other do you even get the\nfeeling that they may want to manipulate\nor control you according to Dr Lombardo\ntoxic friend groups often try to control\nor manipulate one another they may try\nto exert their influence by coercing you\ninto doing something you don't want to\ndo by guilt tripping shaming or\nintimidating you into silence or having\neveryone else turn against you when you\ndisagree with them and if you're not on\nthe receiving end of it you're an\naccomplice\nand you might not like yourself very\nmuch when you do it negativity and drama\ntoxic people thrive on conflict and\nnegativity says relationship therapist\nNicole arst so being in a toxic friend\ngroup can feel a lot like going on an\nemotional roller coaster there's always\na lot of drama going on and every Mo\ngets turned into a mountain these people\ntend to focus too much on the negative\nand their misery loves company it's\nemotionally draining to even be around\nthem and they're constant complaining\nand arguing\nlack of boundaries respecting one\nanother's boundaries is key to a healthy\nand Lasting relationship so when your\nso-called friends constantly disregard\nyours it's a definite red flag toxic\nfriendships are often one-sided says\ntherapist Karina iar Jacobs and they\nwant to get so much more than they give\nthey demand that you be there for them\nwhenever they need it but can't be\nbothered to reciprocate they may also\nbecome unreasonably possessive of you\nyou can't have other friends invade your\nprivacy where were you why didn't you\ntell us and want to spend more time with\nyou than you're comfortable with you\nshould cancel that thing to hang out\nwith us or why do you need to be alone\nanyway don't you want to be friends\nanymore so do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here if this\nvideo has made you realize that you may\nbe stuck in a toxic friend group it\nwould be good for you to re-evaluate\nyour relationships and consider seeking\nhealthier connections although repairing\na toxic friend group is possible\neveryone needs to do their part and put\nin effort otherwise you're better off\nprioritizing your own well-being and\nsurrounding yourself with more positive\nfriends who uplift and support you so\nwhat are your thoughts on this video let\nus know in the comments below and\nremember Psy toor you matter"
