    "transcript": "(calm music)\n(eye chimes)\n- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nHave you ever wished you\ncould feel what others do?\nYou could comfort and\nunderstand what people\nare going through better,\nso what's not to like?\nDid you know there are actually\npeople who can do this?\nThey're called empaths and they can feel\nother people's emotions\nas if they were their own.\nTheir highly perceptive\nand sensitive nature\nmakes them some of the most understanding\nand compassionate people out there.\nBut there are some drawbacks\nto being an empath.\nEmpaths struggle with a lot\nmore than some may realize.\nAre you curious as to what\nthese difficulties are?\n(gentle chime)\n(calm upbeat music)\n(calm music)\nWell, here are six struggles\nonly genuine empaths will understand.\nNumber one, being highly\nsensitive to other's emotions.\nPicture this, you're having\nthe best morning so far.\nYou had a delicious breakfast\nand are ready to conquer the day.\nThen, someone having the\nworst day of their lives\nwalks into the room.\nYou can practically feel their\nannoyance from a mile away,\nand it rubs off on you.\nYour nice day immediately turns sour\nand you just can't bounce back.\nEmpaths are highly sensitive\nto how others are feeling.\nThis means someone else's\nbad mood affects you as well.\nAnd you can't simply\nstop feeling that way.\nThis heightened sensitivity\nleads to emotional burnout\nand being mentally overwhelmed.\nYou often struggle to\nseparate your emotions\nfrom someone else's leaving no\nemotional space for yourself.\nSo while experiencing what\nothers feel sounds great,\ndon't forget, you need\nto practice self-care\nand relaxation as well.\nNumber two, needing alone time.\nDo you love being around\nothers all the time?\nWith your great people skills,\nit sure sounds logical.\nHowever, empaths need a\nlot of alone time as well.\nConstantly feeling other's\nemotions without any check\non when, where, who, or to what extent,\nbeing with people all the\ntime can get exhausting.\nYou need alone time to\nrecharge and process everything\nthat goes on in your mind.\nMost people think you're\nbeing rude or avoidant,\nbut it truly isn't personal.\nAt the end of the day, empaths\ndeserve as much patience\nand understanding as they give others.\nNumber three, people\ntaking advantage of you.\nDo you often feel like you\ncan't say no to someone?\nWhether it be peer pressure\nor trying to avoid disappointing someone,\nsaying no can be hard.\nWhen it comes to empaths, saying\nno is especially difficult.\nYou can feel the other\nperson's frustration and worry\nwhen the request isn't met,\nwhich can lead to major guilt.\nMany empaths are happy to help,\nboth in order to avoid this guilt\nand simply because you understand\nthe request is important.\nHowever, this compassion\ncan lead to getting taken advantage of.\nSome people ask for too\nmuch without considering\nthe other person's feelings and limits.\nEmpaths are some the\nkindest people out there,\nbut everyone has boundaries\nthat deserve to be respected.\nNumber four, knowing\nwhen someone is not okay.\nHas a close friend ever\nlied about being okay?\nCould you tell?\nBecause empaths are highly\nsensitive and intuitive,\nyou generally know when someone is lying,\neven without being best\nfriends beforehand.\nThis may sound like a great thing,\nbut it has some drawbacks as well.\nBeing the only person who can\ntell when someone isn't okay\nis a lot of responsibility.\nAn empath may feel accountable\nfor making them feel better,\nwhich can take away from your life.\nIt can be a great task to find the balance\nbetween respecting other's\nboundaries and trying to help.\nThis makes being an empath very difficult.\nSo if you are one, you\nshould try to remember\nthat no one person is obligated\nto make everyone else happy.\nYou need to prioritize yourself as well.\nNumber five, being\nlabeled as too sensitive.\nHave you ever been called\ntoo sensitive? If so, why?\nMore often than not,\nbeing called too sensitive\nis simply someone else trying\nto excuse their bad behavior.\nBy shifting the focus onto\nyou, they can make it seem\nas if you're in the wrong when you aren't.\nEmpaths tend to care a lot,\nsometimes over things that may\nnot be a big deal to others.\nThis means you're often called\ntoo emotional or hypersensitive.\nIn reality, you simply\nhave a lot of compassion\nand care for the world around you,\nwhich definitely isn't\nanything to apologize for.\nMore power to you.\nAnd number six, violence\nis deeply upsetting.\nWhen you hear something\nhorrible on the news,\nhow does it affect you?\nAre you worried and upset\nfor the rest of your day,\nor do you compartmentalize it?\nWhile this isn't true of all empaths,\nsome get deeply distressed when\nthey watch anything violent.\nWhether it be a horror movie or the news,\nyou may simply get overwhelmed\nby the rush of negativity.\nIt can be hard to explain\nthis to non-empaths,\nbut at the end of the day, your feelings\nand preferences deserve to\nbe respected no matter what.\nBeing an empath has both\ngood and bad aspects.\nIt's unfair to think empaths\nare fortunate and always happy\nwithout being aware of\nthe downsides as well.\nThey deserve as much love and\ncare as they give to others.\nAre you an empath?\nIf so, did you relate to\nthese struggles? Which ones?\nFeel free to comment down\nbelow your experience,\ninput or suggestions.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with those out there\nfiguring out the empath rule book.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nAnd as always, thanks\nso much for watching."
