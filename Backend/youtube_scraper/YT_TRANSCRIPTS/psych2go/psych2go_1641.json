friend\nwho always cancels plans last minute?\nSome people may feel that this is rude.\nHowever, this might be a sign\nof social anxiety disorder,\nnot rudeness.\nEveryone experiences some\nlevel of social anxiousness\nat one time or another,\nbut those with social anxiety disorder\nexperience above average levels of worry,\nfear and panic in social situations.\nBefore we begin this video is\nfor educational purposes only,\nand is not a substitute\nfor professional guidance,\nadvice, treatment, or diagnosis.\nIf you relate to this video,\nwe advise you to consult\na mental health professional for help.\nTo raise awareness about social anxiety\nlet's look at 10 signs it's\nsocial anxiety not rudeness.\nNumber one, struggling\nto make eye contact.\nOften people with social anxiety disorder\ndescribe looking someone in the eyes as\n\"Anxiety provoking and uncomfortable.\"\nThis is likely due to genetic wiring.\nPeople diagnosed with\nsocial anxiety disorder\nhave a pronounced fear\nof direct eye contact.\nIf you have social anxiety,\nthe part of your brain\nthat warns you of danger can\nbe triggered by eye contact.\n- Number two, not eating\nfood because they're afraid\nit may get stuck in their teeth.\nDo you have a fear of\neating in front of others?\nSome questions that may run\nthrough your head include\n\"What if I spill my food or drink?\nWhat if I choke or draw\nattention to myself?\"\nThe fear of eating in front\nof others can interfere\nwith your social life\nand even school or work.\nSocializing usually includes\nsome form of food or drink.\nBusiness meetings sometimes\ntake place over lunch or dinner.\nSchool cafeterias can be crowded.\nFear of eating and\ndrinking in front of others\ncan be triggered by a wide\nvariety of situations.\nFoods, and dining companions.\n- Number three, canceling\nplans last minute.\nDo you or someone you know\nfrequently cancel plans last minute?\nYou may become sucked\ninto a cycle of anxious,\noverwhelming thoughts, and\nback out at the last minute.\nFor example,\n\"What if my friends think\nI'm boring or awkward?\"\nAccording to a licensed\npsychotherapist in Hoboken,\nNew Jersey, Courtney Glashow, LCSW,\nfound that these\noverwhelming anxious thoughts\ncan be challenged\nusing cognitive behavioral therapy.\nIt helps to reframe your worrying thoughts\nso that you feel more at ease\nabout interacting with other people.\nNumber four, shutting\ndown in a group setting.\nDo you remain silent in group settings\nbecause you're afraid you'll\nbe judged about what you say?\nWhen you suffer from social anxiety\nyou tend to avoid social situations\nand shut down in a group setting.\nYou shut down not because you're rude,\nbut because of the intense\nfear of embarrassment.\nPeople without social\nanxiety usually brush off\nan awkward social moment and move on.\nHowever, when you make a\nmistake in a social setting,\nyou spend days or even months replaying\nthe mistake in your head.\nNumber five, having an\noutburst over something\nothers consider small.\nDo you sometimes find yourself\nhaving an angry outburst\ntowards something only mildly irritating.\nThose with social anxiety may\nhave difficulty falling asleep\nor staying asleep and\nbecome sleep deprived.\nOver time, lack of sleep\ncan trigger individuals\nto become more sensitive to small problems\nand quick to anger, yelling\nat the dog for barking,\nbecoming angry in traffic,\ngetting upset because of a\nlong line at the grocery store,\nor lashing out over an honest mistake\nare all small triggers that\nturn into monumental challenges\nfor an individual who is\nstruggling with social anxiety.\nBeing mindful of anger\noutbursts by keeping a journal\nand taking time to reflect\non why this anger occurred\ncan often help individuals\nrealize their anxiety triggers.\nNumber six, being glued to\nthe phone or social media.\nDo you pull out your phone anytime\nyou're around people you don't know?\nPhones or social media are a distraction\nthat those with social\nanxiety frequently use\nto take their mind off\nof overwhelming thoughts.\nYou may feel like everyone is judging you.\nSo taking out your phone distracts\nyou and helps you escape.\nNumber seven, struggling to open up\nand have a deeper conversation.\nUnderlying social anxiety disorder\nis the fear of being scrutinized, judged,\nor embarrassed by others.\nYou may be afraid that people\nwill think badly of you\nor that you won't measure\nup in comparison to others.\nTherefore, you'll struggle to open up\nand have a deeper conversation.\nEven though you probably realize\nthat your fears of being\njudged are somewhat irrational\nand overblown, you still\ncan't help but feel anxious.\nNumber eight, leaving a party early.\nDo you always worry that\nyou'll embarrass yourself\nor people around you might\nbe embarrassed by you?\nPeople with social anxiety\nmight be intimidated\nby the idea of parties\nbecause they overthink\nabout how others are scrutinizing\nand judging them harshly.\nAnd because of this,\nthey're easily drained\nby interactions with other people.\nNumber nine, appearing\ntense in group settings.\nDo you often feel awkward\nor tense in a group?\nPeople with social\nanxiety disorder realize\nthat their level of fear is excessive,\nwhich can cause individuals\nto fear being judged\nor rejected for appearing\nanxious, blushing, sweating,\nor coming across as incompetent or boring.\nThis may lead to avoidance\nof social situations\nor enduring them with a sense of distress.\nNumber 10, creating a\nfalse time constraint.\nDo you come up with false\nexcuses to leave early\nfrom a social interaction so\nthat you don't feel stressed?\nSomeone with social anxiety may create\na false time constraint to\navoid social interactions\nand to ensure that they\ndon't feel trapped in them.\nDoes this sound like you?\nDo you find yourself\ndoing any of these signs?\nSocial interaction can be\nstressful and draining,\nbut they'll always be a part of life.\nYou can use various coping methods\nand slowly come out of your comfort zone.\nBut you don't have to do it alone.\nIf you or your loved ones\nexhibit any of these signs\nplease consult a mental\nhealth professional for help.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with
