    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nHas a guy ever confessed\nthat he's had a crush on you\nwhile you never even had a clue?\nDo you have a close guy friend\nthat everyone says has feelings for you,\neven though you think he\njust sees you as a friend?\nIs there someone special you like\nbut you just can't seem to figure out\nhow he feels about you?\nIf you answered yes to\nany of these questions,\nwell, you're certainly not alone\nbecause when it comes\nto understanding guys\nand their feelings,\na lot of the time, they\ncan be hard to read.\nSo if you really want to know\nhow a guy feels about you,\nhere are eight signs\nthat can help you figure\nout when a guy likes you.\nNumber one, he sends you\na lot of nonverbal signs,\nwhether it's his body\nlanguage or his tone of voice.\nPay close attention to how\na guy acts when he's around.\nMost people often knowingly\nsend a lot of nonverbal signs and signals\nthat communicate their\ntrue feelings towards you.\nDoes he lean in closer\nwhen you talk to him?\nIs he always trying to\nsit or walk beside you?\nDoes he often mirror your\nactions and gestures?\nPsychology says\nthese are all common signs\nof romantic attraction\nalong with mutual eye contact,\nplayful touching, or\nself-conscious behaviors\nlike grooming or fidgeting.\nNumber two, he spends\na lot of time with you.\nIf a guy secretly has a crush on you,\nthen he'll constantly be\nlooking for ways to see you\nand spend more time with you.\nThey'll often come up to talk to you,\ntext you a lot, and invite you to hang out\nor do things with them.\nBut some guys might be too shy\nto initiate conversations with you,\nespecially if you don't know\neach other that well yet,\nand might just try to run into you\nor bump into you some more\nand hope that it leads to something more.\nNumber three, he never talks\nabout other girls around you.\nDo you think a guy in your life\nmight have some feelings for you?\nWell, here's one good way to know.\nThink back to the last few conversations\nyou've had with him.\nHas he talked talked about\nor mentioned other girls around you?\nIf the answer is no,\nthen that's probably because he likes you.\nHe's careful not to talk\nabout other girls around you\nunless someone else brings it up\nbecause he doesn't want you thinking\nthat he's interested in anyone else.\nNumber four, he asks\nyou a lot of questions.\nWhen a guy likes you,\nhe might pay special\nattention to you and only you.\nHe asks you a lot of personal questions,\nwants to get to know you better,\nand listens to you attentively\nwhen you're talking to him.\nThey might even ask you about\nyour relationship status\nor what kind of guys you like.\nAt the very least,\nit means he enjoys talking to you\nand thinks you're fun and interesting.\nNumber five, he subtly\ntries to impress you.\nAs cliche and outdated as it may seem,\nsome guys will try to win\nover the girl they like\nby finding ways to impress her,\nwhether it's with his\ntalent, intelligence,\nstrength, or good looks.\nWhy?\nBecause according to\nevolutionary psychology theories,\nwe often want to appear our\nbest, most desirable selves\nin order to entice\npossible romantic partners\ninto pursuing a relationship with us.\nSo next time you're with a guy,\ntry to see if they're making an effort\nto look nicer for you, or seem cooler,\nfriendlier, smarter, or funnier.\nSpeaking of which, that\nbrings us to our next point,\nnumber six, he's often protective of you.\nYou may notice him acting\nmore protective towards you\nthan his other friends.\nSay, for example, always\nwalking you home at night\nor staying by your side\nin a crowded space.\nIt likely means he sees\nyou as someone he values\nand wants to protect.\nNumber seven, he's always\nsmiling around you.\nWhile you might dismiss a guy's smile\nas a sign that he's simply in a good mood,\npsychology says it's worth\ntaking a second to notice,\nespecially if he seems\nlike he's always cheerful\naround you in particular.\nDoes he smile at you in a\ngreeting every time without fail\nor laugh a lot when you're around?\nDoes he seem to perk up\nthe moment he sees you\nor have a positive change\nin mood when talking to you?\nPay close attention to\nhow he acts around you\nand compare it with how he\nacts around other people.\nIf you notice he seems happier\nand is always smiling around you,\nthen that could be a\nsign that he likes you.\nAnd number eight, he's always\ntrying to make you smile too.\nFinally, when a guy likes you,\nnot only will he be laughing\nand smiling around you,\nhe'll always try to make you smile too.\nMost guys try to crack a few jokes,\ngoof off, or tease the girl\nthey like to make her laugh,\nwhile others might shower\nher with compliments\nor thoughtful little gifts.\nEither way, when a guy seems\nto constantly be doing things\nto get your attention and\nput you in a good mood,\nthen that might be a sign that\nyou've already won his heart.\nSo did anyone in particular come to mind\nas you were reading this list?\nTalk about your experiences\nin the comments below\nor read some of our audience's stories.\nDo you think any of these signs\nbrought you some new insight?\nFeel free to comment down\nbelow
