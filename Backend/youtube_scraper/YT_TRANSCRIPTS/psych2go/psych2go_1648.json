    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psych2Go'ers,\nwelcome back to the channel.\nIs it only substances that are toxic?\nMm, sometimes relationships too.\nA toxic family is one\nthat thrives on behaviors\nin relationships which\ninfiltrate negativity\ninto every part of your life,\nbecoming detrimental to mental, emotional,\nand even physical health.\nTherapist, Dr. Claire Jack says,\n\"Despite the abundance of love,\n\"some have grown in\nfamilies which are bound\n\"by a web of abusive, critical,\nand manipulative behaviors.\"\nWould you like to know more?\nWhat are the telling factors,\nhow to tell the difference?\nHere are six telltale signs\nthat you are indeed living\nin a toxic environment.\nNumber one, they don't allow you\nto express your individuality.\nWhat defines family?\nA place where you can feel\nfree to express opinions,\nhave disagreements, and be respected\nfor the choices you make.\nComing from a family excelling\nin a certain profession,\nhow would they react if one day\nyou were to voice out your\nopinion of embarking on\nan opposite career path?\nWould they respond with something like.\n- [Family Member 1] You\nwon't be good enough.\nAnd you would earn less\nthan the rest of us.\n- [Narrator] Well, when a\nfamily regards your future\ncareer choice as a serious\nthreat to your family's way\nof doing things, you're forced\nto question your abilities,\nand whether this was\nsomething that you could do\nas part of this family.\nA toxic family completely\ndemolishes the autonomy\nof the members, leaving\nno room for mistakes.\nA healthy family accommodates\nchange and growth,\nboth of individuals and\nof the family as a unit,\nembracing all new additions too.\nNumber two, there's always\nsome drama going on.\n- [Family Member 2] I heard\nyour friend, Kay, got an A\nfor her math exam.\nWhy can't you obtain the same grade?\nWhat's wrong with you?\n- [Family Member 3] Even\nyour twin sister got an A\non that exam.\nWhat's the matter with you?\nWhy can't you be more like your sister?\n- [Narrator] Ever heard\nthese types of snippets\nin your surroundings?\nToxic parents exhibit a\nchronic lack of empathy\ntowards their children,\nsays Shannon Thomas,\ntrauma therapist, and author\nof \"Healing From Hidden Abuse.\"\nA supportive, loving\nfamily made discuss you\nwhen you're not there, often to see how\nthey can help you out.\nThe toxic family spends\ntime gossiping about you,\nand your other siblings.\nThe gossip is often unpleasant in nature,\naimed at bringing you down.\nBeing nasty about family\nmembers to other family members\nis at the heart of any toxic families.\nNumber three, you're\nasked to lie about things\nthat happened at home.\n- [Family Member 2] If\nyour teacher asks you\nabout the bruises on\nyour arm, say that you\nbumped hard into the table.\n- [Narrator] The mother\nwarns her eight-year old son\nwhile adjusting his school neck tie.\nYet another hushed conversation\ncommon in such households.\nAbuse within families can\nrange from emotional abuse\nto physical and sexual abuse.\nWithin the toxic family, abusive\nbehavior is not called out\nfor what it is.\nOn the contrary, you may\nbe made to feel that you\ndeserved to be abused.\nYou may be told to keep\nquiet about the abuse\nin order to preserve the\nreputation of the family.\nThe abuser is protected within the family\nand allowed to get away\nwith their behavior.\nNumber four, they exert\ncontrol and autonomy over you.\nEver had a conversation that goes?\n- [Family Member 4] Can I\nplease go on a picnic trip\nwith my friends next month?\n- [Family Member 3] No, you can't.\nYour final school examination\nis just around the corner.\n- [Family Member 4] But I\npromise to study my hardest\nafter the trip.\n- [Family Member 3] No, you can't go.\nTrust me, it's for your own good.\n- [Narrator] These\nconversations are typical,\nwhere the parent demands blind\nobedience and conformity.\nIt is highly advisable to\napply a moderate amount\nof behavioral regulation\nand monitoring for children.\nA study even relates enforcing boundaries\nand monitoring associated\nwith positive outcomes.\nBut on the contrary,\nwhen the control is at an extreme level,\nthe negative behavior\nand psychological impacts\nweigh heavily on children.\nA study reports feelings of\nincompetency and low self-worth\nare common among these children.\nNumber five, they don't recognize\nyour space or boundaries.\nAre they constantly checking your phone\nwithout asking for your permission?\nHaving your own boundaries and space\nis definitely crucial in healthy\nparent-child relationships.\nThe situation asks for\nassertiveness and compassion.\nBeing assertive involves\nstating how you feel\nand what you need without\ntrying to hurt the other person.\nThis includes maintaining eye contact,\nmaintaining a sense of calm,\nbeing open to having a conversation,\nactively listening to the other person,\nand monitoring your tone.\nAt the same time being\ncompassionate means understanding\nwhere your parents may be coming from,\nand understanding the difficulties\nthey may be experiencing\nin making sure you grow into a good person\nwhile also simultaneously\nhonoring your needs.\nA study shows practicing\ncompassion helps you stay grounded\nand come from a place of\nlove, versus defensiveness.\nAnd number six, they'll\nconstantly belittle you.\nIs talking smack about\ntheir kids the go-to topic\nat the adults table?\nToxic family members will\nconstantly belittle you,\nessentially implying that\npretty much anything you say\nthat expresses your ideas, beliefs,\nor wants is silly or stupid.\nThe problem is they're not kidding.\nAnd that's why what they're\ndoing is not a joke.\nPsychologist, Dr. Thomas L.\nCorey, suggests being open\nto them about how this hurts you,\nsaying that it can help counteract this.\nIt's imperative to\nrepeatedly let them know\nyour side each time it\noccurs, so they might see\nthe error of their ways.\nHowever, a notable exception,\naccording to Dr. Thomas,\nis there should be\na zero tolerance policy\nfor physical abuse.\nYou may have experienced some,\nif not all, of these behaviors.\nHopefully, in a mild form,\noccasionally in your relationships.\nAnd that's the key word, occasionally.\nWhat distinguishes a toxic relationship\nis both the severity of these behaviors\nand how frequently they occur.\nIn a toxic relationship,\nthese behaviors are the\nnorm, not the exception.\nThe toxicity is clearly\na matter of degree.\nMost of us manipulate once\nin a while, play helpless,\ninduce guilt, et cetera.\nWe're not perfect, nor\nare our relationships.\nPlease remember your toxic\nsurroundings are not your fault.\nAnd there is no shame in\nreaching out for help.\nThis can help improve both\nyour life and your family's.\nDo any of these describe your experience?\nLeave a comment down below\nabout your encounters with them,\nif you'd like.\nPlease feel free to share any\nthoughts you have as well.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like\nbutton, and share it\nwith those out there
