to work for 50 60 years\nand then retires and dies i thought that\nwas how everyone lives and there's\nnothing wrong with that\nat all i just didn't know that there\nwere any other ways so\nit didn't feel like i powerfully chose\ninto it from a place of confidence from\na place of knowing myself it was just\nlike\nthis path that was given to me and i\njust decided that was my\npath until i start

saying that i'm\nconfident you guys have committed to\ntrying this\non um you know trying on this identity\nfor the next 60 minutes and also\nhopefully trying on these other ideas\noutside of this\nbox here and by the way you guys if you\nguys are joining right now you are\nhere at psych2go we have just hit by the\nway\n6.35 million or something 6.3 million\nsubscribers\nso on behalf of psych2go can i just take\na moment to say\nwe love you guys so much we're\nso freaking grateful for you guys and\ni'm so honored to be here my name is\nyuri choi i'm so honored to be here to\nserve you guys today\nso that we can all become like 5\n50 100 more confident in the next 50\nminutes\nokay cool cool cool cool you guys all\nright so let's go into number one\ni'm gonna do this even more with you\nguys right now you know it's interesting\nbecause i work with a lot of\num you know my clients who um one of the\nmost powerful shifts\nthat they experience in my coaching\nprograms is that they\nfeel really really powerful and really\nconfident at the end of the three months\nso i've been thinking i've been picking\nup on some of these things like what\nwhat ignites that confidence right away\nso today i want to share some of those\nninja tips with you guys so you can tap\ninto that right now and number one\neveryone says this whenever i say hey\nwhat does it feel like for you to show\nup as your most confident self\neveryone starts with this i would sit up\ni would extend my spine\nso if you guys are crouching right now\nif you guys are\nanything but sitting straight imagine\nthat you're a\nking or a queen and you have this like\npower to govern this entire\nyou know an empire of yours\nwhat would you sit like what would you\nact like how would you extend your spine\nhow would you sit up\nand whatever that looks like in your\nmind do it\nright now extend your spine and sit on\nyour back\nso sit up straight yes\nand hold that for a second another thing\nis\ntake a deep inhale in\nfill up your lungs because that's going\nto extend your spine extend your body\neven more\nand exhale everything out and then relax\ninto that kingdom of yours the divinity\nof yours\nyes now when yes\num so i invite you to sit up straight\nuncross your legs\nplace your feet to the ground if you can\nand really just sit powerfully whatever\nthat means to you\ni know this is so simple because we\nthink confidence comes from here\nand sometimes it does but a lot of it\nyou can actually lead yourself\nwith your body as well so now if you\nguys\nare looking at the screen right now\nlet's try another body language thing\nwhich is\nimagine that you're looking at me\nstraight in the eyes\nnot like not like scary but like\nkindly hold that gaze or if you have a\nfriend or family member next to you\nand you guys are watching this together\nmaybe take a moment to just gently\nlook at each other in the eyes make that\neye contact\nand can you feel\nthat connection because confidence\nreally comes from that deep sense of\nconnection with ourselves\nand with others when we get to feel\ncomfortable in ourselves and again it\ndoesn't have to come directly for our\nmindset first\nsometimes we can lead ourselves there\nwhat would a confident person\nbe like act like and you get to play\ninto that today right now\nas if you're playing a role as if you're\nplaying a role in a play or a movie\nand your role is to play a confident\nrole\nconfident version of yourself so then\ndo you guys feel that just by sitting up\ni want to hear from you guys how do you\nfeel\njust by sitting up extending your spine\nreally relaxing your shoulders away from\nyour ears some people say oh this\nseems like yoga what is sort of yoga\nbecause yoga is really tapping into\nthe most divine version of ourselves so\ntoday we're\ntapping into the most you know amazing\nconfident version of ourselves\ncool yes\npowerful you feel knowledgeable you feel\ncool you feel powerful you feel nervous\nthat's okay\nbut it's okay lead yourself there by\nbreathing slowly breathing deeply take a\nfew deep breaths here\nand extend your back and sit like a king\nsit like a queen you feel more relaxed\nyou feel normal you feel\ngood yes yes yes so you guys probably\nstart to feel that shift in your body\ninstantly how cool is that\nright and by the way whatever i feel\nlike a goddess i love it\num you feel empowered you feel okay but\nnot any different that's okay we're just\non number one we have nine more to go\nhow do i correct my posture sit as if\nsomeone's like\npulling you from from above like\nimagine that there's a string that's\ngoing down your spine which is your back\nand imagine that someone's like pulling\nyou up\nand just sit straight sit up relax your\nshoulders\nthere's a lot of space between your ears\nand your shoulders relax your neck\nsit with your shoulders open yes\nthat's uncomfy because you know what\nwe're stepping into a version of\nourselves that you probably haven't\naccessed in a long time and that's okay\nthis is supposed to be weird this is\nsupposed to be uncomfortable\nbecause if it was comfortable we'd be\ndoing it all the time but right now\nwe're actually tapping into that version\nof us\nthat does not feel comfortable yet\nso we get to practice into being\ncomfortable in this new state\nokay number two\nnumber two is more of a mindset as well\nas a being\naspect of ourselves number two\nwe get to be in integrity with ourselves\nand others take a moment right now\nand this is going to take you get to\ntake a really honest\nhard look at yourself and\nreally humble look at yourself\nin what ways have you not honored your\nown or\npromises with other people or\ncommitments with yourself or others\nand we're not looking at this from a\nplace of judgment\nwe're looking at it with so much love\nbecause this gives us an opportunity\nto close that gap\nintegrity means that we're being honest\nwith ourselves and others people\nand actually another definition of\nintegrity did you know is to feel\nit's a state of feeling whole and\nundivided\nand isn't that what confidence really is\nwhen we feel\nwhole when we feel enough when we feel\nyou know like we're undivided we're one\nwhole\nbeing and we can access that version of\nyou\nby closing our gap between our\nwords and our action and by staying in\nintegrity\nnow no one's perfect that's okay if you\nguys have\nlet go of a few commitments to yourself\nor to other people\nthat's okay but this is a time that we\nget to recommit\nto showing up as the most integrous\nversion of ourselves\noh how's that feeling for you guys i\nknow\nthis feels like oh i really have to look\ndeep into our\nmyself and see where i can be\nbetter that's exactly what this is\nright because\nthe reason have you guys ever felt\ntriggered or kind of got angry or\nannoyed because someone's like oh\nyou said you're going to work out why\nhaven't you worked out and you get kind\nof like\nwhy is that person calling me out isn't\nthat is that person even working out\nnow in those moments we're not feeling\ntriggered because that person\nsaid that we're actually feeling\ntriggered in those moments\nbecause we know subconsciously we\nhaven't\nhonored our own word and in those\nmoments\nwe diminish our own power\nbecause here's the thing when i say i'm\ngoing to work out tomorrow\nand i don't it honestly\ndoesn't make anyone else anyone else's\nwords less powerful it just makes my own\nwords\nless powerful right so\ntake a moment today and this is a part\nof you know what i\nwalk my clients through with love with\ngentle love and support which is like\nhow can we act our words in action right\nso share with us in the chat what are\nyou willing to recommit to in the next\nmonth you know we're going to be doing\nthese monthly live stream what are you\nwilling to close\nthe gap in for the next month have you\nbeen telling yourself you're going gonna\ndrink more water every day and you\nhaven't\nif so what do you get to recommit to do\nyou get to drink\nyou know eight glasses of water again\nokay exercise you get to recommit to\nexercising what does that look like\npost a video yeah what does that look\nlike right\nand again this isn't coming from a\njudgment\nbecause here's the thing we all have\nareas that we get to close that gap\nbut that's how we get to hone in our\npower more and more and more\nso if that makes sense for you guys\nnumber one and number two\nnumber one is getting into the posture\nextending your spine\nand getting into that version of you in\nyour body\nand acting as if you're the most\nconfident version of yourself by\nsitting up opening your shoulders number\ntwo\nis closing the gap between your words\nand your action and being in integrity\nwith yourself\nif those two things have landed for you\ngo ahead and type in\ni am whole and undivided i am whole\nand undivided let's affirm our integrity\nin this moment\ni am whole and i'm undivided\ncool um\ni am whole and i'm undivided i am whole\nand i'm undivided\nyes yes yes yes i want to be the best\nversion of me\nthat's beautiful too i'm whole i am\nwhole\nmy gosh love it\nyes and yes you are here's the thing\ni am is one of the most powerful things\nthat you can ever say in this universe\nbecause\nnow you have created this identity\nand now you're saying universe this is\nwho i am and all\nthe world is going to say is yes you are\nyes you are so all of you guys who said\ni'm whole and\nundivided yes you freaking are and right\nnow in this moment we're creating this\nnew reality because\nit actually doesn't matter who you've\nbeen for the last\nhowever many years because right now\nwhat matters is who you're gonna be\nright now\nand who you're committing to be moving\nforward that's it\nthat is it that's all that matters in\nthis moment as we move forward\ncool love it love it love it i love it\nyou guys okay\nnumber three this is also about\nbeing when you want to boost your\nconfidence like take a moment right now\nyou guys close your eyes\nthink about the best most badass version\nof yourself\nthe confident version of yourself\nwhat is that person wearing\nwhat is that person dressed like is that\nperson\nyou know look does that person look like\nthey just got out of bed\nor do they look like they got ready for\nthe day\nit has nothing to do with makeup it\ndoesn't have to do with your hair curled\njust whatever that looks like for you\nbecause because here's the thing\nwhen you dress up for you because\nyou feel good in whatever you're dressed\nin\nit starts to open up that part of you it\nstarts to activate that part of you that\nis linked to that version of you\nyes you become your words absolutely\nmodel energy i love it so here's the\nthing it doesn't necessarily mean\nthank you question i really appreciate\nyou on behalf of\nspike to go it doesn't mean that you\nhave to go buy brand name clothes\ni mean you can if you want if that's\nwhat you really want to commit yourself\nto that's\none way to do it but you don't have to\ndo that but\nokay so if there's a version of you who\nwears if someone's a burberry if that's\nthe case\ndo the clothes are clean and is it\nironed\nis that something that you can do today\num or does the person who wears that\nis that person well groomed and like\nshowered does that person get\nready in a certain way if you want to be\na model\nor that model vibe that somebody that's\nwhat somebody said then does that person\nyou know brush their hair and get ready\nfor the day\nwho do you need to compress ryan\nyourself\nand that's really the point you don't\nneed to impress anybody else\ni sometimes have days where i'm on calls\ni'm working from home\nand i have no one to see but i dress up\ni get ready i get ready for the day i do\nmy hair\ni do my makeup that's just my way to get\nready it doesn't have to be that way for\nyou\nbecause there's this energy when you're\ncommitting to\ndress yourself and impress yourself\nnobody else\nthere is this boss energy that comes\nthrough have you guys ever felt that in\nyour life\nwhere you're feeling kind of icky and\nthen you shower and you get ready you're\nlike\nwhoa i'm starting to feel kind of good\nright\nyes developing a routine is really\npowerful grace\ni completely agree with you\num i get bullied when i act or dress how\ni like everyone i know at my school\nthinks i'm a freak well guess what\nyou're different you're unique amazing\nyou know what the purse the people\naround you they're gonna\nwhen they don't feel comfortable about\nhow self-expressed you are\nhow confident you are they're gonna\nstart\nthey're gonna try to push you down\nbefore they follow you\nand so if that's the case that's okay\nbe loud and proud in your style and\nwhatever you get to dress in any way\nbecause the more you own it now if\nyou're wearing you're like asking for\nvalidation from people people can feel\nthat energy but if you wear it and you\nown it\nit's really powerful right\nyes yes yes all right you guys\nso are you guys committed to getting\nready in the morning tomorrow when you\nwake up\nwhatever that means to you can you be\nloud and proud\nyes yes absolutely\nnumber four this is something that you\nguys can do outside of this today\nwhich is writing down 25 things that you\nlove about yourself\nand or you're proud of it could be\nanything\nit could be that you you love\nyou love the way that you talk to your\nfriends\nit could be that you love the way that\nyou adopted your dog\nit could be that you love\nthat you have a great smile like\nwhatever it is that you want to notice\nabout yourself\nsit down and write down at least 25 if\n50 great if 100 even better\nas many as you can i typically have my\nclients to at least 50\nbecause in that flow of finding things\nthat we get to celebrate about ourselves\nwe start to build our self-confidence\nhere's the thing\nno one is imperfect everyone's already\nwhole everyone's\nalready undivided everyone is already\nperfect\nwith their imperfections now\nthe problem is we just forget it's not\nthat we're not amazing\nwe just have horrible memory we just\nforget to remember how amazing we are\nbecause i

things about others\nbecause here's the thing when you start\nto judge other people instead of looking\nat what's good in them\nit's actually projection of the things\nor the areas in your life or your body\nor your\nbusiness or your work that you're\nactually judging about yourself\nbecause we are all reflections of each\nother\nso when you start to genuinely\ngenuinely notice beautiful things about\nother people\nthat actually is not only a way to boost\nyour confidence but it's also evidence\nthat your confidence is already\nboosted so take a moment right now\nso many people have affirmed amazing\nthings about themselves\ntag someone or acknowledge somebody\nright now in the chat\nacknowledge someone in the chat right\nnow and say\ni hear you yes you are beautiful yes you\nare amazing whatever that is\ntake a moment right now to share that\noh never gonna give up never gonna let\nmyself down i love it princess erica\nyou are amazing hey everyone in the chat\nvery energetic crowd

do\nyou\nfeel this love because this is where\nconfidence is built\nwhen you can look at people not from a\nplace of people pleasing\nnot trying to get them to like you or\ntrying to get an outcome out of it\nbut genuinely because you look at them\nand you can look at them and say wow i\ntruly\ndeeply honestly admire\nsomething about you like you are so\nkind you are so beautiful your eyes\ntwinkle\nwhatever those things that you start to\ngenuinely notice\nand when you can connect to that place i\npromise you guys\nyour confidence will start to be boosted\nand you get to do this not because\nsure in the end the outcome is that your\nconfidence will also be boosted\nbut do it from a place of love because\nwhen you have general\nlove for humanity and yourself\nyou can't show up

guys okay let's keep going\nnumber six\nnumber six is similar to number two\nwhich is being in integrity with\nyourself which is you know closing the\ngap between your words and action\nso number six is setting a goal it could\nbe a small goal\nand actually achieving that it could be\nanything maybe you say today\ni commit to drinking 10 glasses of water\nand you achieve it and by the end of\ntoday just by achieving that\nyou're gonna feel much more confident\nmaybe your goal\nis to say i'm gonna stay on and take\nnotes and watch this stream again\nso that i can really soak in and do some\nof the homework here\nand do it by the end of the day and you\nachieve that\nsetting these small goals and achieving\nthem helps to anchor into that place\nwhere you are feeling powerful and\nconfident\nso share with us what is a goal that\nyou're going to set for the next 24\nhours\nand and achieve powerfully what is that\nfor you guys\nshare in the chat\nshare in the chat what would you commit\nto for the next\n24 hours and powerfully choose into\ncompleting it because any time we set a\ngoal and we complete it it doesn't\nmatter how small or big\nit could be that hey i'm going to floss\ntoday i'm going to\nyou know go for a long walk today\nwhatever it is\nyou're gonna commit to finding a job\nyou're gonna commit to um\ndrinking lots of water trying one new\nfood\ndrinking

a\nsmall goal it could be a big goal\nbut just by completing it i promise\nyou're gonna start to feel more\nconfident in yourself\nbecause you get to anchor into that part\nof you that is confident\nthat's able that's capable of you know\naccomplishing\nanything because if we can do one thing\nwe can do millions of things\nall right you guys number seven\nnumber seven do something

turn your\nenviousness to ambitiousness\nturn your enviousness to ambitiousness\ni'm not sure if enviousness is a word\nturn your envy into ambition i guess\nthat's better\nwhatever you're jealous or you're\nenvious about\nthink about a few things that you have\nbeen jealous of or envious about\nis somebody who is fit somebody who\nis going into this place of judgment\nabout it notice that the things that\nyou're jealous or envious about\nactually shows you what you really want\nso for example if you look at somebody\nyou're like wow i'm so envious that she\nis happy that may actually mean that you\nit's your soul trying to tell you that\nyou get to do some things\nchange some things in your life to be\nhappy like really actively not just like\nsay\ni want to be happy but like really take\nit seriously\nor if you're like wow that person is so\nfit\ni'm so jealous maybe that's actually\nshowing you\nyour your soul is saying you know what\nyou're capable\nyou're whole you can do anything you\nwant\nthis is actually your soul's way of\nshowing you\nthat that's something that you can be\nambitious about and that you can also\nbecome\nfit\nor maybe you're like i'm really envious\nthat the person is successful maybe\nthat's your inner self\nsaying hey maybe it's time for us to\ntake some massive\ninspired action because you know deep\ndown that you're capable of anything and\nanyone's ever done\nbecause yes we look at people like elon\nmusk\nand he's going to space and he's doing\nall these amazing things but\nguess what you guys he's actually not\nthat different from any of us\nyes he's a billionaire but\nhe's just a human with a soul\nhe just did things some some things\ndifferently\nwe look at all these celebrities that\nare doing really cool things that you\nmight be envious of\nthey're just another person people doing\nthings they just decided to do some\nthings differently\nyou might start to think oh well they\nwere born with this and they were going\nwith that\ni can counteract that statement with\nso many stories of people who had\nnothing and they created something\nwhich is so cool it is fair eric because\nguess what that means you can do that\ntoo\nyou can do that too and this these are\nthe moments\nthat you get to dodge a coincidence to\nthe moon that's funny\num these are the moments that we can\nstart to\nturn our envy into ambitious\nand when we allow those envious envy\nor jealousy into a place of activating\nus\nwe take our power back because we're not\nsaying\noh they can do that i can't we're saying\nthey can do that\nthey're showing me what humans are\ncapable of\nthank you and let me do that too and let\nme actually\ncreate a plan or take some actions that\nare really uncomfortable\nor start to show up more powerfully and\nconfidently um\ndo things i've never done before let's\nactually enroll into that school\nlet's actually create this meal plan\nlet's actually\nwork out every day like let's actually\ntake different actions\nand when we start to do that we get to\ntrans transmute our envy\ninto ambition and we can be anything\nthat we want\nyeah kyra it's just that my friends\naren't that real\nwell you get to you have the power to\ncreate any kind of friendships you want\nyou get to go make new friends that's\ntotally up to you\nso is this landing for you guys all\nright all right okay we're at number\nnine we're going to number 10.\nthis is so powerful\nthis is something i've done in the last\ncouple days and and so you guys\num if this is one of the sub things that\ni can talk about\nwhich can be a whole different video but\nhere's the thing\nno one's life is perfect no one is\nperfect\num i've had a couple weeks actually\nin the last couple like you know week\nand a half two weeks where i wasn't\nfeeling like my best powerful self all\nthe time\nso i had to really create a plan to say\nhow can i get back\ninto that place because i know i can\nit's not about\nbeing perfect it's about continuously\ndoing self-reflection\nand choosing into that best version of\nourselves every day and some days\nit's going to look like i'm 10 out of 10\nand some days it's gonna look a little\nbit more difficult and that's okay as\nlong as you're taking that\nsmall action so with that said\nin the last couple days what i did\nwas did extra extra self-care\nand this boosts my confidence this\nboosts my vibration\nit allows me to tap into this beautiful\nabundant\nmindset again right\nwhich is so i literally\ncleaned up my space um currently i'm\nstaying at this hotel in seoul\ni cleaned up my a hotel room and i i\ni uh made a bath for myself\nand i pretended that i was getting ready\nto create space for the most important\nguest that i'll ever have i don't know\nwho that would be\nmaybe it's like mother to be said no\nit's ela musk i don't know\nwho would come visit or\nyou know the president or you know\nwhatever whoever\nthat you think is one of the most like\nif this person is coming to visit me\ni would have to make my place like this\ndo that for you and then re-enter that\nspace\nas the most important person\nfor you yeah bts oprah\nenter the space so i i i\nmanaged to create the space as if i was\ngetting ready for the most important\nguest\ni left the room and came back into the\nroom\nas if i am that most\nimportant guest of my life because\ni am right\nbecause yes there's bts yes there's\noprah there's mike\ntyson all these people that you love but\nguess what none of those people would\nmatter\nunless you were here you mattered first\nyeah this is super powerful so you get\nto\nwalk in and\nbe the most vip guest\nof your life and notice how\ndifferent you would treat yourself if\nyou really had that mindset\ni made the bath i laid out my slippers\ni hung my um\nmy gown my uh bathrobe in like a really\npretty way um i made sure everything\nsmelled good\nand i walked in feeling like yes\nreminding myself every step of the way\ninto my room again\nwhy am i not treating myself like this\nbecause i really\nam the most important person to me maybe\nnot to you guys\nbut you are the most important person to\nyou\nright so i invite you to create that\nspace\nwhere you get to show up as the most\nimportant person for you today or\nthis week anytime and\nnotice how good you feel when you do\nthat for you\nwhen you get to take care of you and\nlove yourself this is literally\nself-love self-care\nand it's not about you know taking a\nphoto\nin your bathtub and being like oh yeah\nlike\ni'm doing self-care it's not about that\nit's actually genuinely\nfeeling like i love\nme so much because i am so important to\nme\nthat i'm gonna treat myself and it\ndoesn't have to look\nanything like how i describe maybe the\nway that you would treat\nyour most important guest of your life\nis making your favorite\ntea with so much love and then\ndrinking it maybe it's\nwriting a beautiful handwritten note\nand greeting yourself for next time you\nenter the room\nit can be in any way\nbut i invite you to try that on\nall right you guys how are you feeling\nyummy take a moment right now put your\nhands to your heart\nand say i am the most important person\nto me\nand when you make yourself the most\nimportant person to you\nother people will start to also treat\nyou important\nbecause you get to teach
