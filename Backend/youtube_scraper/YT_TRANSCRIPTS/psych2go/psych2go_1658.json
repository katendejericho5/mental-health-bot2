likely\nexperiencing how hard it is.\nHabits can drastically alter\nour lifestyle and mood.\nSo while we should always aim\nto minimize our bad habits,\nit might be a good idea\nto focus on developing\nsome healthy ones first.\nMaybe you felt depressed or lost lately,\nor maybe this is something\nyou've been struggling with for a while,\nbut by developing some healthy habits,\nyou can alter your mood for the better.\nIn fact, you're already taking a step\ntowards happiness right now\nby learning which habits to\npractice with this video.\nSo to help you develop some happy habits,\nhere are nine habits that\nkeep you mentally happy.\nNumber one, practice gratitude.\nAre you grateful for what you have?\nHow often do you express it?\nIf your answer is, \"Not often,\"\nthen you should reconsider\npracticing gratitude.\nWhy?\nOne two-part study found\nthat practicing gratitude\ncan have a strong impact on our feelings\nof hope and happiness.\nMeaning it's time to act\nlike it's Thanksgiving dinner every meal.\nThe researchers from Hope College\nfound that gratitude\npredicts hope and happiness.\nSo if we express how\ngrateful we are more often,\nit may lead to feelings of happiness.\nNumber two, give compliments.\nDid you know that paying\nsomeone a compliment\ncan really pay off?\nIn regards to your mood anyway.\nIn one study, participants\nwere randomly assigned\nto perform acts of kindness,\nacts of novelty, or no act\nevery day for 10 days.\nResearchers measured their\nsatisfaction with life\nbefore the experiment was\nconducted, and then after.\nPerforming acts of kindness or novelty\nresulted in an increase in\noverall life satisfaction,\nso go ahead and pay it forward.\nA compliment never hurt anyone.\nIn fact, it will likely\nmake you both happy.\nNumber three, experience\nand go with the flow.\nHave you ever heard the\nexpression go with the flow?\nWell, we may just have\nto take that advice,\njust in a different way than intended.\nHappy people often experience\nwhat is referred to as flow.\nFlow is a state where one is\nfully involved and absorbed\nin the present moment.\nIn this state, one possesses\nintense concentration,\na loss of self-consciousness,\nand a sense of timelessness.\nSounds pretty happy, right?\nIt may not be so easy to go with the flow\nif you don't know what drives\nyou to that emotional state,\nso one step towards experiencing\nthe flow more often:\nfind out what it is that gets you there.\nIs it your passion that gets you there?\nHanging out with your best friend?\nPlaying your favorite sport?\nWhatever it is, it's not a\nbad idea to do it more often.\nNumber four, savor the little moments.\nOne habit that can keep\nyou mentally happy:\nsavoring the little moments in your life.\nThe practice of savoring\nhas been viewed by many\nto be a way to increase happiness.\nWe can use our thoughts and actions\nto increase our appreciation\nof positive experiences and emotions,\nand the duration of them.\nWhen we do so, this is known as savoring.\nTo practice savoring,\nthe next time you\nappreciate something small,\ntake an extra minute\nto consciously acknowledge\nit and bask in it.\nDon't let these moments pass you by.\nBe aware of them.\nNumber five, exercise.\nExercise plays a factor\nin improving our\nself-esteem and happiness.\nContinuous exercise has\nbeen shown to reduce stress,\nanxiety, and symptoms of depression,\nso it's a good habit to practice.\nStart with just five minutes\na day when you wake up.\nThen when that becomes a habit,\nadd an extra five minutes.\nContinue doing so until\nyou feel comfortable.\nThe point being,\nit's easier to start with a\ngoal of five minutes a day\nthan to expect yourself to\nsuddenly exercise an hour a day.\nNumber six, get enough sleep.\nRemember those seven\nto eight hours of sleep\nyou should be getting?\nWhere'd they go?\nWhy are you abandoning them?\nSleep is extremely important\nto our mental health.\nDid you know that sleep\ndeprivation kills brain cells?\nAnd not getting Zs can impair our memory,\njudgment, and reaction time.\nSo how on earth are we\nsupposed to feel happy\nif we're so tired all the time?\nThat's why it's best to opt in\nto getting an adequate\namount of rest each night.\nTry scheduling when it's time for bed,\nand be sure to remove any distractions,\nsuch as phones, tablets, or\nvideo games an hour before bed.\nThis will give your mind\na chance to wind down.\nNumber seven, choose foods\nthat boost your mood.\nAnother habit to implement:\neat healthy foods that will\nmake you happy in the long run.\nA happy food to add to\nyour diet: carbohydrates.\nCarbohydrates release serotonin,\nwhich is the key hormone responsible\nfor stabilizing our mood\nand feelings of happiness.\nDitch deep fried foods\nas those have been known\nto make you feel down.\nInstead, opt in for high-protein foods,\nsuch as lean meat, poultry, and dairy.\nHigh-protein foods release\nnorepinephrine and dopamine,\nwhich improves our energy and focus.\nNumber eight, work\ntowards meaningful goals.\nDo you often find it hard\nto get up in the morning?\nAre you unmotivated\ndue to a lack of goals?\nOne way to improve happiness\nis to set meaningful goals.\nIf we feel our life lacks a purpose,\nwe may fall into a depressive state.\nCreate motivation to keep\ngoing by pursuing something\nthat you are passionate about.\nThen set several small goals\nas starts to getting there.\nIt's something to look forward to,\nfocused on something we love.\nAnd number nine, experience nature.\nAccording to one study,\nspending just 30 minutes or\nmore per week outside in nature\ncan help lower your blood\npressure and depression.\nAnother study found taking a walk outside\nin a green environment increases our mood\nand decreases how many\nnegative thoughts we have.\nMake sure to take your walks\noutside in nature though,\nas those in the study who\nwalked down city streets\ndidn't show any benefits\nas compared to those who walked\nin a natural environment.\nLooks like you'll be adding a nature walk\nto your habits list.\nOoh, and you'll get in your\nfive minutes of exercise too.\nSo do you have any of these habits?\nWhich ones do you want to have?\nLet us know in the comments down below.\nIf you found this video
