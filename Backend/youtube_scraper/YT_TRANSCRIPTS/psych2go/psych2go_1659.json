    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey, Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nFirst of all, we would like to thank you\nfor all the support you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to help everyone\nlearn about psychology and mental health\nin a digestible manner.\nNow, back to the video.\nDo you have difficulty\nidentifying how you feel?\nHave you been prioritizing\neveryone else's needs\nbefore your own?\nSome of these negative behaviors\nmay have been developed\nfrom your childhood experiences,\nparticularly from emotional\nchildhood neglect.\nChildren have emotional\nneeds just as important\nas other necessities,\nlike food and clothing.\nWhen a parent neglects these needs,\ntheir children may develop\ncertain negative behaviors\nthat follow them into adulthood.\nSo to help you better understand\nyour emotional health and development,\nwe've made this video\nto look at eight signs of\nemotional childhood neglect.\nBefore we begin, we would like to mention\nthat this video is created\nfor educational purposes only,\nand is not intended to substitute\na professional diagnosis.\nIf you're struggling with\nemotional childhood neglect\nor any mental health\ncondition, we highly advise you\nto seek help from a qualified\nmental health professional.\nIf you suspect you or someone\nyou know is a victim of abuse,\nplease contact the\nchildhood abuse hotline.\nThe link will be in the description below.\nPlease note that everyone\nis affected differently.\nSome people may relate to all,\nsome or different signs\nthan what's on this list.\nNumber one, you bottle your emotions.\nDid you learn to keep your emotions hidden\nin fear that it'll lead to conflict?\nOne of the biggest signs\nof emotional neglect\nis the inability to identify,\nmanage and express your emotions.\nDepending on your situation,\nyou may not have been allowed\nto express how you feel\nor have been reprimanded or invalidated\nfor feeling a certain way.\nThis can be problematic later in life,\nas keeping important emotions bottled up\nmay take a toll on your mental health.\nNumber two, you put others first.\nDo you feel that your needs\nalways come second to others?\nMaybe it seems as if you\nalways have to make sure\neveryone else is happy,\neven if it means you\nhave to settle for less.\nIf you grew up learning that\nyour feelings are invalid,\nit's easy to start neglecting yourself.\nThis habit to please\nothers at your own expense\ncan over time become very\nharmful to your mental wellbeing.\nNumber three, you struggle\nto identify your emotions.\nDo you find it difficult to respond\nwhen someone asks you how you feel?\nIf you grew up in a household,\nwhen your feelings were\nneglected by your family,\nyou may have been reinforced\nto avoid thinking about how you feel\nor believe that your\nfeelings aren't important.\nThis can affect your\ndecision-making ability,\nsince not knowing how you\nfeel about certain ideas\nin situations can make it much harder\nto navigate through them.\nNumber four, you feel broken.\nDo you feel like you lack importance\nor that your emotions are out of control?\nEmotions are important\nbecause they help guide you\nto make decisions, formulate opinions\nand influence how you\ninteract with others.\nWhen you're cut off from your\nemotions, it's easy to feel\nthat there's something\ninherently wrong with you.\nWhen you don't have\nyour feelings validated\nand when you don't learn the\nnecessary skills to identify,\nmanage, and express your emotions,\nit's easy to feel alienated\nfrom everyone else.\nNumber five, you're hard on yourself.\nDo you often get caught\nup in the little details\nand prioritize perfection?\nYou may fear rejection far\nmore than what it's worth.\nAnd part of it may be due to\nyour childhood experiences.\nIt's possible to not know the correct way\nto handle failure and imperfection\nsimply because you haven't been offered\na healthy way to learn those skills.\nNumber six, you fear dependency.\nDo you find it difficult to ask for help\nwhen you really need it?\nIf your emotional needs\nhave been neglected,\nyou may feel that asking for\nhelp is a source of conflict.\nIn the past, you may have been\nscolded for asking for help,\nand so you find it difficult\nin the present to do so.\nIt may seem easier to\nsimply do it yourself,\nhowever, this fear of dependency\nmay take away your ability\nto collaborate with others.\nNumber seven, you lack self-esteem.\nDo you always compare yourself to others?\nHaving your emotional needs neglected\nmay lead to serious consequences\nregarding how you perceive yourself.\nYou may have grown up in situations\nwhere you're constantly\npitted up against others.\nThis may result in a tendency\nto see everyone else as competition,\nwhich may lead to feelings of isolation\nas well as low self-esteem.\nIn any case, if your\nfeelings have been neglected,\nit can be difficult to\nknow that your worth.\nNumber eight, you're empty on the inside.\nCan you identify or manage how you feel?\nBeing able to regulate your emotions\nis a highly important learned skill.\nIt's easy to feel helpless\nif you've been in situations\nwhere you weren't allowed\nto develop these skills.\nYou may not be sure how\nto manage your emotions\nor what to feel and when,\nthese are troubling feelings\nthat can make everyday\nfunctioning difficult.\nEmotional neglect and\nchildhood can make it difficult\nto regulate and express\nour emotions later on.\nFortunately, there's\nalways help available.\nIf you are a child or know of one\nexperiencing any kind of neglect,\nknow that your feelings\nand struggles are valid,\nand that resources are available.\nThe Childhelp National Child Abuse Hotline\nis a great resource to reach out to,\nand we've added the link to\nit in the description below.\nIf you find this video insightful,\nlike and share this with others\nwho may find it useful too.\nDon't forget to
