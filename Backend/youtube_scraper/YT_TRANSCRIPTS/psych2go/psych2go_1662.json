    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nAre you afraid of what\nothers may think of you?\nDo you worry about whether\npeople find you likable or not?\nPerhaps you've tried to dress nicer,\nor you've tried searching\nonline for the newest trend\nto follow so others would like you more?\nWhatever the case,\neveryone has struggled with\nself-confidence before,\nand it's quite normal to want to find\nand explore ways\n(water sploshing)\nto boost up how others see you.\nAfter all, becoming a more likable person\ncan help you build stronger\ninterpersonal relationships,\nand help you give better\nand more memorable first impressions.\nSo, here are seven things\nthat would make people like you more.\nNumber one, ask questions.\nAre you the type who\nlikes to ask questions?\nOr, do you remain quiet a lot of the time?\nWell, it turns out that asking questions\ncan make you more likable,\nbecause people tend to gravitate\ntowards those who need help.\nAdditionally, it's also a great way\nto start conversations with others,\nand to break the ice with\npeople you've just met.\nBut remember not to overdo\nit with the questions,\nlike, to ask the same\nquestion again and again,\nor to ask about something you\nalready know the answer to,\nsince you may end up coming across\nas a little irritating.\nNumber two,\ngive your time without\nexpecting something in return.\nHave you ever had a friend\nwho only spends time with\nyou when they need something?\nPerhaps they only call you\nwhenever they need to ask you for a favor.\nPeople like this can come\nacross as self-centered\nand manipulative,\nbecause they'll only give\nto those who can give\nthem something in return.\nSo, when you invest time into people\nwithout expecting anything in return,\nyou'll come across as\nmore honest and genuine,\nwhich will make people\nautomatically like you more.\nNumber three, show your\nflaws from time to time.\nDo you feel closer to\npeople who make mistakes,\nas opposed to those who\ndo everything perfectly?\nPeople who show their\nflaws are more likable\nbecause it makes them more relatable.\nWhen you admit and show your\nflaws and imperfections,\nother people can feel more\ncomfortable around you,\nknowing that they can relate\nto you and your situation.\nAlso, it can give them a sense of trust,\nsince you're letting\nthem see both the good\nand the bad of yourself.\nNumber four, display positive\nemotions as much as you can.\nHave you ever noticed how the\nhappiest person in the room\ncan always make those\naround them laugh and smile?\nEmotional contagion happens\nwhen you mimic the emotions\nand expressions of the people around you.\nUsually without conscious effort.\n(bell dings)\nIt's why you might find\nsomeone's positive emotions\nto be literally contagious.\nSo, by displaying more\npositive emotions yourself,\nthe people around you may\nstart to associate you\nwith feeling happy, and\nend up liking you more.\nBut it's important to note\nthat you can't force emotional contagion.\nAnything that comes across\nas fake or insincere\nmay end up just pushing others away.\nNumber five, be warm and competent.\nIs there a person who you like very much?\nHow would you describe them?\nIf you think about it,\nmost of it may come down\nto how much you trust\n(bell dings)\nand respect that person.\nResearch done by Princeton\nUniversity psychologists\nhas shown that warmth and competence\nare directly correlated to\ntrust respect, respectively.\nShowing warmth is about being friendly,\nwhile competence comes down\nto knowledge and confidence.\nSo, for the next time you are\nabout to meet someone new,\nremember to be more friendly\nand just share what you know,\nand you'll be a step closer\nto getting them to like you more.\nNumber six, care about people, truthfully.\nHas anyone ever set aside\nwhat they were doing\njust to help you out?\nDid you find yourself\nliking them a bit more?\nPeople tend to like and gravitate\ntowards those who show\ncare and kindness to them.\nWhen you put aside your\nown tasks for someone else,\nyou're showing them\nthat you genuinely care\nabout their wellbeing.\nHowever, while it's\nsometimes good to prioritize\nthe needs of others before\nyour own, it's also important\nyou don't forget to take\ncare of yourself as well.\nAnd number seven, have a\npositive body language.\nWhat type of body language do you put out?\nDo you tend to cross your\narms and shrink into yourself?\nBody language can\ninfluence your likeability.\nA positive body language includes smiling\nto bring about trust,\nkeeping your chin angled down,\nto avoid giving the impression\nof looking down on people,\nand keeping your palms\nup as you're talking\nto show others that you\nare open to their opinions.\nNeuroscience research has\neven found that smiling\ngives the brain as much pleasure\nas 2000 bars of chocolate, or $250,000.\nSo body language can not be overlooked\nwhen trying to be more likable to others.\nWhile there are benefits\nto being liked by others,\nit's important to remember\nnot to fake your actions.\nSo try to avoid showing positive emotions\nwhen you're clearly angry or sad,\nor to ask questions you\nalready know the answers to,\notherwise you may run the risk\nof pushing the people around you away.\nDid you find any of these tips helpful?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share it\nwith those who might benefit from
