    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hello, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to another video.\nHave you ever thought\nthat you've found the one?\nMaybe they've got the brains,\nthe looks, the morals.\nEverything you've desired in a partner.\nAnd you couldn't be more ecstatic.\nThis could be the person of your dreams.\nWell, it's only the first date\nbut still, you wouldn't be happier.\nOnly you sense that there\nmay be something off.\nYou ask yourself, \"Do they\nfeel the same way about me?\"\nWell, sometimes it can\nbe hard to read the signs\nthat someone is simply\nnot that interested.\nSo to help you out,\nPsych2Go presents to you\nnine signs someone is just not into you.\nNumber one, they don't open\nup about themselves at all.\nDo they share their opinions with you?\nWhether it's to talk about their past,\ntheir family or just general\nthings about their life.\nThey're reluctant to open up to you\nmay mean that they're just not into you.\nSerious relationships involve talking\nabout things that matter.\nAlthough you don't need\nto get too personal\non the first or second date,\nif things haven't progressed\nwhen you've been for a while,\nthen they may not be feeling\nthe same way about you\nas you do about them.\nNumber two, they haven't\nmade the move to ask you out.\nSo you're texting this newly\nfound love of your life.\nYou're head over heels for them\nbut they haven't asked you out yet.\nIf you're the only one\nwho's made any attempt\nat meeting together in person,\nwhether that be a romantic evening\nor just to grab a cup of coffee\nand hang out, you might want to reassess\nwhether this person really likes you back.\nAfter all, if they are interested,\nthey'll make an effort\nto ask you out on a date.\nNumber three, you just aren't feeling it.\nOkay, so you think this\nperson is great for you.\nThey have a great personality\nthat matches yours,\nthey're extremely smart,\nyet for some reason,\nyou don't get excited about them at all.\nThe truth is, you can generally figure out\nwhether someone is into you\nby the way they make you feel.\nIf you've been talking to\nthis person for a while\nand you don't feel the\neffort on their end,\nthen there may just not be any chemistry\nbetween the two of you.\nNumber four, they ignore you.\nHave they been ignoring\nyour calls or texts?\nWhat are you doing?\nIf this great person doesn't care enough\nto call you back or respond to your texts,\nthen they clearly don't care enough\nto start a serious relationship with you.\nIn fact, they may be trying to ghost you.\nYou can check out our\nvideo eight signs someone\nis going to ghost you for more insights.\nNumber five, their responses are short.\nAre their responses to\nyour texts extremely brief?\nGenerally, if someone\nisn't interested in you,\nthey won't wanna chat with you for long.\nThink about it.\nIf you don't wanna talk with someone\nbut don't wanna be rude or impolite,\nyou may just give the most\nminimal response required,\nlike a simple K.\nThese short responses may be a sign\nthat they're not that interested.\nNumber six, they don't introduce\nyou to family or friends.\nHave you met any of their\nfriends or family months\ninto the relationship?\nIt may be a sign that they're\nnot that serious about you.\nA study published in\n2014 supports the thought\nthat marshaling for romantic\nrelationships is normal,\nespecially if you can't\nstop thinking about them.\nYou want your closest friends and family\nto root for the one you love\nas much as you root for them.\nSo getting their feedback and security\nis a stepping stone into\nmoving the relationship\ninto a much deeper place.\nNumber seven, they\nbring up their ex often.\nDo they talk about their ex a lot?\nIf they're talking about their\nex more than they're talking\nabout you or themselves,\nthen it's likely that\nthey're not over them.\nWhether it's in a reminiscent way\nor a begrudging way,\nif they're talking about their ex\nand the past memories\nof them all the time,\nthen it might be time for you to realize\nthey're not over them.\nAnd they're probably not\nready to be into you.\nNumber eight, their phone\nis protected at all costs.\nOkay, nobody wants anyone\nsnooping through their phone\nand you shouldn't even feel the need\nto snoop through someone's\nphone if you trust them\nand you feel secure\nwith your relationship.\nBut if they seem overly protective\nabout their phone and especially\nabout who they're texting,\nthen they may be hiding\nsomething from you.\nHowever, it's best to express\nand communicate your concern\nto them instead of confronting head on\nwithout any real evidence.\nAnd number nine, they're not\nready for a relationship,\nand they've told you that.\nOkay, your crush is so prefect\nbut there's just one problem,\nthey've said that they're\nnot ready for a relationship.\nWhoever is, right?\nYou may be thinking that\nthey'll fall for you\nand things will work out\nin time but think again.\nThis person made it clear\nthat they aren't looking\nfor something serious\nand if they had the\nurge to say this to you\nin the beginning,\nthen they really are\njust not that into you.\nDid you relate to any of the\nsigns we mentioned above?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video helpful,\nbe sure to like and share it\nwith
