    "transcript": "Number one, acknowledge\nand accept your emotions.\nIn order to stop feeling\nthis lingering unexplained emptiness,\nyou must acknowledge it and accept it.\nYou may not be able to\ncontrol every situation,\nbut you can control your attitude\nand the way you handle the situation.\nAre you feeling lonely?\nDo you feel disconnected and oddly numb?\nAllow yourself to feel that way if you do,\neven if it's dulled or hard to reach.\nIt's completely okay to take\nthe time you need to deal\nwith heavy emotions.\nMaybe you buried your bad feeling emotions\nor tried to ignore them.\nBut the first step of\nhealing is to sit down\nand process all those feelings.\nWhether they're good or bad,\nall your feelings are valid and important.\nNumber two, let go of the shame and blame.\nIn the process of reflecting\nand trying to better understand\nthis lingering feeling of emptiness,\nyou may feel a sense of shame.\nWhile struggling with feeling empty,\nyou're also likely to feel\na great sense of self-criticism and guilt.\nPsychotherapist and author, Imo Lo,\nstates in her article for\n\"Psychology Today\" that,\n\"It's important to remember\nthat your numbness grew out\nof a place of pain and tenderness,\nand was nothing but a\ndesperate attempt to survive.\nShaming or punishing for\nbecoming numb in the first place\nwill only reinforce the\ndestructive pattern.\"\nAlthough it can be challenging at first,\nyou will need to eliminate any self-blame\nso that you can move forward successfully.\nNumber three, identify the root cause\nof your feelings of emptiness.\nNow that you've acknowledged the emptiness\nthat you've been feeling,\nit's time to get down to the\nroot cause of your feelings.\nWhat exactly is it that's bothering you?\nMaybe you feel fatigued and burnt out\nand are in need of a break?\nMaybe you feel lonely\nbecause you feel isolated\nfrom your friends and family?\nOr perhaps you feel numb\nfrom going through a\nrecent hardship in life.\nWhatever the reason may be for numbness,\nidentifying these feelings,\nand more importantly,\nwhere they're coming from,\nwill help you move forward\nas you understand the true\nsource of your emptiness.\nNumber four, notice and\nappreciate what you have.\nWhen you feel empty,\nnumb, or hopeless inside,\nit can be really easy to\noverlook the positives in life.\nTake a moment to pause, reflect,\nand count your blessings.\nWhat are some things you're grateful for?\nWhat makes you want to\nget out of bed every day?\nWhat's keeping you going\nthrough these tough times?\nMaybe you're thankful for\nhaving a supportive family\nor a roof over your head.\nMaybe you're thankful for your pet\nfor always sticking around,\nor maybe it's the fact that your body\nis keeping you alive and running.\nNo matter how trivial or\ninsignificant it may seem,\ntake note of it, physically\nwrite it down or type it up.\nVisually seeing a list of all\nthe things you're thankful for\ncan really help you gain a\nmore positive perspective\nand strengthen your mind to\nfight this dreadful feeling.\nNumber five, create and\nfollow a healthy routine.\nRefocusing yourself can\nmake a great difference\nin allowing you to give\nyourself the opportunity\nto get back on the right track.\nCreate a realistic balanced routine\nthat can be achievable on a daily basis.\nA few important factors you\nshould include in this routine\nshould be some sort of physical\nactivity, plenty of rest,\nample hydration, and a nutritious diet.\nAnd don't forget to make\ntime for some fun too.\nYou can organize this with\nthe help of a planner,\na to-do list, or even\nreminders on your phone.\nThe little things can add\nup to make a big difference\nand being able to check off\neverything you've accomplished\nover the course of the\nday can really give you\na sense of achievement.\nNumber six, practice mindfulness.\nTo be mindful, pay close attention\nand make a careful\nobservation of your thoughts.\nThe Seleni Institute highlights\nhow mindfulness is exceptionally\nbeneficial, stating that,\n\"Mindfulness calls us to\nnotice when our thoughts\nhave drifted to the past or\nwandered into the future,\nand when we're regretting,\nfantasizing, or worrying,\nrather than engaging with\nwhat's right in front of us.\"\nMindfulness can allow you\nto obtain better clarity,\ncomfort, and tranquility in your thinking.\nLearning, practicing, and\nimplementing the concept\nof mindfulness in your day-to-day life\nwill truly be an extraordinary superpower\nthat can help you ride the\nunpredictable waves of life.\nNumber seven, try to learn something new.\nDepersonalization, along with multiple\nother mental health issues gets worse\nwhen the brain is being\nunder-stimulated and inactive.\nVarious neurological studies have shown\nthat learning new skills\ncan significantly improve\nyour brain's competence and proficiency.\nIt can allow you to revitalize your mind\nwhile giving you the opportunity\nto find a productive way\nto channel your built-up energy.\nYou could try learning a new language,\nplaying an instrument,\ncooking up delicious meals\nwith new recipes, taking\nup yoga, hand-lettering,\nor pretty much any other\nproductive activity.\nThe sky's the limit.\nGive yourself a chance to\nbreak out of your shell.\nAnd number eight, reach\nout for external help.\nWhen self-help isn't quite\nworking out the way you'd hoped,\nit's always great to reach out\nto someone to aid you\nthrough your recovery.\nInternal battles sometimes\nneed some external help,\nand that's perfectly okay.\nReach out to a trusted family member,\nfriend, or a mental health professional.\nHaving someone to talk to can\nreally help get perspective\nfor your problems.\nIt can be challenging to\nopen up to someone else\nwhile you're feeling so emotionally numb,\nbut making meaningful connections\nand asking for help can\ngive you a strong foundation\nfor a true inner transformation.\nLastly, here's a friendly reminder\nthat your journey to self-healing\nand revitalization will\nnot happen overnight.\nPersistence and continuity\nis the key to recovery.\nRemember that every well-intentioned step\nthat you take to get yourself\nout of this emptiness\nis a step in the right direction.\nIt could take multiple trials\nto find out what works for you,\nbut the effort will always be worth it.\nAt the end of the day,\nit's all about progress, not perfection.\nPlease like and share this\nvideo if it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else
