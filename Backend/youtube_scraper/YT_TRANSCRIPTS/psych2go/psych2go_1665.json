    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Hey you Psych2Goers,\nwelcome back to another video.\nBefore we start, we would\nlike to thank you all\nfor the support that you've given us.\nPsych2Go's mission is to make\npsychology and mental health\nmore accessible to everyone,\nand you help us do that, so thank you.\nNow let's begin.\nDo your friends call\nyou a hopeless romantic?\nDo you see things through\nrose tinted glasses?\nBeing described as a hopeless romantic\nmeans that you view the world\nin a more idealistic\nand fairytale-like way\ncompared to those who are\nmore logical and realistic.\nYou tend to have your head in the clouds,\nbelieving that love will always\nfind its way into your life,\neven if love has brought\nyou all sorts of trouble.\nWhether it's through failed\nrelationships or bad breakups,\nyou still believe that you'll\nfind the right person for you\nin the end.\nHere are 10 signs that you\nare a hopeless romantic.\nNumber one.\nIt doesn't matter how\nmany failed relationships\nare behind you,\nyou still believe in the right one.\nDo you always hold faith\nthat your next relationship\nwill be better than the last?\nSometimes people can feel hopeless\nafter a failed relationship.\nThey may even give up on trying\nto find the right partner\nafter some time,\nbut not you.\nAs a hopeless romantic,\neven if you recognize a bad relationship\nyou still refuse to give up\nand hope that the right person\nwill present themselves to\nyou when the time is right.\nNumber two.\nWhen your significant other isn't around\nyou adjust your pillows\njust to pretend you're\nlying on their shoulder\nto be able to fall asleep.\nHave you ever felt like\nyour bed is a lot emptier\nwithout your partner around?\nThe feeling of skin to skin contact\ncan feel like the most\nnatural thing in the world\nwhere you feel safe, warm, and secure.\nIf you are able to still feel their love\nand connection to you even when\nthey may not be next to you,\nthen that's a sign that you\nare a hopeless romantic.\nNumber three.\nYou're always excited for Valentine's Day.\nAre you a fan of Valentine's Day?\nDo you get incredibly\nexcited about the festivities\nand the romantic atmosphere\nthis day brings about?\nAfter all it's the one day of the year\nwhere people like to publicly profess\ntheir feelings and love for each other.\nEven if you're single\nyou're still able to\nappreciate and get excited\nfor the romance and love in the air.\nNumber four.\nYou love everything about life\neven the difficult times.\nHave others told you\nthat you have a childlike\nenthusiasm for life?\nUnlike the pessimist of the world,\nyou see the beauty in\neverything around you.\nEven when life gets tough\nand you're going through a difficult time\nyou still try to look at\nthe brighter side of things\nand believe that it's never\nas bleak as it may seem.\nNumber five.\nYou've dreamed about\ngoing on romantic dates\naround the world.\nHave you always dreamt about\ntraveling to Paris or Venice\nfor a romantic date?\nPerhaps you've fantasized\nabout going to some of the most beautiful\nand romantic places in the world\nwith someone you truly care about,\njust so you can have that\nromantic experience with them.\nAs a hopeless romantic,\nyou want to take pictures\neat and drink some of the best food,\nvisit the beautiful landmarks\nand make the best memories\nwith your partner.\nNumber six.\nYou celebrate the small\nthings in a relationship.\nWhether it's enjoying a cup\nof tea with a loved one,\nor getting them their favorite snack,\nyou take time time to\ncelebrate and show your love\nto those you care about.\nYou don't shy away from paying attention\nto what's important,\nand you aren't embarrassed\nby sharing special moments,\nthoughts, and feelings\nwith them however small.\nNumber seven.\nYou may have high standards\nwhich may be unrealistic.\nDo you ever daydream\nabout what your future\npartner might look like?\nOne of the drawbacks of\nbeing a hopeless romantic\nis that you have almost\nimpossibly high standards\nfor the people you want to love.\nIt's possible that by daydreaming\nabout the person you want to be with,\nit creates a person that\ndoesn't exist in reality.\nYou may end up pushing away people\nwho could make you really happy\nbecause they don't fit that\nimage you have in your head.\nNumber eight.\nEverything makes you\ncry, even YouTube videos.\nDo you cry really easily?\nShowing emotions is not a\nweakness but a strength.\nWhether it's a cute animal video\nor a short animated clip\nthat you're watching,\nyou can't help but tear up\nat the sight before you.\nThis may be because compared to others,\nhopeless romantics are\ngenerally more comfortable\nat expressing their emotions.\nNumber nine.\nYou love a good chick\nflick or a love ballad.\nAre you a fan of romance?\nWell, of course you are.\nAnd as a hopeless romantic,\nsometimes all you need is to curl up\nand watch a cheesy\nromantic comedy or a drama.\nYou tend to feel things quite intensely.\nAnd so these romantic films\ncan trigger and stir up\nthe overwhelming emotions inside of you.\nAnd number 10.\nImperfections are perfect to you.\nEverybody has imperfections\nor self-esteem issues\nfrom time to time,\nbut hopeless romantics don't\ncare about any of that.\nYou don't see imperfections in others.\nInstead you see past the surface\nand love them for who they are\nsince you're able to\nappreciate and find the beauty\nin the things they may\nnot like about themselves,\nyou end up making them feel\nmore comfortable and loved.\nSo are you a hopeless romantic?\nHow many signs did you relate to?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you found this video
