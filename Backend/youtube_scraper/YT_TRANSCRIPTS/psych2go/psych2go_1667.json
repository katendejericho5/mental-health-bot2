    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psyche2Goers.\nWe hope you're doing well, and\nfinding time for self-care.\nNow let's begin.\nDo you go through life and\nfeel a lingering sadness\nthat never seems to improve?\nYou're not alone.\nDepression is a complicated condition,\nand effects you in different\nways than you may think.\nSo with that said,\nhere are six signs that you\nare subconsciously depressed.\nPlease note, the information in this video\nis not intended nor\nimplied to be a substitute\nfor professional medical\nadvice, diagnosis, or treatment.\nAll content contained in this video\nis for general information purposes only,\nand does not replace a\nconsultation with your own doctor\nor mental health professional.\nLet's begin.\nNumber one, you always feel tired.\nWhen you wake up,\nare you finding yourself feeling drained?\nDoes this feeling seem to last,\nno matter how much sleep you get?\nDepression comes with a\nnumber of physical effects\nthat are often passed\noff as something else.\nConstant exhaustion is a\ncommon physical side effect.\nEven if you sleep a good\nnumber of hours each night,\nyou can never seem to catch enough rest.\nThis makes it hard to\nfunction during the day.\nNumber two, you're easily\nirritated and angered.\nDoes it seem like everyone\ngets on your nerves?\nEven if these people are well-meaning,\nyou can't help but wish they'd go away.\nIt's not uncommon for depressed people\nto foster negative thoughts and feelings\nabout the people around them.\nWhile we all have those days\nwhere we prefer to keep away from others,\nif you're noticing that\nyou're pushing people away\nmore than normal, or if a friend\nis withdrawing from others,\nit can be a sign of something more.\nNumber three, you have a\nhard time with emotions.\nHow do you feel right now?\nAre you able to describe which\nemotions you're experiencing?\nDo you often have periods\nof time where you can't?\nPsychiatrist Peter Sifneos\ncoined the term alexithymia\nas being unable to describe how you feel.\nFor example, while you may\nnotice that your heart is racing,\na normal person would be able to tell\nif they're excited or nervous easily.\nOn the other hand, a\nperson with alexithymia,\nwouldn't be able to distinguish\nif it was fear or excitement causing it.\nNot knowing your emotions\nmakes it extremely difficult\nto know where to begin in tackling them.\nNumber four, you don't\neat, or you eat too much.\nHave you developed\ndifferent eating habits?\nDo you find yourself forgetting to eat,\nor are you unable to stop eating?\nYou may develop chaotic eating habits\nas a way to cope with how you're feeling.\nOvereating may be your\nonly source of pleasure,\ncausing you to lose sight\nof your physical health.\nOn the other hand, you\nmay lose interest in food,\nand end up missing meals.\nDifferent stressors in your life\ncan throw off your sense of balance,\nwhich can also affect your eating habits.\nNumber five, others don't think\nyou look like a depressed person.\nHas anyone ever told you that\nyou don't seem depressed?\nYou or they may be accustomed\nto the media's portrayal\nof what a depressed person looks like?\nSomeone who never leaves their\nroom, doesn't dress well,\nand always has a miserable look.\nWhile those are clear\nsigns of the condition,\ndepression doesn't always appear that way.\nAccording to Psychotherapist Jodi Aman,\ndepression affects all personalities,\nand can look very different\nfrom person to person.\nPeople with depression\ncan suffer in silence too.\nThese are people that can perform\ntasks towards their goals,\nand do their day to day tasks,\nbut still have lost their spark.\nThen number six, you find it hard\nto put a smile on your\nface, but you still do.\nDo you try to mask\nyourself as a happy person,\neven if you don't feel\nthat way deep inside?\nMany people who experience depression\nconceal it behind a smile.\nDepression can be quiet on the outside,\nbut extremely painful inside for some,\nwhile others display their\nsymptoms more outwardly.\nHaving an honest conversation\nwith a mental health\nprofessional or someone you trust\nshould be a top priority.\nEven if you worry about burdening others,\nappearing weak, or feeling vulnerable,\nconfronting and processing\nyour emotions with others\nis a great first step to recovery.\nIt's difficult to deal\nwith depression alone.\nYou may be struggling now,\nbut there's a world out there\nof people cheering you on.\nConfide with someone you trust,\nand talk to a trusted professional\nto get the help you need.\nBe sure to like this video,\nand share it with anyone\nyou feel will benefit from it.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go,\nand turn notifications on\nto keep up with our uploads.\nThank you so much for watching,\nand stay tuned for the\nnext video, take care."
