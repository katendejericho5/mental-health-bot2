Myers-Briggs\npersonality type indicator,\nyou can gain a better understanding\nof not only who you are\nbut also, about how other\npeople perceive you.\nBased on the theory of\npersonality proposed\nby Carl Gustav Jung,\nthe MBTI is a famous\npsychological test developed\nby the mother-daughter pair,\nKatharine Cook Briggs and Isabel Myers.\nThe personality test assesses\nyour individual personality\nbased on four dimensions:\nintroversion versus extroversion,\nintuition versus sensing,\nfeeling versus thinking\nand judging versus\nperceiving or prospecting.\nBut of course, a quick disclaimer.\nSince this list is based on the MBTI,\nwhich in turn, based on a theory,\nit's not meant to be taken too seriously.\nIt's just for fun.\nWith that said, here are\nthe most
