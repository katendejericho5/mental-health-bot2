    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey Psych2goers,\nwelcome back to our channel.\nThank you all so much for the\nlove that you've given us,\nyour ongoing support has\nhelped us make psychology\nand mental health more\naccessible to everyone.\nSo thank you.\nNow, let's continue.\nHave you ever wondered\nwhether you're truly happy?\nWhen your days are filled with obligations\nand responsibilities and rushed weekends,\nit can be hard to tell\nif it's all making you\nas happy as you can be.\nWhile happiness is determined\nby multiple factors,\nthere are some common signs\nthat you may be unhappy\nwithout even knowing it.\nSo with that said,\nhere are six signs you may\nbe unhappy with your life.\nNumber one, you spend a lot\nof time on social media.\nWho doesn't love scrolling\nthrough Instagram or\nTwitter from time-to-time?\nIt's interesting and fun\nto catch up on the news\nand see what other people are up to.\nBut we should be aware that social media\nis a catalyst for unhealthy comparisons.\nYou may find yourself extremely invested\nin the snapshots of your friends\nas a way to fill a void in your own life.\nOr if you find yourself\nposting several times a day,\nyou may be seeking validation\nfrom those around you.\nUnplugging for a bit and taking\ntime away from your phone\nwill help to clear your head.\nNumber two, you wake up\nwith a dreadful feeling.\nWhen you roll out of bed in the morning,\nare you looking forward to the day ahead\nor does the morning sun\nmake you wanna crawl\nright back up under the covers?\nIf thinking about your day\ncauses a pit to form in your stomach\nor intense feelings of stress,\nyou might wanna ask yourself why.\nYou could just be a night owl\nand can't get yourself up\nunless the coffee's ready first\nbut beyond being tired,\nif you're dreading the day ahead of you\nthis is a subtle sign that\nyou're unhappy with your life.\nNumber three, you cling\nto a far-away light.\nDo you fantasize about\nthe future all the time?\nDo you get lost in your imaginations\nabout what you want for your future self?\nAccording to Austin Considine from VICE,\nthinking too much about your future\nmight be fostering\nunhappiness in your life.\nStudies show that being\ngrounded in the present\nand living in the moment\ncauses higher levels\nof personal happiness.\nYou might be spending\na lot of time thinking\nabout what you want your life to look like\ninstead of appreciating what\nit looks like right now.\nYou have the opportunity\nfor personal growth\neach and every day.\nBeing present is difficult,\nespecially when our lives\nseem to be so future-focused\nbut taking at least a few minutes each day\nto bask in the now will make you happier\nin the long-run.\nNumber four, busy days\naren't satisfying to you.\nDo you feel satisfied with your work\nwhen you're being productive\nor do you wind up feeling\nirritated instead?\nAccording to Carolyn Steber from Bustle,\nmisguided irritation is a common sign\nthat you're unhappy with your life.\nWhy do you think you're\ngetting so irritated\nin the first place?\nWhen you're unexpectedly busy,\nthis can cause you to\nfeel rundown and exhausted\nmore quickly than if\nyou were participating\nin activities that you enjoyed.\nOf course, it's normal to be tired\nafter any kind of busy day,\nbut if you feel constantly\nirritated or dissatisfied,\nyou might not be spending\ntime on the things\nthat matter most to you.\nNumber five, you ruminate\nover your purpose.\nDo you often find yourself wondering,\nwhy am I even doing this?\nTo a certain degree\nreflection and introspection\nare good practices to maintain\nas they help to ensure\nthat you're on the right track.\nHowever, according to\nphysician Dr. Lissa Rankin,\nconstantly questioning yourself\non whether or not you're\nfulfilling your life's purpose\nis a good indication\nthat you might be unhappy\nwith your life.\nAccording to Rankin, you may\nfeel like your daily life\nis meaningless or task-driven.\nThis means that you feel caught\nin between needing to\ncheck off your to-do lists\nand chasing your dreams and passions.\nIf you feel this way, you're not alone.\nWhen life gets busy,\nit's easy to lose sight\nof the bigger picture,\nwhen your daily tasks start to take up\nmore and more of your time.\nAnd number six, you no longer\ncare about your wellbeing.\nHave you given up on\nprioritizing your wellbeing\nand your social life.\nIf you're feeling\ndespondent about your life,\nyou might be struggling to find happiness.\nDisinterest in your own\nwellbeing, social life,\nand regular hobbies can\nbe a strong indication\nthat you're letting your\nhappiness go to the wayside\nin favor of work and other tasks.\nThis can also apply to other\naspects of your wellbeing,\nsuch as your physical\nand emotional health,\nwhich contribute to your happiness.\nTaking care of your mind\nand protecting your peace is so important,\nso try not to let go of the\nthings that make you smile.\nDid you relate to any of\nthese signs of an happiness?\nIf you feel like you're struggling,\nknow that the power to\nchange and grow is within you\nand it's just waiting to be tapped into.\nOr do you possibly have any tips\nto share about fostering happiness?\nTell us about your experiences\nin the comments below.\nPlease
