    "transcript": "the psychology of Love is one of the\nmost interesting topics and one we're\nall curious about wouldn't you agree and\nthough it can mean something different\nfor everyone that doesn't stop us from\ntrying to better understand it and\nseeking to learn how to nurture it and\nthose psychologists have put forth\nplenty of ideas and theories about love\nwhat it is the many faces of it how and\nwhy it happens something that maybe we\ndon't explore enough is how love\ndevelops over time with that said stick\naround to learn more about the five\nstages of love and why most people stop\nat three stage one infactuation and\nearly attachment according to clinical\npsychologist Dr Debra kusaba the\nearliest stage of falling in love has a\nlot to do with attraction infactuation\nand early attachment often people will\nexperience a strong sense of euphoria\nbeing around the object of their\naffection and when their feelings are\nreciprocated life will seem all the\nsweet for it they'll get butterflies\nlaugh more flirt often and feel little\nelse but passion and playfulness this is\nusually everyone's favorite stage of\nlove because it's all about fun and\nromance stage two getting serious enter\nstage two once the initial glow of first\nfalling in love wears off couples will\noften start to get serious about their\nrelationship this phase is usually when\na lot of big commitments are made like\nsaying I love you for the first time or\nlearning to compromise with your partner\ncouples who don't put in the work says\npsychotherapist and clinical social\nworker Allison Abrams will likely drift\napart once their attraction wears off\nand may even find themselves getting\ninfatuated with other people stage three\nthe crisis stage in a decades long\nclinical study on how the brain reacts\nto love conducted by neuroscientist Dr\nHelen Fischer and clinical psychologist\nDr Lucy Brown the more evolved part of\nthe brain will thought to take over\nafter couples have been together for a\nwhile participants describe their love\nas richer deeper and more rooted in\nknowing the other person better Dr Brown\nexplains that this stronger bond is a\nresult of facing a significant crisis\ntogether which helped both parties see\nhow much they've grown changed and\nwhether or not they can continue to grow\ntogether that's why this is often\nreferred to as the make or break point\nof relationships and why most people\nstop at this stage of love\nstage four climbing down from the\npedestal not all couples come out of the\ncrisis stage and those that do don't\nalways emerge unscathed it's at this\nstage that the couple sees each other's\nflaws and weaknesses most clearly but\nlearns to forgive and accept one another\nin spite of them according to an article\npublished by bit help this stage is\nmarked by a deeper commitment and strong\nfeelings of contentment because it is no\nlonger a love held up by ideals of Ro\nromance or passion but rather by a\nstrong Foundation of friendship trust\nand mutual respect often couples at this\nstage are married have children or live\ntogether stage five deep attachment and\nstability not long after the fourth\ncomes the fifth and final stage of Love\ndeep attachment and stability according\nto better help reaching this stage is\nquite a rare achievement as it means\nthat a strong and Lasting bond has been\nmade the relationship ship has already\nreached a place of balance stability and\ncontinued emotional fulfillment the only\nthing left to do is to keep it that way\nby remaining communicative honest and\nloving towards one another they say\nnothing worth having comes easy well\nthat's certainly true when it comes to\nlove it can be beautiful and ining yes\nbut far from the perfect fairy tale most\nof us may want to believe but having a\ngood understanding of the different\nstages the relationship goes through can\nhelp you navigate your way towards a\nmore enduring and loving\npartnership so what are your general\nthoughts on this video or about love in\ngeneral let us know in the comments down\nbelow if you enjoyed this video go ahead\nand share it with others until next time\nthanks for watching and take\ncare"
