    "transcript": "not all types of manipulation are the\nsame because not everyone operates the\nsame way manipulation can range from\nbeing subtle to being aggressive and\nphysical there are many reasons why\npeople try to manipulate others whether\nthat is from jealousy fear or poor\ncommunication skills among others there\nare also many ways that people can\nmanipulate others we'll be discussing 10\nof the most common ways in this video\nand now let's see 10 ways people\nmanipulate to get what they want number\none passive aggressiveness passive\naggressiveness is a way for people to\nexpress anger without being violent but\nit can also work as a way to manipulate\nin many cases it is used to give\nbackhanded comments make people feel\nguilty or feel as if the abuser could\nexplode at any moment and confuse the\nvictim a type of passive aggressive\nmanipulation is threatening to hurt\nthemselves much like the example above\nthey might threaten to hurt or kill\nthemselves or someone else in order to\nget a certain reaction from you the\ntactic is to teach you a lesson saying\nI'll hurt myself to hurt you says an\narticle on the Goodman project it's\nappealing for your sympathy aimed at\nmaking you feel guilty it's attention\nseeking drama aimed at you and gaining\ncontrol again along with threatening\npassive aggressiveness can also come\nwith psychological manipulation\nstonewalling and sarcasm among others\naccording to the Goodman project number\ntwo moving\ngoalposts moving goalposts is when one\nperson puts up a goal I.E we will do\nthis when and then ends up changing\ntheir mind which culminates in adding\nmore or different requirements to reach\na certain goal these requirements\nusually satisfy the abuser and have no\nbenefit to the victim by moving the\ngoals the manipulator keeps the victim\nhanging by a thread as well as under\ncontrol good therapy offers an example\nfor example a bully may use their\ncoworker's clothes as an excuse to\nharass them if the individual changes\noutfits the bully may claim the person\nwon't deserve professional respect until\nthey change their hairstyle their accent\nor another miscellaneous trait number\nthree manipulation of facts when an\nabuser tries manipulating facts they\nwill change or look for the statistics\nthat benefit them a manipulator will\nactively lad you make excuses blame you\nor strategically share facts about them\nand withhold other truths States WebMD\nin doing this they feel they are gaining\npower over you and gaining intellectual\nsuperiority the more believable it is\nthe less likely the other person will go\nto verify that information this makes\nthe manipulator feel as if they have\nsome type of psychological and mental\nadvantage over the victim number four\ncruel humor using cruel humor such as\njokes to insult or demean someone with\nthe excuse that it's just a joke is a\nway to break down the victim emotionally\nand mentally but it also works to make\nothers see the victim In a Different\nLight if cruel humor is used often in\nfront of the same people this tactic\nused by manipulators is meant to poke at\nyour weaknesses and make you feel\ninsecure States WebMD on their side by\nmaking you look bad they have a sense of\npsychological\nsuperiority number five exaggeration and\ngeneralization vagueness is often hard\nto confront or dispute which is why\nmanipulators like to generalize things\nso much according to Ross e Collins\ngeneralization and exaggeration enhance\nthe glittering effect the glittering\neffect is a situation that serves in\npainting what is said in a good light\ninstead of a negative one by how the\nperson says things it also makes it\nharder to see holes in their arguments\nthere's really nothing specific or out\nfront that the victim can grab on and\nthrow back at the abuser although they\nmight feel that something is wrong this\nwill leave them confused and trying to\nanalyze what is happening number six\nlying if they don't use exaggeration or\ngeneralization an abuser will use Li to\ntry to get you to believe in whatever\nthey say when they are caught they will\nlie on top of the lie to keep the\nillusion going as much as possible\nlying is the primary tool manipulative\npeople use to continue living a hidden\nlife the manifestation can be as simple\nas I was late to work because I\noverslept or as complex as I got fired\nbecause my boss felt threatened by my\nSuperior knowledge says Red Mountain\nSedona a clinic for helping young people\novercome difficulties and thve when\nlying is used as a primary tool it\nbecomes a cycle of Deceit that not only\ntraps the liar but also the people\nsurrounding the liar a person who has\nfallen prey to such Behavior becomes an\nexpert at lying and deceiving in an\neffort to pursue a destructive lifestyle\na Red Mountain continues the poor\ndecisions and choices move into the\ndriver's seat and the person begins to\nfeel like a passenger who has little or\nno control over the journey in order to\nbreak out of the cycle of Deceit it's\nimportant to become aware of it first\nand then get help number seven\ninsecurities playing on someone else's\ninsecurities is a sure way to bring them\ndown while at the same time making them\nthink things that aren't true\nmanipulators exploit these insecurities\nor weaknesses for their pleasure or\ntheir need to feel in control or above\nyou they may make fun of you make you\nfeel small and insignificant or be\npassive aggressive among other things\nall until you break down and believe\nthat you truly are\nworthless number eight fear in General\nwhen someone is confronted by a fear\nthey may run hide or freeze similar to\nhow someone reacts to a dangerous\nsituation but abusers only look for one\nthing when they're using your fear\nagainst you they are looking to keep you\nexactly where you are frozen and under\ntheir control to create this fear they\nmay use psychological and emotional\ntactics as well as physical intimidation\neven threats to your loved ones or\nthreats relating to to exposing some\ninformation you don't want out there\nremember our story about your\nsignificant other threatening to kill\nthemselves or someone else if you leave\nthem as you can see threats can also\ninclude strangers as this type of tactic\nis used to reach your empathy and\nrespect towards people you don't know\nnumber nine silent treatment the silent\ntreatment is another manipulation tactic\nwhere the abuser tries to make you\nsubmit to their demands by withholding\naffection time together and\ncommunication and making you feel guilt\nand shame for something they say you did\nwrong which most likely turns out to be\nsomething that you actually did right\nbut that threatens the abuser's sense of\ncontrol according to good therapy it is\nalso used to punish or make the victim\nfearful as silent treatment can also\nbecome psychological manipulation number\n10 recruiting others to help good\ntherapy gives this example of an abusive\nparents asking family members to remind\na child how much the parent has\nsacrificed for the child of course this\ndoesn't only happen in parent child\nrelationships it can also happen between\nromantic Partners where one partner goes\nto their mutual friends or even family\nto get support and something they said\nthat they know will bring you down it\ncan happen between so-called friends or\nwork colleagues as well it is good to\nnote that the other people being\nrecruited don't always know what's going\non and they might just agree based on\nthe perceptions they have not\nnecessarily the the abuse that's going\non between the abuser and the victim\nsince it's possible that the recruited\npeople aren't even aware of it the\nsocial pressure May convince the child\nor person to stop complaining about\nabusive Behavior finishes good therapy\nremember that a manipulator such as an\nabuser can combine these and other\ntactics not mentioned here in order to\nget what they want it also depends on\nthe situation that is being lived at the\nmoment if you think you're being\nmanipulated we suggest going to a\nprofessional or a trusted third party we\nhope that this has helped you in dipping\nyour toe in and starting to
