    "transcript": "every little thing can feel like a\nsudden reminder you could be having a\nnormal day and Echoes from the past hit\nyou like a ton of bricks you may freeze\nup you may feel rage or you might even\ntry to avoid these feelings altogether\nbut the pain of childhood trauma remains\nand can manifest into your psyche in\nvarious ways there is no one size fits\nall when it comes to trauma responses\nand triggers since trauma itself is\ncomplex and can come in many different\nforms but in this video we're going to\nlearn about oddly specific childhood\ntraumas with the help of licensed social\nworker Patrick tan let's begin emotional\ndelay emotional delay is when an emotion\nabout something can take several hours\nto catch up with you for example let's\nsay your boss or partner asks something\nof you and at the moment you say yes\nlater in the day you start to get upset\nabout feeling taken advantage of or not\nfeeling seen it may feel like an\nescalation of emotion that you weren't\nin touch with at the time of the event\nearlier in the day or yesterday how does\nthis stem from trauma well it is due to\ndisassociation and hypervigilance which\nrefers to a state of heightened\nawareness and having your guard up\nchildhood trauma survivors struggle with\nnot being fully in their bodies and\nbeing present in their emotions in real\ntime the hypervigilance in survivors of\nchildhood trauma occurs when our inner\nchild kind of goes wait a minute was I\njust taken advantage of or let down\nagain this emotional delay can cause you\nto lash out later on which can leave\nthose around you feeling confused but\nreally it's a trauma\nresponse refrigerator Buzz depression\nimagine having a refrigerator that\nconstantly buzzes loudly for years and\nyou never notice it this sound is just\nbuzzing in the background until one day\nit hits you what's that buzzing noise\nthis is the exact same thing that\nhappens with refrigerator Buzz\ndepression this trauma stems from not\nrealizing that you've been depressed\nbecause you've just been that way your\nentire life until one day the pain and\ngrief finally hits you where does this\ncome from it comes from not getting help\ngrowing up as well as several different\nchildhood situations and dynamics that\ncaused you to shut down emotionally and\nthat haven't been fully resolved some\nexamples would be witnessing a parent\nstruggle with alcoholism death medical\ntrauma having oppressive parents Etc\nthis creates a false belief in victims\nof childhood trauma that nothing will\never change for the better being\ndepressed becomes a natural defense\nmechanism and over time you become numb\nto difficult\nsituations being tired is a trigger this\nsimply means we confuse our body just\nnaturally being tired with depression or\nfailing such such as not being good\nenough trauma survivors can be addicted\nto productivity or being on a mission an\nexample is punishing oneself for\nsleeping too much or even trying to\nrelax which can happen subconsciously\nthis behavior is highly damaging to\none's self-esteem because you're\nlabeling yourself a failure or loser for\nsleeping or taking a break which is\nsomething you deserve and you shouldn't\nfeel guilty for doing so where does this\ncome from emotional neglect as a child\nfrom your parents not being present or\nfulfilling your emotional needs being\ntired can be a trigger to sad feelings\nso we try to keep the party going to\nnumb the pain you should never feel\nashamed about feeling tired or\nemotionally exhausted it's completely\nnormal but your trauma brain May trigger\nyou to feel guilt for doing\nso on the spot\ndisassociation this isn't simply\ndisassociating or checking out it's a\nfeeling of literally leaving your body\nor freezing when you feel that you're\nbeing put on the spot some examples of\non the spot disassociation include\nhaving to do a presentation in front of\npeople at school or work and having an\nanxiety attack or even being nervous and\nfidgety on a first date when being asked\nintimate questions where does this come\nfrom psychiatrist Vin yalom talks about\nhow we usually only put a child on the\nspot abusively and an example is how a\nparent may put their finger on their\nchild's face and speak to them\naggressively in an attempt to instill\nfear and intimidation this type of\ntrauma response also stems from parents\nwho are hypercritical and overbearing\nsuch as not giving a child enough space\nand not allowing their thoughts and\nopinions to be heard laughing through\nthe pain this trauma response comes up\nwhen someone is expressing or discussing\ntheir childhood story and what they\nendured specifically this looks like\nlike jokingly talking about abusive or\nhorrific childhood trauma experiences in\nan overly casual or funny way you'll see\nthis come up when others are shocked or\nin disbelief about a person's stories of\ntrauma but the Survivor isn't fully\nconnected to the severity of what they\nare talking about and what happened to\nthem our inner child pops up in these\nsituations and tells the truth but\ndoesn't know how to take the truth of\nour abuse seriously since no one else\ndid where does this come from this\nresponse comes from dealing with a\nhighly toxic family with extreme neglect\nand having no one to stand up for you it\nalso comes from a highly costic and\nsarcastic family that withholds love and\naffection\nintentionally can you relate to any of\nthese specific trauma responses let us\nknow in the comments be sure to check\nout Patrick Tan's YouTube channel for\ninteresting insights on trauma and\nfamily systems which is linked in the\ndescription as always stay kind and have\na beautiful day
