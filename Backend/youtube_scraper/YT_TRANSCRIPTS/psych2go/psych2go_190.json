    "transcript": "have you ever experienced trauma whether\nit was a onetime event or a long-term\nsituation trauma leaves a lasting impact\non your well-being even when the\ntraumatic event ends its effects can\nstill linger in the form of triggers\ntriggers can be anything from a sound a\nsmell or even a person who reminds you\nof the trauma and causes you to relive\nit but sometimes these triggers go\nunnoticed making you wonder why do I\nfeel like this in this video we will\nexplain why triggers happen some signs\nyou've been triggered and most\nimportantly how to heal the bottom up\nprocess have you ever wondered how your\nbrain developed if you have it's time\nyou found out because it's one of the\nmany different ways we're trying to\nunderstand triggers and Trauma in her\npost for psychology today clinical\npsychologist Dr Monica Johnson described\nsomething called the Trine brain model\nfar in the past when we were still in\nFlintstone times and humans were cavemen\nwe only needed basic responses to\nsurvive that's when we relied on our\nreptilian most primitive part of the\nbrain this part is responsible for the\nautomatic quick responses that help us\nSurvive by promptly responding to Danger\nas we developed and started Living in\ngroups emotions became as important as\nsurvival that's when the mamalian brain\ndeveloped to understand and respond to\nthe emotions of others and as societies\nbecame more complex the neocortex\nemerged to help with logical thinking\nand decision-making these three parts of\nthe brain reptilian mamalian and\nneocortex work together in the bottomup\ntrauma process to help us process\ntraumatic events the hijacked brain\naccording to Dr Johnson triggers happen\nbecause your brain becomes hyp sensitive\nto stimuli when a traumatic event occurs\nthe stimulus travels through these three\nparts of the brain for example if you\nwere verbally abused by someone your\nReptilian Brain was the first to respond\nyour heart racing breath quickened and\nyou were on high alert next your Maman\nbrain kicked in and you started to feel\nemotions such as fear anger and sadness\nfinally the neocortex attempted to make\nsense of what just happened trying to\nunderstand why this event occurred\ntriggers like loud sounds can cause you\nto relive the traumatic event and feel\nlike you're going through the process\nagain even if these sounds are different\nfrom someone yelling at you your brain\nmakes you still feel unsafe but many\ntimes those triggers go unnoticed a 2013\nstudy published in the Journal of\nabnormal psychology showed that people\nmay often be totally unaware of their\ntriggers you may feel that something's\nnot right but you can't figure out what\nit is luckily psychologists have\nidentified some signs that can help you\nrecognize you're being triggered signs\nyou've been triggered in her article for\nthe Catalyst Center licensed clinical\npsychologist Dr Carmen Thulin explains\nthat there are a few domains that we\nfrequently see in trauma triggers let's\nexplore how you can recognize the\ntriggers in each of these areas\nanger irritability one of the signs that\nyour trauma is triggered is anger or\nirritability Dr Thulin says that the key\nway to identify this is through an\noverreaction to certain situations you\nmay get irrationally angry over small\nseemingly insignificant things and\nwonder why you're so angry you may also\nexperience sensory sensitivity where\nyou're easily over stimulated by noises\nor Body Sensations that do not normally\nbother you this can include things such\nas touch from other\nor tags on clothing the anger may feel\nsudden and uncontrollable which is a\nsign that your trauma has been triggered\nmood trauma can leave a lasting impact\non our emotional well-being Dr Thulin\nsuggests that unexplained changes in\nmood can be a sign that something is off\nmaybe you're feeling more down than\nusual or struggling to shake off\nfeelings of worthlessness or perhaps\nyou're feeling a mix of intense sadness\nand hypomania where you're driven to\nseek out novelty or change and an effort\nto avoid avoid dealing with difficult\nemotions feelings of hopelessness or the\nbelief that the future is doomed in some\nway can also be signs that your trauma\nhas been triggered\ndissociation another common response to\ntrauma is dissociation a way for the\nmind to distance itself from the body in\nthe present moment Dr thulan says this\nfeels like you're disconnected from time\nand space and the world around you is\nfoggy or blurry as if you're not fully\npresent you may also experience dealing\niation where the world seems fake like\nyou're watching a movie or playing a\nvideo game dissociation can also take\nthe form of reexperiencing your trauma\nthrough flashbacks nightmares intrusive\nthoughts or daydreaming anxiety the last\nsign of a triggered trauma that Dr\nthulan mentions is anxiety if you're\ntriggered you may get stuck in a cycle\nof worrying and ruminating over past\nexperiences or future fears these\nthoughts can be accompanied by a general\nsense of unease or that something\nsomething is wrong and can often be\naccompanied by physical symptoms such as\nfeeling jumpy erasing heart or shortness\nof breath some people may also find\nthemselves researching their trauma but\navoid taking action or allowing\nthemselves to feel it additionally it's\ncommon to minimize the trauma and say\nthings like it wasn't that bad others\nhave it worse or even it's not really\ntrauma even though your trauma is valid\nthese triggers can be challenging to\nmanage it may feel overwhelming\nand defeating at times however with the\nright approach they can be managed\nremember the bottom up trauma process we\ndiscussed earlier apart from explaining\nhow trauma develops the bottomup process\ncan also be used in recovery in her\nYouTube video trauma psychotherapist\nAmanda Anne Gregory discussed the\nconcept of bottomup treatment approaches\nfor trauma she explained that bottom-up\napproaches focus on addressing the first\nand second parts of the brain reptilian\nand mamalian as she explains these are\nthe parts where trauma usually lives\nespecially in cases of Developmental\ntrauma and complex trauma bottom-up\ntherapies are designed to help rewire\nthe brain in a way it aims to delete\nthat pathway from The Reptilian Brain to\nthe neocortex which triggers travel\nthrough instead you learn to listen to\nyour body and feel your emotions in a\nsafe setting once you feel safe with\nyour trauma you can start learning a new\ncoping mechanism and by coping in a\nhealthy way with your triggers you'll\nslowly start to realize ize that past\ntriggers can't hurt you anymore it's\nimportant to remember that healing from\ntrauma takes time and effort and it's\nokay to not have all the answers right\naway your brain went through a lot and\nit deserves kindness love and time to\nrewire the pathways that cause you to be\nstuck in the past please don't be afraid\nto reach out for help whether it be from\nfriends family or a professional you\ndeserve to be free of your triggers and\nto live fully in the present moment and\ndon't forget you matter"
