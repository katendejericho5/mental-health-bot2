    "transcript": "on this channel we've talked a lot about\nthe subtle signs that can help us tell\nif someone likes us or is romantically\ninterested in us but what about the\nopposite have you ever met someone who\nacted polite with you but you just\ncouldn't shake the feeling that they\nwere only pretending or thought you were\nfriends with someone or only to find out\nthat your feelings were entirely\none-sided if you answered yes to either\nthen you've probably wondered what are\nsome ways we can tell if someone\ndislikes us even if we don't think so or\neven if they tell us they don't well\nlucky for us psychology is here to help\nand over the past few years there's been\nplenty of studies on the subtle signs\nthat someone secretly dislikes us that\ncan help us better navigate our\nfriendships and social lives so without\nfurther Ado here are seven psychology\nbacked signs to keep an eye out for if\nyou're trying to figure out whether or\nnot someone secretly dislikes you number\none make you wonder intuitively if\nyou're starting to get the feeling that\nsomeone doesn't like you even if on the\nsurface it seems like they do it might\nbe worth looking into because those\nfeelings don't just come from out of\nnowhere in their study understanding the\nexperience of pure rejection researchers\nsandram and zisy noted that even when\nthe rejection was never outrightly\nstated or expressed participants could\nstill feel it in their gut somehow that\nthe other person didn't like them number\ntwo non-verbal language you know when\nsomeone is attracted or interested in\nyou you can tell by their non-verbal\ncues and Body Language right well we can\ndo the same to pick up on their secret\ndislike of us according to Jo Naro\nformer FBI agent body language expert\nand author of the dictionary of body\nlanguage closed off body language like\ncrossed arms crossed legs distance and\nshifting eye contact can all indicate a\nlack of respect and attention more\nsubtle signs also include pointing their\nfeet or facing away from you when\ntalking to you discreetly taking the\ntime repeatedly looking over your\nshoulder and a distinct lack of physical\ncontact number three act differently\nanother Telltale sign that someone\ndoesn't like you is if they act\ndifferently around you than they do with\nother people so take notice of how they\ninteract with you compared to how they\nare with their close friends are they\nmore polite more guarded or more CT with\nyou do they not laugh as much or crack\nas many jokes do they seem to be walking\non eggshells around you well it's true\nthat it's quite typical for us to act\nthis way around people were not close to\nor don't know very well researchers\nlansu cesen and Bowski have also found\nthat these are all signs of something\nthey call implicit peer evaluation which\nmeans they act differently around you\nbecause they're still assessing whether\nor not they can trust you or want to be\nfriends with you and if they've been\nacting this way for a long while now\nthen it's probably because there are\ncertain things about you they dislike\nnumber four backhanded compliments does\nyour so-called friend often give you\nsnid remarks and backhanded compliments\nor saying you make signals with their\npassive aggressiveness only to insist\nthat nothing is wrong behaviors like\nthis indicate that there might be some\nlingering resentment between you and\nyour friend and we all know that nothing\nruins a friendship faster than holding\non to past grudges and refusing to ever\ntalk about it according to a study by\nDey white and vanum they might also be\nmore irritable around you and want to\nspend less time with you for this very\nreason number five self-absorbed\nconversations if there's some someone in\nparticular you want to know secretly\ndislikes you think back to your last few\nconversations with them what do you\nusually talk about if the answer is\nusually them and what's going on in\ntheir lives then it's probably safe to\nassume that this person dislikes you why\nwell according to communication expert\nam maravian who published a study in\n2017 titled communication without words\none-sided and self-absorbed\nconversations signal that this person\ndoesn't actually like you as a person\nbut rather the attention you pay to them\nnumber six social exclusion have you\never found out that your friends got\ntogether and went somewhere without you\nor that they threw a party and forgot to\ninvite you no matter how good their\nexcuses might seem if it keeps happening\nagain and again then it's intentional\nsocial exclusion and according to a\nstudy by Kellen Rutland and J Paul when\nsomeone socially excludes you it means\nthat they either dislike you don't\nreally consider you a friend or are\nfriends with someone who dislikes you\nnumber seven M calls or left on red last\nbut certainly not the least if you want\nto know how someone really feels about\nyou check your phone history with them\nhow many M calls did they never return\nhow many times did they leave you unre\nor delivered according to researchers\nYap Francisco and gopz who published a\nstudy in 2021 titled from best friends\nto silent ends exploring the concepts of\nghosting and non-romantic relationships\nin this day an age of constant\nconnectivity there's really no excusing\nthis kind of behavior anymore sure they\nmight just just need their space or\nmight be feeling socially drained at\ntimes but when it's just you that they\nseem to ghost then it means they've\neither already lost interest or never\nhad it in the first place so do you\nrelate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here did going through these\nsigns bring to mind anyone in particular\nthey say that ignorance is bliss and it\nmight feel that way if having your eyes\nopen to these signs hurt you but trust\nus it's always better to know who your\ntrue friends really are and if there's\nsomeone in your life right now that\nsecretly dislikes is only pretending to\nbe your friend or harboring ill feelings\ntowards you then you're better off\ndistancing yourself from these people\nand not forcing them to like you know\nyour own worth nurture the positive\nrelationships in your life and let go of\nthe things you can't control like how\nsomeone feels about you if you think\nthere are some signs we missed let us\nknow in the comments below what do you\nthink is the best way to tell if someone\ndislikes us"
