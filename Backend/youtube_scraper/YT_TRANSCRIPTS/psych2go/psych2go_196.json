Aronson\ndiscovered the pratful effect this type\nof bias showed that the people\nconsidered Superior by others tended to\nbe more likable or attractive when\nshowing weakness in one of aaronson's\nexperiments this weakness took the form\nof an everyday blunder such as spilling\ncoffee over oneself this small mistake\nhumanized people who seemed to be\nsuperior like managers teachers or\nparents and thus made them more likable\nlet's be honest who doesn't love a good\nblooper reel at the end of a show or\nmovie it's kind of nice to know perfect\npeople mess up too right\ndress to
