determine\nwhich behaviors you will tolerate and\nwhich you won't for example The\nNarcissist May frequently call you\nderogatory names you know this is\nunacceptable so you draw dra the line\nand say you'll end the conversation\nuntil the narcissist can be\nrespectful be firm licensed mental\nhealth counselor bisar anoa revealed\nthat it is inadequate to only establish\nyour boundaries with a narcissist\nwithout following through with what you\npromise to do when your boundaries are\nviolated as the saying goes actions\nspeak louder than words for example when\nyou are personally attacked by The\nNarcissist tell them that you are done\nwith the conversation then simply leave\ndon't succumb to their Relentless\nbadgering or continued attempts to gain\nthe upper hand walk the talk and begin\nadvocating for your own needs instead of\nalways caving into their sense of\ngrandiosity gray rocking imagine\nyourself walking alongside a stream and\nyour eyes fixate on a gray rock you\nthink to yourself how indistinguishable\nthis one rock is from numerous other\nrocks laying around have you ever wanted\nto avoid attracting a narcissist to\nattention then perhaps becoming a gray\nrock could seem like a smart move\nobviously humans cannot transform into\nrocks but this is where the concept of\ngray rocking originates from licensed\nmarriage and family therapist Dr Carol\nMcBride says that narcissists thrive on\nconflicts to gain control over you they\nwant to provoke a response from you and\nseeing you being dramatic makes their\nday therefore when practicing the gray\nrock method you prevent the narcissist's\nmanipulation by keeping all of your\nencounters as monotonous as possible\nkeep the interactions short and give\none-word answers like yes no or I don't\nknow whenever you\ncan understand narcissism according to\ntherapist CLA Jack the wounds that\nnarcissists receive early in life cause\nthem to belittle and Bully others\nnarcissists often lack self-awareness to\nprotect ourselves from narcissists we\nmust first understand the underlying\ncause of their behavior due to the\npsychological wound they've dedicated\ntheir whole lives attempting to conceal\nthe narcissistic wound if you do\nanything to urge them to unravel the\nlayers they may perceive you as the\nenemy never try to fix or change a\nnarcissist know that change is only\npossible if the narcissist is willing to\nexamine their role in causing trouble\nfor themselves and others it's not about\nyou picture this your partner is driving\nwhen he suddenly notices that he's\ndriving over this speeding limit now he\nis upset because he is sure that you\nwill receive a speeding ticket he blames\nYou by saying I wouldn't have been\npreoccupied and got a speeding ticket if\nyou hadn't constantly asked me questions\nThe Narcissist cannot accept the\nresponsibility because doing so would\nrequire them to regard themselves as\nhuman beings capable of making mistakes\ntherefore they will always paint\nthemselves as the victim and shift the\nblame onto someone else their sense of\ngrandiosity will not give Credence to\nthe notion that they they can be\nimperfect in some way licensed\nprofessional counselor Dr nak pangi\nThomas says that when a narcissist\nblames you remind yourself that you are\nnot at fault keep in mind that your\nboundaries are crucial especially\nminimizing what you are responsible for\nin their life it can be daunting and\nstressful to navigate a relationship\nwith a narcissist however know that you\nare not alone and understand that you\nhave the power to protect yourself and\nreclaim your peace if you don't believe\nyou are capable of healing and moving on\nafter the abuse it is important that you\nseek professional help do you think\nyou'll put any of these protection\nsuperpowers into practice let us know in\nthe comments and remember you matter"
