    "transcript": "have you ever heard of the term covert\nnarcissist\nmaybe you're wondering how a narcissist\ncan be covert in the world of Clinical\nPsychology someone who has been\ndiagnosed with narcissistic personality\ndisorder NPD is characterized by a\ngrandiose sense of self-importance a\ndeep-seated need for praise and\nattention and a lack of empathy for\nothers\ncovert narcissism or otherwise known as\nshy vulnerable or secret narcissism is a\nsubtype of narcissism that is often\nharder to spot because of its less\npronounced features and behaviors\npeople who are secret narcissists are\nnot as outwardly arrogant entitled or\nself-centered as other narcissists and\ninstead of being charming and\nmanipulative they may be more anxious\nreserved and sensitive psych2go is on a\nmission to make mental wellness and\npsychology more accessible to the world\nbe sure to leave a question in the\ncomments and we'll try to reply back\nokay without further Ado here are seven\nwarning signs you need to look out for\nthat tell you if someone is secretly a\nnarcissist number one they're very\nsensitive to criticism\nhave you ever offered someone some\nsuggestions and they took them\npersonally narcissists have a grandiose\nself-image they think of themselves as\nthe best at everything they do and\nPractically Perfect in every sense of\nthe word\nand it's because they think so highly of\nthemselves that it stings so much for\nthem to ever be criticized even over the\nlittlest things\nthey will feel as if you've insulted\nthem in the worst way possible\nnarcissists take everything personally\nso to them even the most constructive\nfeedback can feel like a harsh\nhumiliation\nnumber two they don't take no for an\nanswer oh come on would it really be so\nbad what do you have to lose\ndo they say it with a smile and a nudge\nuntil you've given\nanother defining trait narcissists share\nis the Relentless need to always have\ntheir way and get what they want and\nthough will covert narcissist may try to\nact more polite or friendly about it\nthey never take no for an answer they\ndon't care what reasons you have for\nsaying no whether it inconveniences you\nor makes you uncomfortable because the\ntruth is narcissists only care about\nthemselves so they don't bother trying\nto consider other people's thoughts or\nfeelings\nnumber three their motivation is always\nfor self-gain\nhave you ever met someone who only makes\nfriends with people they can benefit\nfrom they don't ever do anything if\nthere isn't something in it for them\nthey may help you out if you offer them\na reward or act kind and sympathetic if\nthey think it'll help them gain praise\nfrom others but at the end of the day\nthey don't really do anything for anyone\nbut themselves covert narcissists May\npretend to empathize with you as they\nlisten acting like they care about you\nand your problems but unless your\nconversation is about them they will\nmost likely just tune you out and wait\nfor their turn to talk number four they\nact passive aggressively\nnarcissists are masters of emotional\nmanipulation especially those trying\nhard to appear as though they're not\ncovert narcissists tend to have a lot of\npassive aggressive behaviors to conceal\ntheir more undesirable nature to others\ncommon examples include subtly blaming\nothers for their mistakes by saying if\nonly someone had known what to do\nthey may be hurtful jokes that are half\nmen like what it was just a joke also\ngiving backhanded compliments like I\nonly like you because you're pretty\nnumber five they are easily envious of\nothers\nnarcissists are constantly comparing\nthemselves to others because they're\nobsessed with being the best and want to\nfeel Superior to everyone else and when\nthey feel someone has outdone them in\nsome way or has something that they lack\nthey often become bitter resentful and\nenvious of the other person\nand though a covert narcissist may never\nexpress such feelings out loud to others\nyou can tell by the way they never seem\nhappy for anyone else's success\nnumber six they tend to hold a lot of\ngrudges they always have to have the\nlast word period\nsomeone who is secretly a narcissist May\nhold grudges for a long time even\nagainst their closest family and friends\nthis is because when they feel like\nsomeone has treated them unfairly or\nhurt their feelings in some way they\nhave trouble letting their anger go\nthey are spiteful and vindictive often\nin the most cunning of ways and simply\nwait for an opportunity to exact revenge\non the people they feel have wronged\nthem they always want everyone to side\nwith them in an argument then look for\nways to turn other people against their\nenemies by spreading rumors about them\nor ruining their image and number seven\nthey have difficulty with empathy are\nthey there for you even if there's\nnothing in it for them are they a true\nfriend to you or do they simply see you\nas a means to an end the trick to\nspotting a covert narcissist lies in\nlooking at their actions instead of\ntheir words covert narcissists are\ntrying to hide a callous lack of empathy\nfor others they're very good at tricking\npeople into thinking that they care with\ntheir fake laughs and empty words and\ninsincere apologies of course it's\nimportant to always keep in mind that\nonly qualified Mental Health Care\nProfessionals can diagnose someone with\na psychological condition such as\nnarcissism\nbut if you've noticed these traits and\ncharacteristics in a friend or family\nmember encourage them to seek help from\na therapist and consider counseling for\nyourself as well knowing the signs that\nsomeone may be a narcissist can help you\nlook out for problematic behaviors\nrelationship Dynamics and even abuse of\nany kind from this person later on down\nthe line we hope we were able to give\nyou insight into
