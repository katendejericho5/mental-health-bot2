people in your\nlife and how\nwhat is a toxic person\na toxic person is someone who displays\nself-centered manipulative and\ncontrolling Behavior they can often be\nhard to communicate with this can go\nbeyond surface level behavior and deeper\ninto personal struggles or traumas they\nhave faced that led them down this path\naccording to psych Central toxic\nbehaviors May manifest from underlying\nfeelings of low self-esteem and mental\nhealth conditions such as narcissistic\npersonality disorder childhood trauma or\nother deeply rooted personal issues\nwalking on eggshells when you spend time\nwith someone you should be able to be\nyourself and freely enjoy their company\nwithout having to think twice about what\nyou say or do\nif you find the need to measure their\nmood on the Moodle meter quantify their\nnegativity for the day and formulate a\nprocedure for how careful you have to be\nwith them today just so they won't blow\nup on you and take that as a huge sign\nthat this person could be toxic a\nregular conversation with them shouldn't\nfeel like a mad science lab experiment\nHealthline explains that when you are\naround a toxic person you worry that by\nbringing up problems you'll provoke\nextreme tension so you become conflict\navoidant and keep any issues to yourself\nit's not worth feeling like you have to\nhold your breath in order to keep this\nperson from lashing out at you\nstonewalling does this sound familiar\nevery time you get into a fight they\nclose off and turn away they dismiss\nyour feelings and make you feel\naccountable for their issues\nstonewalling is when a person refuses to\ncooperate or communicate with their\npartner to resolve issues\nthey shut down and withdraw from the\nconversation it may even feel like\nthey're building up a wall between\nthemselves and you almost an extreme\nsilent treatment sound familiar people\ncan Stonewall in relationships for a\nvariety of difficult reasons according\nto the Gotham Institute it can be in a\ndiscussion or argument The Listener\nwithdraws from the interaction shutting\ndown and closing themselves off from the\nspeaker because they're feeling\noverwhelmed or psychologically flooded\nmetaphorically speaking they build a\nwall between them and their partner\nstonewalling is an unhealthy and\nineffective form of communication as\nthere's not much communication happening\nat all and has a destructive effect on\nany relationship\ninconsistency toxic people may be\noverjoyed by the littlest of things\ngoing their way and then irritated the\nnext minute when something goes wrong\nthey can even push these feelings onto\nyou making you feel responsible for\ntheir drastic emotions or wondering why\nyou don't share their perspective\npsychiatrist and author Abigail Brenner\nMD explains in an article with\nPsychology today that toxic people may\nchange their perspective attitude and\nbehavior depending on what they feel\nthey need to accomplish or what they\nwant to have happen\nit's difficult to know how they may\nreact to a situation due to their\nunpredictable Behavior\nyou feel guilty do you feel\nuncomfortable when focusing on yourself\ndoes this person make you feel like you\ndon't do enough or are undeserving of\ntaking a break that you really need\ntoxic people put down their victims when\nthe attention is not on them or their\nneeds anymore a psychology today\nexplains there are not caring supportive\nor interested in what's important to you\nin fact the good things that happen to\nyou move the attention away from them\nand thwart them from focusing on their\nown goals\nif someone is keeping you from taking\ncare of yourself or focusing on your\nneeds it's time to consider walking away\nfrom them\nproblems but no Solutions\never\nanother thing toxic people do is that\nthey tend to focus on the negative side\nof things rather than what's in their\ncontrol this also goes for how they\nhandle disagreements a toxic person\noften fears being called out for their\nunwarranted behavior and puts a tough\nfront to prevent taking accountability\nfor their actions they're pessimistic\nand degrading often finding someone to\nblame when a situation is undesirable as\nForbes explains these types of toxic\npeople actively push away any personal\nresponsibility by making every speed\nbump they encounter into an uncrossable\nMountain they don't see tough times as\nopportunities to learn and grow from\ninstead they see them as an out if this\nperson chooses to not address any\nsituation that concerns you it's a sign\nthat they aren't prioritizing you in the\nright way\nso now you're aware of potential signs\nof a toxic person but you may be\nwondering well what do I do now\ncoming up with an effective

co-parent as\nshared by Healthline if you are dealing\nwith someone who picks fights with you\nor repeatedly pushes your boundaries\nconsiders scaling back the amount of\ntime you spend with them keep the time\nyou spend with this person to a minimum\navoid frequent contact and deal with\nthem only as and when necessary three\nset boundaries you need to protect your\nspace both physical and mental recognize\nwhat it is you will not tolerate from\nanyone draw the lines and make sure that\nyour boundaries are made clear to this\nperson it can be hard to develop\nboundaries for those that are concerned\nwith hurting others feelings while\noverlooking their own needs researchers\nat Berkeley call this the empathy trap\nhowever this is an important life skill\nthat often makes it clear who can show\nyou the respect you deserve Berkeley\nexplains Lanes in successful adult\nrelationships the flow of empathy is\nreciprocal\nPartners share power equally and move\nback and forth between giving and\nreceiving when one partner does more of\nthe giving however resentment is likely\nto build so to help put feelings aside\nit's useful to come up with a strategy\nfor how you will address a
