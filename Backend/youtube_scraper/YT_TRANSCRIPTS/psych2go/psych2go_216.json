    "transcript": "you're trying to love yourself more but\nare you afraid of going overboard with\nit a lot of you resonated with our\nprevious video about self- cuddling and\nhow many of us often mistake self-\ncoddling for self- Lov check out that\nvideo to learn more but what about\nhaving a God complex and why are there\nso many people out there mistakenly\nbelieving that selflove means having a\nGod complex is there such a thing as\nhaving too much self-love let's dive\ndeeper what is God complex someone with\na God complex leans towards megalomania\nwhich is an excessive belief in one's\nown power importance or greatness often\naccompanied by a desire for control and\ndominance in simpler terms having a God\ncomplex basically means when someone\nthinks they're way better than everyone\nelse on the flip side there's self-love\nwhich is all about appreciating and\nvaluing yourself it's crucial to tell\nthem apart why because understanding the\ndifference between the two helps us\nnavigate between healthy confidence and\npotentially problematic behaviors so how\ndo you know whether you or someone else\nhas a God complex well people with a God\ncomplex believe their delusions but\ntheir delusions are often in opposition\nor contrary to evidenced reality despite\nthe evidence megalomaniacs hold on to\ntheir inaccurate interpretations in this\nrespect they are similar to narcissists\nhowever as stated before megalomaniacs\nhave a heightened sense of selfworth\nso here are some of the ways to tell if\nsomeone has a God complex and not\nhealthy self-love one grandiosity\nsomeone with a God complex is someone\nwho's always boosting themselves up at\nthe expense of others they think they're\ntop-notch and deserve special treatment\nlike they're the superhero with all the\npowers kind of like Thanos with his\nInfinity Gauntlet but here's the catch\nthis belief in their own greatness can\nmake them act recklessly they might end\nup in situations where they not only\nhurts elves but also others now let's\ntie this back to self-love see healthy\nself-love is more about appreciating and\nvaluing yourself without thinking you're\nbetter than everyone else it's like\nsaying hey I'm awesome and so are you so\nit's essential to understand the\ndifference having a good dose of self-\nLov is awesome but going on full God\ncomplex mode that's when things become\ntoxic and potentially harmful for\neveryone involved two inflated sense of\nsuperior I ority to some degree we are\nall capable of developing inflated egos\nwe sometimes present ourselves as being\nbetter at something than we really are\nbut some take it to the next level for\nexample we can see it in politicians\nespecially dictators when they make\npromises based on how good honest or\nNoble they or their intentions are they\njustify their actions no matter how\nwrong they might be why because they\ngenuinely believe their powerful\npositions give them the right to make\nthose choices even if they're wrong and\nare hurting others now here's the twist\ngiven the chance many of us might do the\nsame thing feeling all high and mighty\nremember what Uncle Ben said with great\npower comes great responsibility if\nwe're not aware we could find ourselves\njustifying things that are just plain\nwrong remember the Stanford Prison\nExperiment that's a perfect example if\nyou've checked out our video on it drop\nyour thoughts in the comments below\nlet's talk about it sometimes we may be\nwrong and that's okay it doesn't matter\nif you're in a position of power or not\nself-love is being able to acknowledge\nthat you're wrong when you are and being\nable to accept and integrate the shame\nthat comes with it to become a better\nperson three excessive confidence being\nconfident is great but when does it\nbecome too much confidence well it's\nwhen it turns arrogance and totally not\ncaring about what others feel and say\nfor example someone with excessive\nconfidence won't even think about\ndifferent opinions and believes their\nown ideas are always the best the truth\nis having self-love and true confidence\nmeans understanding your worth yet\nstaying open to what others bring to the\ntable it's not about shutting people\ndown it's about building each other up\nand considering other people's thoughts\nand\nfeelings four dictator disguised as a\nhero ever met someone who acts like\nthey're the savior of the group but ends\nup behaving a bit like a dictator you\nknow they present themselves as the hero\nbut at the same time they ignore what\nothers need or or want it's like they've\ngot this overly big idea of themselves\nand because of that they're rude and\ndisrespectful to everyone else it's like\nhaving a friend who thinks they're the\nsuperhero but forgets That We're All in\nThis Together does this sound like you\ntrue self-love is more like having\nconfidence without stepping on others\nit's appreciating and valuing yourself\nwithout thinking you're the only hero in\ntown five feels insulted when ignored if\nyou find yourself getting really upset\nwhen others don't acknowledge your\nsuccess or qualities it could be a sign\nof a God complex megalomaniacs think\nreally highly of themselves and when\nthey don't get recognized they take it\npersonally this kind of behavior is also\ncommon in narcissists because both\ngroups crave attention and\nacknowledgement from others like they\nneed constant validation true self-love\ndoesn't rely on external validation it\ncomes from within yourself appreciating\nyour worth without depending on others\nto constantly validate or applaud you\nit's about finding that confidence and\nvalue from your own beliefs rather than\nseeking it from the outside so what\ncauses someone to develop a God complex\naccording to statistics on delusional\ndisorder people have different ideas\nabout where a God complex comes from\nsome think it could be linked to\nbiological factors like substance abuse\nor medical conditions that affect the\nbrain areas dealing with emotions and\nbehavior this idea comes from looking at\nsimilar disorders in paranoid\nschizophrenic patients another thought\nis that a God complex might develop from\nstruggles with low self-esteem feelings\nof powerlessness or unresolved childhood\nproblems other researchers say that\nsuper sensitive people might use defense\nmechanisms like projection and denial to\nstick to their delusions some\npsychologists suggest that how a person\nis brought up can also play a role for\ninstance if a child is constantly\npraised without facing consequences for\ntheir actions they might develop a God\ncomplex never learning to take\nresponsibility\nregardless of how or where it originates\na God complex can bring along mental\nhealth issues along with frustrations\nand broken relationships having a God\ncomplex puts a wall between the\nindividual who has it and who they\ninteract with so how do you treat it the\nbest treatment for a God complex is\ndeveloping awareness of your behaviors\nand emotions learning to manage your\nemotions can not only make you aware of\nyour own emotions but of other people's\nas well emotional intelligence can help\nyou connect with others and may diminish\nany feelings of superiority tell us we'd\nlove to hear your opinion on God\ncomplexes and if you've learned anything\nnew if you like this video let us know\nby clicking the thumbs up button and\nsubscribing to our Channel see you next\ntime P to go\nis"
