that\nno one knows better than you know\nyourself other people's opinions of you\nwon't always reflect the whole picture\nand that's okay so if anybody builds a\npicture of you based on superficial\nthings it's up to them to change their\nminds not you emotions according to\npsychotherapist John Amadeo self-loving\npeople are gentle towards the emotions\nthat develop inside them when you love\nyourself you understand that it's\nnatural to feel sad upset and scared\nsometimes instead of seeing emotions as\na sign of weakness you view it as a\nsymbol of strength getting in touch with\nyour emotions allows them to become\nfriendly allies rather than enemies of\nyour life Journey you might begin to\ndiscover the messages your emotions are\ntrying to convey as you approach

a\npreliminary analysis the self-focused\nGratitude group experienced more sense\nof redemption and felt that they were\nmorally good people\nforgiveness forgiveness is simply about\nunderstanding that every one of us is\nboth inherently good and inherently\nflawed Desmond 22 have you ever realized\nthat you made a huge mistake and the\nnext thing you know you are greeted with\npainful negative emotions like shame and\nguilt when you love yourself you realize\nthat you're just human there will be\ntimes you say things you didn't mean to\nsay make bad judgments and do things\nthat fall short of your moral standards\npsychology researchers Lydia woodette\nand colleagues explained that self\nforgiveness rids the self of negative\nemotions and cultivates self-compassion\nlove and kindness
