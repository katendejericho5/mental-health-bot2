unintentionally when\nyou've picked up bad habits over time\nbut being aware of this issue is the\nfirst step and can even help you Salvage\nmany different social situations\nincluding in the bedroom if you're\nwondering how to ditch bad habits and\nmaximize your confidence then keep\nwatching why so sweaty is it hot in here\nor is it just your anxiety running up a\nsweat we've all been there but a sweaty\nface and hands are a dead giveaway of\nanxiety and nervousness and can be a\nturnoff anxiety can trigger your nervous\nsystem to go into fight or flight mode\nwhich increases your heart and breathing\nrate and can lead to sweating this means\nduring an intense sexual moment you\nmight just look like you got out of a\nrainstorm and can signal to the other\nperson that you're more stressed and\nnervous than anything else instead of\nexcited to share the moment with them\nhow can you fix this it's okay to take a\nmoment to yourself to breathe and even\nget some water if you're feeling too\nanxious excusing yourself briefly can\ngive you a moment to recoup and there's\nno shame in that if you don't take a\nmoment to yourself it could actually end\nup making your anxiety worse slouch\npotato okay no lie the name does sound\nkind of cute but believe me slouching is\nnot and can be a major turn off\nslouching gives off the impression that\nyou're not interested or invested in the\nmoment and can even signal to the other\nperson that you don't want to be there\nit can even lead them to believe that\nyou're disinterested or not sexually\nattracted to them clearly this is not an\nissue if you're with someone that you\ntruly don't want to be around but what\nif it's your crush or even someone you\ngenuinely care about that's not the\nimpression you'd want to give off how do\nyou fix this to elimate minate the bad\nhabit of slouching you have to make an\neffort to constantly remind yourself\nthat it's a bad habit and change your\nmindset around it what does this mean\nwell when you gradually develop a bad\nhabit it becomes ingrained\nsubconsciously and you start to do it\neven without realizing it you know that\nslouching isn't attractive but now it's\nsomething you do unconsciously because\nit's ingrained in your behavior to fix\nthis you need to be hyper aware of it\nduring social situations especially\nright before seeing someone else this\nwill gradually train your brain to\nremind itself hey stand up straight the\nsame way you pick up a bad habit is the\nsame way you pick up a good habit by\nchanging your mindset and doing\nsomething over and over again until it\nbecomes rooted in your unconscious\nBehavior tension and stiffness an\nintense sexual moment can inevitably\ncause someone to be nervous and as a\nresult you may freeze up a bit your\nmovements may appear almost robotic\nbecause because you're not relaxed or\ngoing with the flow and it's noticeable\nwhen you're interacting with someone\nelse the other person may be trying to\nconnect with you emotionally and\nsexually during the moment but you're as\nstiff as a mannequin and it could\ncompletely kill their interest in you\nhow to fix this take a deep breath and\nlet the other person take the lead if\nyou're struggling with negative selft\ntalk that's leading you to be stiff or\ntense a great strategy is to let the\nother person take charge during a sexual\nencounter or moment this will allow you\nto relax and lose yourself in the moment\nrather than focusing on yourself or even\nperformance anxiety which refers to\nanxiety caused by stress or worry about\nperforming adequately during sexual\nactivity remember when you're extremely\nnervous or anxious your body responds by\nreleasing the dreaded stress hormones\nsuch as epinephrine and norepinephrine\nand it will only make your stiffness\nworse if you lay back and allow the\nother person to lead then you can take a\nmoment to get comfortable and focus on\nwhat they're doing rather than worrying\nabout how you're being\nperceived distracted Behavior you're\nwith someone and things seem to be\nheating up the moment is perfect but\nthen you start fidgeting with your hands\nand your eyes are darting back and forth\nthese examples of distracted Behavior\ncan kill sexual tension and attraction\nbecause you aren't present in the moment\nusually this is due to various reasons\nsuch as anxiety or just being easily\ndistracted but it comes off as rude and\ndisinterested worse it can even seem\nthat you're not attracted to the other\nperson you're spending time with which\ncan cause Grievances and\nmisunderstandings you don't need how to\nfix this practice mindfulness it's easy\nto get lost in your own thoughts\nespecially when you're nervous but if\nyou take a deep breath and remind\nyourself that your raising thoughts are\nonly going to make your anxiety worse it\ncan truly make difference mindfulness\ncan be a vital tool to avoid being\noverly critical of yourself while also\nidentifying and managing your emotions\nso do you guys relate to any of the\nhabits mentioned above if you like this\nvideo make sure to check out six
