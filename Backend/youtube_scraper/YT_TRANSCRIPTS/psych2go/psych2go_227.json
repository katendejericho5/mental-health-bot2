    "transcript": "do you have a crush and you don't want\nto screw things up here are the five\nmost important things to avoid if you\nwant to win your crush don't you dare\nmake these mistakes if you are you're\nruining your chances by\n100% trying to win your crush yeah this\nmay sound like a paradox but the truth\nis the harder you try the weirder you'll\nbe around them see when you try too hard\nyour crush can sense that this can make\nthem think two things one they might\nthink you you have an agenda imagine\nyourself in your crush's shoes for a\nsecond think about that one time someone\nreally liked you but for some reason you\ndidn't like them back they follow you\naround they show up where you are they\nopen doors for you or maybe they say\nreally nice things about you in the end\nyou rejected them and you want to avoid\nthem even more because you feel\nsomething is off this is exactly what\nhappens when you are overly too try hard\nthe better approach is just to give them\nspace and wait for them to initiate\nsomething or hint something well if they\nnever do then you know they were never\ninterested to begin with and you can\nmove on two doing what they expect\nspeaking of not being too eager you\ndon't want to do exactly what 90% of\npeople are already doing to win their\nattention perhaps some people enjoy\nbeing put on a pedestal but they won't\nbe interested in you they may continue\nto talk to you but for different reasons\nto use you for validation and to make\nthem feel better about about themselves\nso it's better to be yourself and treat\nthem like a regular person not someone\nyou have to impress or make them feel\nspecial this brings us to our next Point\nputting them on a pedestal stop making\nthem seem more important than they are\nespecially if you don't know them well\nyet how do you know if they are worth\nbeing put on a pedestal if you think\nyour crush is perfect and way better\nthan you it can make you feel like\nyou're not good enough and when you feel\nthat way you might start acting unsure\nof yourself around them and they can\ntell you're not feeling confident\nremember we are Human After All and it's\nnormal to have strong emotions for\nanother person when that happens it's\nbetter to see your crush as a friend you\nlike not someone way above you that way\nyou can have a more equal and genuine\nconnection revealing your feelings too\nfast when you do this again two things\nwill happen one they will immediately\nthink you're needy and want to avoid you\nespecially when you don't know them well\nand you tell them you like them they may\nthink you only like them for their looks\nand not who they are two some of them\nkeep you around and string you along\nbecause they just want validation so\ndon't ever make this common mistake\nunless you enjoy being their backup plan\nsending them multiple text messages if\nyou're texting your crush and they don't\nanswer quickly it's not a good idea to\nsend lots of messages in a row this can\nmake you seem too needy and desperate\nthey might might not reply if you do\nthat the infamous negging you might be\nwondering what is that well negging is\nwhen you say something mean or teasing\nto someone to make them feel bad about\nthemselves that sounds like a dumb\nstrategy but believe me when I say this\na lot of people make this mistake\nunconsciously and don't even realize it\nfor example someone might say you're\npretty cool for someone who's not into\nfashion but your outfit is interesting I\nguess why do people do this well when\nsomeone us uses negging on a crush they\npoke fun at their insecurities and it\ncreates a challenge for the other person\nto prove themselves or gain their\nattention kind of like the Uno reverse\ncard but this is a very toxic way to win\nsomeone over because you're exploiting\nsomeone else's vulnerability generally\nthis will only backfire because it can\nhurt their feelings and they might feel\nupset or self-conscious you'll only\ncreate a negative impression and they\nmight not want to be around you so don't\ndo it not honoring your selfworth if\nyou've told them you like them and they\ntell you they just want to be friends\nit's a good idea to stop trying why\nbecause if you keep texting them after\nthey say no it means you have feelings\nfor them but they don't this creates an\nunfair power Dynamic that will only turn\ntoxic in the long run if you keep doing\nthis they might only keep you around in\ncase they need something or to gain\nvalidation from you did you find these\ntips helpful are you guilty of any of\nthese mistakes share your thoughts and\nexperiences in the comments below and if\nyou think someone might benefit from\nthis video don't hesitate to share it\nwith them until next time thanks for\nwatching"
