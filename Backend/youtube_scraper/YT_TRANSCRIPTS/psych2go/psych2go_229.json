it can\nhelp you reveal what their true\nintentions are here are seven valuable\ntricks to read anyone from head to toe\nnumber one micro Expressions these\nfacial expressions are defined as Tiny\nfacial movements involving the muscles\naround your eyes and mouth these are\nsplit-second involuntary Expressions\nthat are a window to a person's genuine\nthoughts and feelings even when they're\ntrying to hide them PhD Professor Susan\nwhitbourn explains how vital micro\nexpressions are to reading someone micro\nExpressions can completely contradict\nthe impression you're trying trying to\ncreate by what you're saying here's an\nexample let's say you're talking to one\nof your friends and you ask them for\ntheir opinion on your outfit you look at\nthem and they say that outfit looks\ngreat on you and then for a brief second\nyou catch them giving you the dreaded\nside eye they just did this\nunintentionally but it's a signal of\nwhat they're truly thinking sorry but\nyour friend is not feeling that\noverpriced outfit you just bought from\nZara if you watch the show Real\nHousewives you probably see this caddy\ndisplay of weakness all the time so\nalways pay attention to a person's\nfacial expressions the tiniest ones are\nwhere the truth lies no pun\nintended number two The Power of posture\nbelieve it or not a person's posture can\ngive you a good idea about how they're\nfeeling about a particular person or a\nsituation although it's always important\nto listen to a person's words never\nunderestimate the nonverbal cues they're\nsignaling out with their posture for\nstarters when a person walks into a room\npay attention to their head movements\nare they slouching with their head\nslightly lowered or do they have their\nhead held high with a confident and\nPowerful walk like they own the room\nthis is not the strongest indicator of\nself-esteem but it can absolutely give\nyou a glimpse into a person's emotions\nat that given moment speaking of\nemotions always pay attention to a\nperson's arm and hand movements fidgety\nhands can signal nervousness and anxiety\nwhereas crossed arms can signal\ndisapproval and even anger these\nseemingly small movements can speak a\nthousand words so never Overlook them\nnumber three analyze the smile here are\ntwo pictures can you guess which one is\nthe genuine smile and which one is the\nfake smile take a\nmoment if you guess that the one on the\nright was the genuine smile then that's\ncorrect you're good at this a smile can\nmean more than meets the eye there are\nsmall differences between a genuine\nsmile and a fake smile and funny enough\nit starts with noticing a person's eyes\nwhen they smile now let us explain what\ndefines a genuine smile also referred to\nas the duen smile here's the science\nbehind it the duen smile signifies true\nenjoyment and happiness and is\ncharacterized by little wrinkles in the\ncorner of the eyes that form\ninvoluntarily also known as the\norbicularis oculi which is much more\ndifficult to fake or Force on the other\nhand a fake smile only involves\nContracting the muscles around the\ncorners of one's mouth since those can\nbe contracted voluntarily unlike the\ncorners of the eyes next time you're\nhanging out with someone and you're\ncurious to know if they're truly\nenjoying themselves look closely at\ntheir eyes when they smile or even laugh\ndon't let a phony smile fool\nyou number four tone of voice they say\nthat what someone says doesn't matter as\nmuch compared to their tone it's not\nwhat you say it's how you say it Dr\nJudith oloff author and professor of\nPsychiatry at UCLA explains when reading\npeople notice how their tone of voice\naffects you ask yourself does their tone\nfeel soothing or is it abrasive snippy\nor whiny the way someone sounds when\nthey speak to you gives you a true\nGlimpse about how they're truly feeling\nno matter what they trying to say with\ntheir words for example when someone\nsays I'm not angry but they're clearly\nraising their voice in an aggressive\nmanner this proves that they are\nfrustrated to an extent but they're\nrefusing to be forthcoming about it\nunderstanding the in congruence between\nwords and tone is an important skill for\nyour communication Arsenal that can help\nyou read others like a pro number five\nthe eyes Never Lie always watch out for\nwhat someone is non-verbally\ncommunicating with a simple gaze or\nglance of the eyes when someone looks at\nyou straight in the eyes it can mean\nthat they're paying close attention to\nwhat you're saying and taking it in it\ncould also signify arousal according to\nprofessor and author Dr Ronald Rio\nlooking directly into someone's eyes and\nholding that Mutual eye contact for a\nbit longer than what is normal can\nindicate flotation and sexual interest\nthis is a subtle but powerful way to\nread how someone could be feeling about\nyou especially a potential love interest\non the other hand frequent or excessive\neye contact can mean means someone is\ntrying to lie to you yep you heard that\nright contrary to popular belief Liars\ngo out of their way to make more eye\ncontact because of the societal\nstereotype that Liars avoid eye contact\npeople avoid eye contact when they're\nstressed anxious or nervous it doesn't\nmean that they're lying there's no solid\nconnection between lying and eye contact\nunderstanding eye contact or lack\nthereof will actually help you read\npeople better so look for the non-verbal\ncu along with what someone's eyes are\ntrying to tell
