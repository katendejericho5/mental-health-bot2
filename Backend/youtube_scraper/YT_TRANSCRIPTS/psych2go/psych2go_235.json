    "transcript": "It's natural to feel sad sometimes.\nIt's a normal reaction to situations\nthat make you upset.\nBut sometimes it can keep\ngoing on and on for days,\nweeks, or even months\nwith no end in sight.\nIt can impact your everyday life\nand change it for the worst.\nWhen that happens, it's\nno longer just sadness,\nbut depression.\nDepression is not the one single disorder\nwith a specific set of\nsymptoms, but instead,\na continuum of signs going\nfrom mild to more severe.\nBefore we continue,\nthis video is for\ninformative purposes only.\nIt is not intended to diagnose\nor treat any condition.\nPlease reach out to a\nqualified healthcare provider\nor mental health professional\nif you're struggling.\nIf you're wondering if your sadness\nis something more than just sadness,\nor questioning if you might be depressed,\nlook out for some of these signs.\nNumber one, sleeping too much.\nDo you feel like you just\ncan't get enough sleep?\nEither you wake up in the morning\nand go back to bed almost right after,\nor you sleep until the late afternoon.\nSleeping too much during the day,\neven after you've had a full night sleep\nis called hypersomnia,\nand it's one of the most common\nsymptoms of mood disorders,\nincluding depression.\nWhen you feel sad, you\nmight also feel like\nyou don't wanna do\nanything else but sleep.\nYou may also feel like sleep is an escape\nfrom the depressive reality you live in.\nAnd even if you want to get up\nand do stuff, you just can't.\nIt's like you're being\nchained to your bed.\nNot only is this symptom\ndifficult to deal with on its own,\nbut it can also lead to\nsome other health problems,\nwhich include troubles with\nmemory, headaches and migraines,\nweight gain, and heart disease.\nNumber two, social withdrawal.\nSadness can sometimes isolate you\nfrom your friends and family.\nYou might feel like it's hard to hang out\nwhen you're feeling blue, and\nyou'd rather stay in your room\nand listen to your favorite sad playlist\nuntil that feeling goes away.\nBut if you are severely depressed,\nspending time with others\ncan feel like a chore\nyou keep putting off.\nNo matter how much you love\nyour friends, family, partner,\nyou just don't want anyone's company.\nBeing around people can\nfeel suffocating in a way\nbecause you feel like you're\nforced to smile, laugh, talk.\nIt feels as if you have to\nact like nothing's wrong,\nbecause how could they understand?\nYou feel the need to push people away\nand make everyone leave you alone,\neven though deep inside all you want\nis to have someone by your side.\nSocial withdrawal is a trap\nthat depression makes you fall into.\nYou isolate yourself\nbecause it's what you think you need,\nbut it actually makes you feel\nmore lonely and depressed.\nNumber three, poor personal hygiene.\nHave you ever felt too\ntired to wash your hair,\nso you decide to just spray\nsome dry shampoo for the day?\nFor people with severe depression,\nevery day feels like skipping a shower.\nIf you're struggling with your symptoms,\nyou probably feel embarrassed\nto even think about it,\nlet alone talk about it.\nBut this is something that happens\nto many people with depression.\nA global school-based\nstudent health survey showed\nthat girls and boys who\nreported symptoms of depression\nhad an increased likelihood\nof poor hand and oral hygiene,\nincluding washing their\nhands rarely or never,\nand brushing their teeth less than daily.\nThis is one of the obvious signs\nof a severe depressive disorder,\nsince it's visible on the\nbody, not just in the mind.\nIt can be extremely hard\nto brush your teeth,\ncomb your hair, take a\nshower, or wash your clothes.\nThis can happen because you\ndon't have the energy to do it,\nyou're not leaving your home,\nor you may feel like\nthere's just no point.\nNumber four, losing interest\nin hobbies and activities.\nSadness can make you feel unmotivated\nto do things you usually like.\nMaybe you decide you don't\nreally wanna go see that movie,\nor you skip your sports practice.\nWhen you're severely depressed,\nthat feeling goes even further.\nYou almost completely lose interest\nin the hobbies and activities\nthat you used to enjoy.\nIt just doesn't bring\nyou happiness anymore.\nThis can reinforce the lack\nof motivation you feel,\nand it can worsen your\nsymptoms in several ways.\nIt can isolate you from others\nor make you feel like\nyou're not yourself anymore.\nAlso, since you don't\ndo much during the day,\nyou feel bored all the time,\nand boredom leaves you with\ntoo much time for bad thoughts\nthat run through your head constantly.\nThis happens to you because of the way\ndepression impacts your brain,\nmessing up important\nhormones and brain structures\nthat usually help you\nstay active and motivated.\nAnd number five, suicidal thoughts.\nWhen you're feeling sad, you\nmay fantasize about going away\nfor some time, away from the\nsituation that makes you sad,\nand away from the\nworries that trouble you.\nBut if you daydream of being gone for good\nor think about taking your own life,\nthat almost certainly rings the alarm\nand shows you could be suffering\nfrom severe depression.\nWe cannot emphasize enough\nhow serious this symptom is.\nAccording to the 2017 national\nsurvey by the Substance Abuse\nand Mental Health Services Administration,\n4.3% of U.S. adults ages 18 and older\nhad thoughts about suicide.\nAnd the risk of suicidal\nideation gets higher\nfor people with mental disorders.\nAnd this is what makes depression\na potentially deadly disease.\nIt's heartbreaking to see\nanyone feel so much pain\nthat they think dying\nis the only solution.\nBut the thing with depression\nis, it can be treated.\nMedicine and psychology came a long way\nto develop treatment options.\nAnd as other depressive\nsymptoms get under control,\nsuicidal thoughts get under control too.\nIt's important to give treatment a chance.\nIf you or someone you know\nhas suicidal thoughts,\nplease get help right away by\nreaching out to a close friend\nor loved one, or call a\nsuicide hotline number.\nDo you see yourself in\nsome of these signs?\nIf you do, please know that\nthere will always be someone\nto help, and that recovery is possible,\nno matter how hard or\nunbelievable it may seem.\nYour doctor or mental health professional\nis here to hear you out,\nexamine the symptoms\nyou're struggling with\nand offer you treatment.\nAsking for help is the\nbravest and the best thing\nthat you can do for yourself.\nSo don't go through this alone.\nMake sure to like and share this video\nif you think it will help someone else.\nThe studies and references used are listed\nin the description below."
