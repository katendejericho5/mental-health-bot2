    "transcript": "dating apps have changed the way we seek\nand find love one would imagine that it\nhas made it easier to find your soulmate\nor forever person you simply log on from\nthe comfort of your home and search the\ninternet for the person you believe is\nthe most similar to you perfect right\nwhat if I told you that the advertised\nubiquity of love in social media has\nmade it much more difficult to find that\none person who you might spend the rest\nof your life with how is that possible\nfind someone among the Myriad of people\nhas been made easier through social\nmedia but with all these options\navailable we end up wanting to try them\nall not seriously committing to one so\nwe end up stumbling through\nrelationships suffering heartbreak after\nheartbreak and believing it's some kind\nof right of passage in the end it's easy\nto think that the more relationships we\nstumble through the more we learn\nhowever have you ever wondered if a\ndifferent approach might be a better\nanswer there has to be a better way in\nthe past courting and arranging\nmarriages were used to ensure a good\nmatch while these methods are practiced\nin certain cultures it's not common in\nWestern Society but should we adopt them\nagain would they work in our current\nfast-paced Lives who knows so in what\nways is the dating World\nbroken too many choices the plethora of\ndating app\nsuch as hinge Bumble Tinder and OK Cupid\nhave widened the dating pool now you can\nmeet people outside of your immediate\ncircle and hopefully date but have you\nnoticed that the more choices and\npotential Partners you have the more\ndifficult it becomes to actually pick\none the phenomenon is called the Paradox\nof choice you would think that the more\noptions the better wrong the Paradox of\nchoice states that the more choices that\nare available the more more effort it\ntakes to make an actual decision leaving\nus unsatisfied with whatever choice we\nmake this Paradox has been observed in\nmany different fields ranging from\nproduct marketing to design now imagine\nhaving so many choices when it comes to\ndating it's overwhelming primarily\nbecause dating requires a lot of time\ncommitment emotional vulnerability and\nenergy now having to divide those\nresources among several different\npartners is too much much not to mention\nthe variety of dating apps can be\nintense there are at least five really\npopular apps and many more that promise\nyou romantic Bliss which leads us to our\nnext Point superficial connections\nbecause you're juggling between\ndifferent perspective Partners\nsimultaneously or not it becomes\ndifficult to form a real connection what\nis it take to form a real connection\nwith someone time you need time to get\ncomfortable with that person person time\nto know them time to form a bond\nunfortunately many of us stumble through\nonline relationships with expectations\nthat differ greatly from reality\nHollywood movies and online dating\ncampaigns have led us to believe that\nyou need to feel a spark or they have to\nmatch your Vibe but that doesn't happen\ninstantly sure maybe you both click\ninstantly because you like the same\nmusic or take your coffee the same way\nbut that doesn't guarantee a lasting\nrelationship ship at best you stay\nfriends for 3 months however we see\nidealic couples that supposedly met\nonline everywhere but we forget that it\ntook work to make those relationships\nwork some people wish for an idealic\nrelationship but I'm not willing to put\nin time and effort to make their\nrelationships work wanting a perfect\nrelationship and having evidence that it\nis indeed possible many of us enter\nonline dating with high expectations and\nwhen it doesn't work out we become\nfrustrated but the dating World on apps\nis a numbers game the probability of\nfinding your special someone on the\nfirst swipe is incredibly low so if you\ndecide that dating apps is your go-to\nmethod then don't give up if you don't\nmake a special connection right away\nfear of\nvulnerability not only do we make\nsuperficial connections but we are also\nafraid of opening up and being\nvulnerable emotionally online dating\ndoesn't give us the chance to open up\nemotionally or at least be genuine in\nour vulnerabilities we only open up to a\ncertain point because we want to\nmaintain that spark or Intrigue but that\nalso happens in face to-face meetings\ntoo however it is much easier to be\nyourself in front of someone than it is\nto be online is it because expectations\nare too high this disparity between\nonline presence and real life can make\nus hyperfocused in how we are perceived\nand also frustrated with our Partners\nwhen they aren't what we pictured in\nreal\nlife ending up feeling lonelier not only\ndo we feel frustrated but also lonelier\nthis loneliness does not just stem from\nthe inability to make meaningful\nconnections a 2019 study published in\nthe Journal of Social and personal\nrelationships found that people who\nconstantly check dating apps feel\nlonelier why is that is it caused by an\nempty inbox few to no matches well not\nnecessarily the study found a\ncorrelation between loneliness social\nanxiety and measured compulsive use of\ndating apps among college students\nresearchers found that students felt\nmore anxious and lonely after spending\nexcessive time swiping and looking for\none more match that plus an empty inbox\ncan do serious damage to a person's\nself-esteem so what's the solution how\ncan we overcome or circum invent the\nchallenges of online dating the\nResurgence of retro practices such as\nfixed dates has become popular but it\nstill presents unique difficulties while\nfixed dates according were popular and\nsuccessful methods in the 19th and 20th\ncenturies are they useful now whatever\nyour preferred method of dating make\nsure you are being honest with yourself\nand taking care of your mental\nhealth if you liked our video don't\nforget to give us a thumbs up and to\nsubscribe be to our channel for more\ncontent
