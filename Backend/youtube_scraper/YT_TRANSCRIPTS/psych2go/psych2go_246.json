    "transcript": "there are wounds that never show on the\nbody that are deeper and more hurtful\nthan anything that bleeds author Laurel\nK Hamilton do you think that there are\nsome invisible wounds that could hurt us\nand cut more deeply than physical pain\nhave you ever experienced any\nyourself well one that would certainly\ncome to a lot of people's minds is\ntrauma and another would be loneliness\nand often overlooked effect of\nexperiencing trauma psychologists have\nlong since studied the link between\ntrauma and loneliness\nand they found that experiencing a\ntraumatic event in the past can have\nsevere and long-lasting effects on a\nperson for years to come if left\nunresolved so much so that even victims\nof childhood trauma continue to carry\ntheir trauma and its detrimental effects\nwith them well into adulthood according\nto a recent article by rewire and unlike\nthe kind of loneliness we sometimes feel\nwhen we become socially isolated trauma\ninduced loneliness can feel a lot more\noverwhelming because it's rooted in a\nlived experience\nin fact researchers have found that\ntrauma can often become a formative\nmemory so strong that it changes the way\nour brain works it sends our\nself-protective figh ORF flight system\ninto a constant state of high alert and\nheightened emotional reactivity in fact\none study Dr Bremner showed that\npatients with PTSD had a smaller\nhippocampus and anterior singulate\nincreased Ula function and decreased\nactivity in the medial prefrontal and\nanterior singulate psychologists have\nalso found that trauma can also develop\nin us a compulsion to repeat even if we\ndon't realize it see this study by\nVander culk 1989 for more info that's\nwhy so many Children of Divorce later\nend up divorced themselves or victims of\nabusive relationships often find\nthemselves stuck in the same abusive\npatterns even with different partners\nthe bottom line is when it comes to\ntrauma and loneliness the past doesn't\nalways stay where it should with that\nsaid here are some ways trauma can make\nus feel lonely and signs it may be\nhappening to you too number one you\ndon't enjoy the things you used to first\nand foremost trauma can make it hard for\nus to feel positive emotions after being\nin such an intense state of distress\nmany studies such as the one by Hansen\nhave shown this and it's for the same\nreason that more veterans ex-convicts\nand rehabilitated drug users for example\ntend to struggle with reintegration into\nsociety the trauma they experienced\nmakes it difficult for them to regain a\nsense of normaly in their lives and they\noften find themselves changed coming out\non the other side of it they don't enjoy\nthe things they used to anymore and this\nlack of positive reaction and engagement\nin their day-to-day lives can make them\nfeel lonely restless and Confused number\ntwo you're too afraid to take chances\nanymore when studying the psychology of\nrisk-taking researchers Spain and\ncolleagues have found that the more\nsecure you feel about who you are and\nwhere you are in your life the more open\nyou become to challenges and new\nexperiences seems a bit counterintuitive\nright but actually having all these\npositive experiences and relationships\nin your life helps to buffer the pain of\nrejection and minimize the fear of\nfailure people with trauma however are\nthe opposite they become too afraid to\ntake a chance on themselves a new\nopportunity or a new relationship\nbecause they don't think they have the\nemotional resiliency to deal with it\nshould things ever go wrong number three\nyou find it hard to be optimistic\nsimilar to the last Point chaa can make\nus lonier not only by making us limit\nourselves in what we achieve but also by\nmaking us less optimistic and hopeful\nfor the future and according to data\nfrom the mental health center at\ndestination hope victims of trauma can't\nhelp but generalize their traumatic\nexperience into an overall pessimistic\nWorld viw which can then manifest as a\nhabit of self-blame passive helplessness\nand keeping an emotional distance which\nbrings us to our next Point number four\nyou find it hard to connect with people\npeople who have been traumatized often\nfind it hard to trust others and open\nthemselves up again and and if you've\never tried helping someone who's been\nthrough trauma then you perhaps\nrecognize that often times their first\ninstinct is to go into denial and\nself-isolate which only makes their\nloneliness worse this phenomenon has\neven been studied by researchers such as\npy and others number five you feel\nmisunderstood by\neveryone sometimes we can feel our\nloneliest in a room full of people who\nlove us especially when it feels like no\nmatter how hard they try they just can't\nseem to understand but feeling\nmisunderstood is a common experience not\nonly amongst trauma victims but for\nanyone struggling with their mental\nhealth as well and no matter how good\ntheir intentions might be the more they\ntry to understand us and fail the more\nit just hurts and makes us feel more\nalone in our suffering a 2017 study by\nzeligman and colleagues has even shown\nthat this loneliness can hinder our\npost-traumatic growth and number six\nyour trauma still defines a lot of your\nlife finally but perhaps most\nimportantly it can be hard to not feel\nlonely when we feel like our trauma has\ntaken away so much from us already like\nour sense of safety our sense of self\nour optimism and our motivation to\nachieve we struggle to move on from it\nbecause it has come to define a lot\nabout our identity in our life lingering\nin ways we don't even realize\nunexplained symptoms avoidant behaviors\nemotional outbursts these are just a few\nways in which our unresolved trauma can\ncontinue to have an effect on us\neven years after it's all said and done\nas researchers zeligman bio Brock and\nKerney have found the good news however\nis that even the deepest of suffering is\nonly temporary and by surrounding\nourselves with a good support system and\nmaking an effort to seek professional\nhelp we can overcome any loneliness\ngrief or trauma that is keeping us from\nflourishing in life so open up to a\nloved one about your struggles learn\nmore about it and reach out to a mental\nHealthcare expert today connecting with\npeople who have gone through similar\nexperiences such as in a support group\nor group therapy setting can also help\nyou feel less alone whatever small step\nyou choose to take towards healing\nalways remember that moving on doesn't\nmean forgetting and healing doesn't mean\nthe damage never existed it just means\nthat the trauma no longer controls your\nlife because you've learned to grow\naround it in the wise words of author\nHaruki marami of course life frightens\nme sometimes I don't happen to take that\nas a premise for everything
