    "transcript": "there's no way I can do that I can\nbefriend anyone and I'm really good at\nthis\nthese are all examples of beliefs our\nbeliefs about ourselves mean a lot to us\nthey're the lenses that we see the world\nthrough and how we understand its inner\nworkings however like anything our\nbeliefs may not always capture the full\npicture in some ways they can even hold\nus back but with time and understanding\nwe can change how we think about things\nwhich will help Orient us onto a better\npath in this video we'll be looking at\nsix of these beliefs that are holding\nyou back\nnumber one I'm only lovable if I am\nproductive we pride ourselves on what we\ncan accomplish and how fast whether you\npride yourself on knowing your fastest\ntyping speed or have your calendar\nneatly organized for the next month it\nfeels great to know you're productive\nand it's a good thing but what happens\nwhen you inevitably have an off day or\nperhaps you spend a little too much time\nindulging in a non-work activity\nit's easy to feel guilty disappointed or\nashamed of yourself for not getting as\nmuch done as you hoped however it's\nimportant to know that you matter even\nin your dark periods we're all human and\nyou cannot operate perfectly 100 of the\ntime we all need time to recharge and\nsometimes indulging in your favorite\nactivities can give us a much needed\nBreakaway from our work this allows us\nto return so we can do our very best in\nfact according to the Mayo Clinic\nputting an excessive amount of value and\neffort into work can lead to increased\nburnout when you're burned out it\nbecomes difficult to do anything at all\nso go ahead enjoy a nice weekend think\nof your time off as time for you number\ntwo I only deserve love if I'm youthful\nmany people have dreams of becoming a\nlawyer or doctor and that's great a lot\nof us find purpose in a rewarding and\nchallenging job however going into a\ncareer for the wrong reasons and with\nthe wrong mindset can make this more of\na nightmare than a success you are still\nworthy of love no matter how much you\ncontribute as we mentioned earlier the\nMayo Clinic states that putting an\nexcessive amount of value into your work\ncan lead to burnout when you're dealing\nwith burnout you can feel an excess in\nmental health symptoms that can make\nyour day much harder than it needs to be\nwhile it feels good to be useful it's\nunrealistic to be such all of the time\nsometimes you need to put yourself first\nand balance the time you give to others\nwith giving to yourself ultimately you\nwill benefit from this balance in the\nlong term an article from Invictus\nPsychological Services explains that\nfocusing on what you could be and should\nbe doing can lead to resentment when our\nexpectations don't match our reality\nthey state that instead of looking at\nwhat you've done or have not done focus\non gratitude for what you have that may\ninclude friendships Family Health\nopportunities a job a beautiful sunset a\nmeal Etc\nif you find this video relatable and\nhelpful please give the video a thumbs\nup and subscribe to the channel\nmoving on to the next Point number three\neverything has to be perfect or else I\nam a failure we care a lot about doing a\ngood job and looking good at it after\nall it's embarrassing when you mess up\nin front of people\nwhile it's good to be critical of your\nwork and think before you act this can\nbe detrimental if you go too far\nperfectionism is unachievable\nand if you're constantly striving for\nthis standard and cannot seem to reach\nit you can feel like you've failed\nyourself\nthis can make it hard to try for one of\nyour biggest aspirations because you\nthink you'll never make it in a grim\nexample licensed clinical psychologist\nDr Corey Wilkes Saidi asks you to think\nof yourself on the death bed he explains\nthat the most common regret people have\nwhile on their deathbed is not living a\nlife that is authentic to themselves\nthey think of all that they sacrificed\nand missed out on\nultimately even if you don't succeed at\nyour goal it's always worth a try so you\naren't left wondering what could have\nbeen\nnumber four I'm too old to learn\nwe live in a place where age holds a lot\nof value there seems to be a right time\nto do something and a sell-by date to\nsucceed at it however much of this is a\nsocial expectation and not something\nthat is necessarily true an article by\nthe Scientific American discusses\nresearch on this topic they explain that\nolder adults 50 plus can benefit\ncognitively just as much as someone 30\nplus years younger can the article\nfurther discusses a bodybuilder who\nstarted in their late 50s an Innovative\nphotographer at 98 and on a much smaller\nscale how a couple in their 50s became\nprofessional beekeepers in two years\nmuch of what we know about aging and\nmental capacity is more related to\nmaintaining it rather than natural loss\nthink if you don't use it you lose it\nthe brain can be exercised at any age\nand keeping it in use guarantees your\nlongevity so even if you're not in your\n20s or 30s it's never too late to pick\nup a skill that you always wanted to\nlearn\nnumber five I can't be alone\nbeing alone is difficult but it's not\nsomething to be afraid of whether you're\nsettling for Less in a relationship or\nkeeping in contact with a toxic relative\nwe do these things out of fear of not\nhaving them however being alone is not\nall that bad plus while you may think\nthat these situations are keeping you\nalone there are many that will be at\nyour side and can support you in small\nor big ways an article from the learning\nmind explains how bonds with friends can\nin some cases override those you're\nrelated to it's better to surround\nyourself with those who will uplift and\nsupport you rather than put you down\nthis expands to other forms of toxic\nrelationships as well it's best to do\nwhat works for you and while that may be\ndifficult it can involve letting go of\nthose who bring you down and number six\nIt's All or Nothing black and white\neither or these types of dichotomous\nthinking can severely limit you in many\nways while it's easy to try to fit\nthings in categories you miss out on a\nlot of necessary nuances that help paint\na broader picture of what can happen sex\nCentral talks about how this type of\nthinking can severely inhibit what you\ndo and make it easy to compare yourself\nto others fortunately they give a few\nways you can combat this type of All or\nNothing situation one of them is\nbuilding self-awareness of your thinking\nand asking the question what else being\naware of all the alternate possibilities\ncan help you think about your situation\nin a more realistic way things are\nhardly as simple as they appear to be so\ntaking a dive into all the ways your\nsituation can manifest into will help\nbenefit you overall\nwe rely heavily on our beliefs and this\nis a good thing however when our beliefs\nare actually holding us back it may be\ntime to evaluate all of your\npossibilities
