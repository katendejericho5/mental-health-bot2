    "transcript": "what is intelligence this will probably\nopen up a bunch of different opinions\nand answers so the experts have boiled\nit down to the three basic types that\nmake up intelligence as a whole there\nare fluid intelligence where one can\ndetect meaningful patterns grasp\nabstract Concepts and apply it all to\nproblem solving crystallized\nintelligence you might know it as book\nsmarts the stuff taught in classes and\nthe dictionary an emotional intelligence\nbeing able to read people and yourself\nwhen thinking about an intelligent\nindividual we tend to think of people\nwho change the world as we know it we\nthink of greatness then who isn't at\nleast a little curious about whether\nthere is a seat of that greatness within\nthem let's look at some traits that may\ngive you a clue\nnumber one you understand how much you\ndon't know\nSocrates so we meet again\nyes the only true wisdom is in knowing\nyou know nothing the intelligent person\nis intelligent because they know things\nbut it follows that they want to know\nmore things so they're very open and\naccepting that they really don't know\neverything not even close there's so\nmuch more out there they understand that\nat times they don't know what they don't\nknow if someone does the opposite\nconsidering themselves more intelligent\nand proficient than they are thus\nalready knowing more than anyone else\nthey're blocking off the possibility of\nknowledge if the blockage is Extreme\nit's known as the dunning-kruger effect\nand we tend to see those individuals as\nexactly the opposite of intelligent\nnumber two you are insatiably curious\nEinstein knew this and perhaps you felt\nthis too hand in hand with knowing you\ndon't know it all it doesn't mean you're\nnot doing your darndest to try to learn\nit all the vastness of knowledge the yet\nunlearned or yet undiscovered is the\nirresistible compelling pool you're\ndrawn to you ask questions because you\njust need to know or have come up with\nan idea and go down the information\nRabbit Hole to fill in all the blanks on\nhow to realize it perhaps You observe\nothers knowing they experience things\ncompletely different and are just\nitching to learn about them\nsome explanations aren't enough for you\nif someone says this food is good for\nyou you have to know why\nhearing the person simply say over and\nover it just is drives you up the wall\nin fact engaging in meaningful questions\nstimulates your mind encouraging it to\nstay alert and think of other things\nthat may Branch from that question\nnew possibilities arise and thus new\ndiscoveries in new theorems Curiosity\nhas shaped our world for those who say\nbut curiosity killed the cat please\nremember that the whole quote is\ncuriosity killed the cat but\nsatisfaction brought it back number\nthree you are highly adoptable\nyou likely have made plans of some sort\nin your life and like the rest of us\nthose plans often go awry let's face it\nwe live in a small state of chaos the\ntraits of the intelligent person is what\nhappens when that plan goes sideways\nwhile many get overwhelmed freeze up or\nrun around aimlessly the intelligent\nremains calm and lets their brain get to\nwork they understand that there's\nusually more than one Pathway to get to\na goal they'll find or create another\npathway in other words they adapt it's\nbeen found that the behaviors that lend\nthemselves to adaptability are closely\nlinked to EQ and as we all know many\nplans tend to go off the rails due to a\nhuman impetus number four you are a\nferocious reader did you just think I\neat books for breakfast well we just\nhope you didn't mean that literally\nreading has been found to encourage a\ntype of brain tissues growth that allows\nfor improved communication within the\nflourishing of this information leads to\nan increase in all three types of\nintelligence\nbooksmart AKA crystallized intelligence\nincreases when reading non-fiction or\ntextbook if it's fiction following and\ntracking a story narrative and all of\nits themes and being able to apply them\nto the whole increases fluid\nintelligence books also provide a point\nof view an expression of someone else\nhelping you to understand other people\nwhich boosts your emotional intelligence\nnumber five\nyou have high self-control\nthis trait is often demonstrated when a\nperson is described as responsible that\nperson gets things done avoids\nTemptations and sees the big picture\nthey can go against the impulsive desire\nfor instant gratification knowing that\nif they just hold off there's a greater\nlong-lasting reward\nnaturally this isn't an absolute whether\nit be due to a medical condition that's\npoorly controlled or simply a one-off\nreally rough day who may have all gotten\ndistracted before overall though if\nyou're a person whose things that need\ndoing get done where people trust you to\ndo what you say and to not drop the ball\nit's likely that there's a solid core of\nwillpower and self-control at play the\nnumber six you have a sense of humor do\nyou have great comedic timing when you\ntell a joke or make a witty remark is it\nusually assured to land well increasing\nthe smiles and laughter in the room\nit's no wonder that some of the best and\nmost legendary comedians are also\nconsidered highly intelligent people\nthat act of ability is rare and is\nusually a sign of an intelligent person\nthis person has enough Knowledge from\ntheir crystallized intelligence to\ncreate the substance of the humor the\nability to weave the tapestry of the\njoke with their fluid intelligence and\nable to read others to know what will be\nfunny appreciated and not harmful with\ntheir emotional intelligence\ndebate rages on regards to holistic\ndefinitions of intelligence some argue\nthat intelligence is a generalized\nability with a hazy feel to it while\nothers insist that it can be clinically\nmeasured via particular talents or\nskills some also think genetic factors\nhave a massive impact While others\nbelieve nurture takes the Lion's Share\nand the fact we argue this at all is\nuniquely human so how do you feel about\nthese points do you see anything of them\nin yourself or others as we wrap this up\nwe wanted to mention that there has been\na huge decline in mental health around\nthe world which is why we're so\ncommitted to creating more content than\nwe ever have thanks for being a part of\nour journey thanks for watching and\nwe'll catch you again soon"
