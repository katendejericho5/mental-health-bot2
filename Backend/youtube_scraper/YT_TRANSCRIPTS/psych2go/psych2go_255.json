    "transcript": "[Music]\nchemistry is hard and we're not talking\nabout the periodic table making friends\nand finding a partner is difficult and\nfrustrating if only we had a cheat sheet\nthanks to a group of researchers from\nCalifornia State University we kind of\ndo in 2015 the university did a study to\nfigure out what factors needed to be\npresent in order to elicit Chemistry\nBetween the parties through the\nexperiment they found that you need\nMutual honesty mutual interest\npersonableness some similarities and a\nphysical attraction in order to create\nChemistry Between people on top of that\nthey found that those with an agreeable\nor open personality experience\ninterpersonal chemistry more often than\nthose who don't unfortunately we can't\nforce people to like us or want to be\nwith us but we can keep our eyes peeled\nfor the five signs so finding friends\nand partners isn't like chemistry class"
