    "transcript": "you and your friends are getting\ntogether you arrived first one by one\nyour friends show up and everything is\nnormal but the whole time you're looking\nout for that one friend you know the one\nfinally they arrive and suddenly it\ndoesn't just feel like a normal get\ntogether something is different it might\neven feel like tonight is just about the\ntwo of you but the problem is as far as\nyou know you're only friends so today\nwe're looking at a few signs that\nsomeone wants to be more than friends\nwith you they are physically\naffectionate often physical touch is so\nimportant to human beings there are\npeople who are more physical than others\nand a hug or a kiss on the cheek may not\nmean much to them but not everyone is\nlike the characters from The Lord of the\nRings affectionately kissing their\nfriends on the forehead whenever they\nget the chance so if they often find a\nreason to touch your hand shoulder or\neven your face then that might be a sign\nthat they see you as more than just a\nfriend there's a lot you can learn about\nyour friend through how when and why\nthey touch you if they regularly hug\npeople as a greeting then it isn't\nreally significant but if you're the\nonly one they hug then that can tell you\na lot psychologist Dr Matthew\nhartenstein and colleagues conducted a\nstudy in 2006 to find out whether or not\nwe can distinguish emotions through\ntouch they found that we can pick up on\nanger fear disgust gratitude sympathy\nand most importantly love depending on\nhow we are touched so if they high-five\nyou often or carefully share the armrest\nwith you the movies perhaps they're\ntrying to tell you something they always\nchoose to sit with you and focus on you\nif a friend decides to sit next to you\nevery time you hang out that could also\nbe a sign that they want to be more than\nfriends there are a lot of ways to\nexpress attention the most obvious is\nhow they look at you do they maintain\neye contact with you look at you often\nor talk to you more than anyone else you\nmight be getting excited but remember\nthis isn't definitive proof they might\njust be doing so because they're most\ncomfortable with you but you may be able\nto tell the difference psychologist\nSteven lton and colleagues found in\ntheir study published in Trends in\ncognitive sciences that human beings\nexcel at picking up cues through other\npeople's gaze such as widening eyes to\nshow interest in other words we can tell\nquite easily whether we are actually\nholding someone's attention or not but\nthat doesn't tell us everything we need\nto know for that you'll also have to\nlook at what they're like when you're\naart they text you differently texting\nis a relatively new way for human beings\nto communicate there are whole new ways\nto analyze tone and meaning through text\ndeveloping a relationship over social\nmedia has both positive and negative\naspects as pointed out in a 2009 study\npublished in speech communication the\nway we perceive someone as charismatic\nis affected by how they communicate for\nexample someone might seem charismatic\nand flirtatious over text but in person\nkind of dull think about how you text\nsomeone you barely know and compare that\nto how you text your best friends so\nwhat does it look like when someone\nwants to be more than friends they might\nwant to text you more frequently they\nwould come up with any excuse to talk to\nyou their texts could be full of\ncompliments or questions as they try to\nfind out more about what you like if\nyou've been friends for a while they\nmight start dropping hints by asking you\nabout romantic topics using flirty\nemojis and writing long messages next\ntime you're texting ask yourself if the\nthings they're saying are in character\nwould they say the same thing to their\nother friends and this extends to the\nkinds of jokes they make you have your\nown inside jokes ask any couple and they\ncan probably tell you about an inside\njoke they have between them maybe it's a\nnickname or something they do together\noften perhaps your friend has their own\nnickname for you or you frequently have\nyour own inside jokes this could be a\nconscious effort for them to get closer\nto you psychologist Mark shelvin\npublished a 2009 study which found that\nhumor effects mate selection and makes\nus more attractive we also tend to find\npeople we're attracted to to be funnier\nif you've noticed that your friend has\nbeen laughing at everything you say even\nif it honestly wasn't that funny it\nmight be a sign that they're attracted\nto you and want to be more than just\nfriends they get jealous some people\nmight not think of this as a positive\nthing especially if you don't want to be\nmore than friends with the person but if\nthey get jealous when you hang out with\nother people that can tell you a lot\nabout what they think of you the irony\nis that jealousy leads to relationship\ndissatisfaction as found by psychology\nresearcher Dr Rachel aliston and\nAssociates your friends might get\njealous of who you're spending time with\nand while it may not be the healthiest\nBehavior it could be a sign that they\nwant to be more than friends so next\ntime you're with them keep an eye out\nfor some of these signs if you like them\ntoo can you relate to any of these let\nus know in the comments for more videos\nlike this like the video and subscribe\nto Psy too now go out there and spend\ntime with your special friend have fun"
