    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nHaving a bit of trouble determining\nwhether your crush feels\nthe same way about you?\nAre they interested or disinterested?\nHow can you tell?\nNot sure if you should\nconfess your feelings\nto them or ask them out?\nWell, here are five signs your crush\nis disinterested in you.\nNumber one, they don't seem\nparticularly focused on you\nor what you have to say.\nWhen you talk to your crush,\ndo they give you good eye\ncontact, their full focus,\nare they at least listening\nto what you have to say,\nor are they looking around\nthe room, at other people,\nor their phone?\nWell, people generally\nlisten to people they like,\nnot only should they be interested\nin what their crush has to\nsay, but if they like you,\nthey should at least be polite\nand give enough respect to pay attention\nto the conversation\nthey're having with you.\nNumber two, they're always busy.\nHave you texted your\ncrush asking them out?\nDid you see their typing\nicon for like eight years\nand then they finally respond\nwith, \"Nah, I'm busy.\"\nWell, I'm gonna go on a limb here\nand guess that they're not into you.\nIf your crush often lets you know\nthey're too busy to meet up or hang out\nand they never reschedule or\nfollow through with plans,\nit's a good chance they aren't interested.\nWhen someone likes you\nand they're too busy,\nthey'll often give another\ntime or day to get together\nor reach out later asking you to hang out.\nNumber three, you're the one\nstarting all the conversations.\nWho starts most\nconversations, you or them?\nIf they often approach you\nand strike up a conversation,\nthen they're likely interested in you\nas a friend or partner.\nWhen you do talk to them,\ndo they keep the conversation going,\nor seem to avoid talking and\nasking follow up questions?\nIf you're the one initiating\nall the conversations\nand keeping them going, they\ncould be disinterested in you.\nNumber four, your conversations\nare either only professional\nor small talk.\nSo maybe you do have a few conversations,\nbut you notice they\nnever seem to go anywhere\nor they're always just small talk.\nAre they extremely professional\neven though you met them\nat a party or at school?\nWell, if there isn't any\nflirting, playfulness,\nor deeper conversations beyond\nthe topic of the weather,\nthen it's likely they're\nnot the one for you.\nAnd number five, they\ntreat you like their buddy\nor acquaintance.\nHow do they treat their friends?\nHow do they treat their acquaintances?\nPerhaps you've had a chance\nto casually watch how\nthey interact with others.\nDo they treat you like a buddy,\nare they casual with you\nlike everyone else they know,\nor do they get a bit\nnervous around you, blush,\ntry to impress you a bit?\nDoes their vocabulary suddenly\nsound a bit gentler and nice,\nflirty, or it doesn't?\nIf it doesn't, I'm sorry, my friend,\nbut if they clearly\ntreat you like a buddy,\nseem unfazed by you,\nor even treat you like\nthey're giving you directions\nto the nearest jello shop,\nthen it's likely they're\nnot crushing on you\nas much as you're crushing on them.\nYou'll have to eat your jello alone.\nAre jello shops even a thing?\nOh well.\nSo, do you think your crush\nis interested in you or nah?\nLet us know in the comment\nsection down below.\nIf you enjoyed the video,\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with your\nfriend or loved one.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go and hit\nthe notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAs always, thanks for watching."
