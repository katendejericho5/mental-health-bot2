around did you ever\nstop to listen to your inner voice\nperhaps it's been wanting to say\nsomething to you as well it is often the\ncase that we're getting on with our\nlives without recognizing that we need\nto take a step back number one\ndifficulty concentrating no no did you\nforget to do that thing you meant to do\nit's normal to forget things once in a\nwhile it's also normal for your minds to\nimagine and wander elsewhere however if\nthis happens a lot more than usual then\nit could be a sign of a deeper problem\naccording to specialist Dr Hil when you\nhave too much on your plate your mind\ntends to go into overdrive when this\nhappens you won't be able to focus and\nhave difficulty solving problems as you\nmay find it harder to look at the bigger\npicture this might pose problems in the\nlong run making it harder for you to\nhandle anything at all number two\nimpulsive decisions are you rushing\nthrough your tasks just to get them done\nit's harder for you to think of the\nconsequences of your actions when you\nhave too much to handle a 2011 study by\nthe proceedings of the National Academy\nof Sciences showed that prolonged work\nhours with little to no breaks in\nbetween get you to make quick of the\nsituation and more open to the easier\noption when you don't take breaks you\ntend to go for the most convenient\ndecisions so you make rash decisions\nwithout thinking of its possible more\nserious\ncomplications number three Perpetual\nexhaustion why do you still feel drained\nand out of energy even after good long\nhours of sleep you

stress your\nendocrine system overproduces hormones\nrelated to stress such as the adrenal\nhormones or cortisol these hormones are\nessential in dealing with stress by\nputting the body in a fight ORF flight\nresponse prolonged presence of these\nhormones in your system can affect your\nsleep and eating habits more\nspecifically they make it difficult for\nyou to sleep and shift your eating\nhabits this is the reason why some binge\neat or eat less when they're under too\nmuch stress developing these new habits\ncould lead to further health problems\nnumber five\nnegative emotions have you noticed a\ncertain pattern in your mood lately do\nyour emotions seem to be all over the\nplace as of late Studies by Gordon and\nMendes have shown that high levels of\nstress cause an increased display of\nnegative emotions such as irritability\nand anger a person who has too much to\nhandle May display a change in mood over\ntime all that pressure and stress takes\na toll on you

to deal\nwith them your relationships might even\nbegin to suffer which might lead you to\nisolate even more and number seven\ndetached self does it feel like you\nmight be losing a sense of you

what's\nhappening with you you don't enjoy the\nthings you usually enjoy and sometimes\nyou might feel detached from the\nenvironment and even from yourself the\nfastpac life limits your time giving you\nlittle to no space to reflect on\nyourself it's common practice to do your\nbest you hustle on because you're\nexpected to move forward but sometimes\nmoving forward can be too much if it's\nconstantly at break neck speed it's\nimportant to recognize your need to take\na step back it's not quitting it's not\ngiving up rather it's giving yourself\nthe time to process reflect and heal
