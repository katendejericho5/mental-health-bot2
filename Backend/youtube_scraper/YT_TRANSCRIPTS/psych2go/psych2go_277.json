    "transcript": "if you click this video then you've\nprobably been struggling to decide\nwhether or not you should be single when\nyour heart wants one thing and your\nbrain wants another you might be\nwondering how to know which one to\nlisten to and how to look inside\nyourself to figure out what it is you\nreally want being single can be tough\nbut sometimes we may choose to be single\njust to avoid the pain of rejection and\nabandonment that's why it's important\nthat we're sure we're doing the right\nthing for the right reasons before we\nhurt someone be it ourselves or our\npotential partners with that being said\nhere are six telltale signs that even\nthough you might think you want to be\nsingle your heart doesn't conflicting\nemotions according to psychologist Dr\nBella deolo if you have conflicting\nemotions about anything then it's\nprobably because you're afraid to be\nhonest with yourself about what it is\nyou really want and you're trying to\nrationalize your way out of it in this\nsituation you may find yourself torn\nbetween the desire to be single and the\ndesire for emotional attachment in your\nheart you may be craving love and\naffection but your mind keeps coming up\nwith reasons why you're better off alone\nfor now for example relationships are\ntoo complicated my last relationship\nended badly Etc craving Independence so\nyou think being single is a better\nchoice for you because it allows you\nmore freedom and Independence well\ndespite whatever you may have told\nyourself you can in a relationship and\nstill have your Independence in fact\npsychologists even consider it a\nHallmark of a healthy and loving\nrelationship according to psychologist\nDr Roxy zarabi a heightened need for\nIndependence May manifest as a tendency\nto fixate on potential Partners flaws or\nclaim that something is missing but this\nis actually just a Mal adaptive coping\nmechanism meant to keep people at an\nemotional distance emotional exhaustion\nanother reason you may be struggling\nwith being single is if you view\nrelationships as more emotionally\ndraining than fulfilling says therapist\nDr Suzanne lakman maybe it comes from\npast experience or observing the failed\nrelationships of those around you for\nexample if your parents were divorced or\nyou have a friend who can't let go of a\ntoxic ex whatever it may be it's wrong\nto overgeneralize these experiences it's\nperfectly fine to need time to recharge\nin between relationships and just focus\non ourselves for a change in fact it's a\ngood thing what's not a good thing\nhowever is if we're using this to\ndisguise the emotional baggage we have\nabout relationships and keep us from\nworking through them lack of personal\nfulfillment similar to our last point\nyou may have convinced yourself that you\nshould be single because your past\nrelationships haven't brought you any\npersonal fulfillment but the truth is\nthis may have more to do with you than\nyour relationships because according to\nrelationship coach Brad Brown morning\nyou can be in a loving flourishing\nromantic relationship and still be\ndiscontented you may mistakenly believe\nthat personal growth is something you\ncan only attain on your own but having\nsomeone who loves and supports you can\nmake a world of difference because they\ncan inspire you to be a better version\nof yourself desire for exploration last\nbut certainly not the least you may want\nto be single because you want to focus\nmore on having new experiences meeting\nnew people and broadening your horizons\nyou may be wondering if being in a\nrelationship is going to hinder your\nability to explore more and fully\nEmbrace any new opportunities that's a\nfair point and you're not wrong for\nthinking that but while it's good to be\nhonest about what we want and consider\nit with potential Partners about how\nmuch we can realistically commit to our\nrelationships know that these two aren't\nmutually exclusive according to\ntherapist Dr lakman sometimes we may\nconvince ourselves that we need a\ndrastic change change in our lives when\nwe're feeling lost or unbalanced that's\nwhy some people move to a new city quit\ntheir jobs or end their long-term\nrelationships but until we get to the\nheart of why we're really unhappy these\nwill just be temporary solutions to a\nmuch deeper problem do you feel like\nyou're out of touch with yourself or\nlosing your sense of identity do you\nlack Direction and purpose in your life\nremember it is essential to communicate\nopenly and honestly with both yourself\nand your potential Partners about your\nfeelings and desires so what are your\nthoughts on this video what are some\nways you might be struggling with\nwhether or not you should be single and\nwhat do you think may be the reasons\nbehind it let us know in the comments\ndown below psyo and if you like this\nvideo and want to learn more about\nsimilar topics we also have a video on\nfive ways trauma is keeping you single"
