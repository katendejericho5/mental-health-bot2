    "transcript": "charismatic magnetic effortless there's\njust something about them they may not\nlook like Thor but somehow the gods have\nblessed them with the gift of sex appeal\nthey seem to just naturally have it that\nIndescribable presence personality or\nattitude that excites and attracts\nothers easily here are five common signs\nof strong sex appeal do you show any\nsigns one how you kiss according to sex\ntherapist Dr Laura Burman 66% of women\nsay they would break up with a guy after\na bad first kiss she's referring to a\nkissing research study from Susan M\nHughes of alright College in the study\n59% of males and 66% of females admitted\nthat if a first kiss wasn't very\nsatisfactory at all they would end the\nrelationship it might be a good way to\nassess someone's sex appeal right Dr\nbman explains that you really learn a\nlot from a kiss she says you're seeing\nif you like the way they smell all your\nsenses are engaged and you get a sense\nof their sensuality their connection\nwhether they're a take charge kind of\nperson or more of a stepping back kind\nwow yeah you may find someone has a\nstrong sex appeal from how they kiss you\nbut it seems there's more you can sense\nas well which brings us to the next\npoint two Dynamic attractiveness you\ndon't have to look like a god or goddess\nto have strong sex appeal sometimes it\ncould be your tone of voice how you\nphrase things or how you express\nyourself this is called Dynamic\nattractiveness Dr Donald E Rio PhD\nexplains in an article for psychology\ntoday that it's all about body language\nit involves the expression of our\nemotions and our underlying personality\nand is a critical element of an\nindividual's personal Charisma so what\ncan you do to increase your Dynamic\nattractiveness Rio adds that expressing\npositive effect which can be a smiling\nface an upbeat Tempo an expressive eyes\nand facial expressions are all\nassociated with Dynamic attractiveness\nthree to wear red or not to wear red\nhave you ever heard of the red dress\neffect it's a phenomenon in which a\nwoman wearing red clothing perhaps a\ndress is seen as more sexually appealing\nas opposed to other colors but it might\nnot just be the women in red that have\nsex appeal according to findings\nreported in the Journal of experimental\npsychology the studies researcher Andrew\nElliot PhD says our findings suggest\nthat the link between red and sex also\napplies to men 25 men and 32 women were\nasked how attractive and pleasant a man\nwas in a black and white photo of them\nwith the image either surrounded by a\nwhite or red mat the American\nPsychological Association which\npublished the study stated that woman\nwho looked at a man surrounded by red or\nwhite rated the man surrounded by Red a\nlittle over 1 Point higher on a 9-point\nscale of attractiveness a statistically\nsignificant bump so the question is are\nyou going to wear the red or blue shirt\non your next date number four the pitch\nof your voice American psychologist Dr\nGordon Gallop asked 10 men to rate 10\nfemale voices based on attractiveness in\nan experiment several audio clips were\nof the same women but at different times\nduring their menstrual cycles why during\novulation females produce more estrogen\nand more estrogen can raise the pitch of\ntheir voices so what did they find men\nwere found to prefer the higher pitched\naudio clips from women Dr Gordon Gallup\nexplains that when females are midcycle\nwhen they're the most fertile and the\nmost likely to conceive their voices are\nrated as being significantly more\nattractive and number five situations\nand context matter if you love horror\nmovies or haunted houses we've got good\nnews for you here's why according to Dr\nRonald iio a great deal of research in\nsocial psychology tells us that the\nsituation matters what does he mean\nexactly well for example if you knew\nsomeone liked you you may just find them\nin your thoughts more often because of\nthis new information and thus you may\nstart viewing them in a new light Rio\nexplains that we tend to reciprocate\naffection enjoying rewarding and\npleasing experiences together makes a\npartner appear more attractive to us Rio\nalso refers to the misattribution of\narousal where one mistakes physiological\nresponses brought on by something else\nsuch as fear as attraction perhaps\nyou're watching a horror movie with your\ndate and feel a kick of adrenaline at a\nscary scene but you may just\nmisattribute this is feelings of arousal\nfor your date sitting next to you\nsituations matter maybe you don't have\nmore sex appeal at a haunted house on a\nrickety Old Bridge do you relate to\nthese signs is there someone you find\nattractive
