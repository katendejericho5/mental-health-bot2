between your character and\nhow much you enjoy sex is personality\nlinked to being kinky are some people\nmore like to cheat than others let's\ndive into the ways that the Big Five\npersonality traits can impact your\nsexual desires and behaviors keep\nwatching to find out but I can't relax\nand enjoy it according to the American\nPsychological Association if you're\noften stressed constantly overthinking\nand getting worked up over the smallest\nthings it's possible that you have a\nhigh level of neuroticism according to a\n2022 research study published in the\nwestern Journal of communication people\nwith this trait May struggle with sexual\ncommunication and may feel insecure in\nthe bedroom do they think I'm sexy oh\nwow this outfit makes me look awful why\nwould they like\nme I just shouldn't even try this level\nof overthinking can lead to overreacting\nto criticism or negative feedback from\nyour partner which can cause tension in\nthe relationship but it doesn't stop\nthere those with neurotic personality\ntrait may also feel neglected or\nrejected by their partner leading to\ninsecurities and death about the\nrelationship even when no rejection is\npresent according to a 2022 study\npublished in Journal of population\neconomics these feelings of rejection\nmay even drive them to seek comfort with\nsomeone else in simpler terms they might\nbe more prone to cheating on their\npartner due to ideas they've created\nthrough overthinking not what their\npartner has shown this doesn't mean you\nor your partner are sure to cheat traits\nand behaviors can be worked on and\nimproved upon with self-reflection and\ncommunication with your partner the\ncompromiser agreeableness defined by\nAPPA means being cooperative and\nunselfish basically if you have this\ntrait you're nice to be around as a\nfriend or a sexual partner the same\nstudy that investigated cheating and\nneuroticism suggests that being an\nagreeable person can make you prioritize\nyour partner's desires over your own\njust think back to friends with benefits\nwith milakunis and Justin Timberlake\nwhile getting to know each other's\nsexual style Mila's character Jamie\nfinds out the just character Dylan wears\nsocks during sex a bit odd right at\nfirst she laughs at it but she wants him\nto be comfortable and gets cool with it\nwhat about you and your partner are they\nmore comfortable with the lights off you\ngot it they want to try out something\nmore exciting you're all up for it the\nonly downside that the study found is\nthat by being agreeable and likely to\ncompromise you may sometimes sacrifice\nyour own needs which could potentially\nlead to lower sexual satisfaction to\navoid this don't be afraid to speak up\nand express your desires you deserve to\nhave some fun too remember we want to\ncompromise not people please routine\nShootin like what we said in the\nprevious point there are some\npersonality traits that make you open to\ndoing something for your partner out of\nlove then there are other traits that\nmake you a bit more of a daredevil being\nopen to new experiences can really come\nin handy in the bedroom in general this\ntrade is what makes you open-minded\nadventurous curious and creative in the\nsexual sphere it can mean you're a\nlittle kinky too because of your\nexpansive view of the world and a\ngreater tolerance for diversity you may\nbe more accepting of different types of\nsexual expression or exploring new\nfantasies with your partner in 2013 a\nstudy published in the Journal of sexual\nmedicine compared BDSM practitioners to\na control group and found that those who\npracticed BDSM scored higher in openness\nto experience than the control control\ngroup according to licensed sex\ntherapist Dr Michael Aaron this makes\nsense as openness to experience is often\nassociated with a willingness to\nexperiment with unconventional behaviors\nhe believes that people who are drawn to\nAlternative sexuality communities tend\nto be open-minded exploratory and\nadventurous all traits that are captured\nby openness to\nexperience Spotlight please extroverts\nare easy to pick out in real life\nthey're the Social Butterflies or the\npeople who are are happy on a stage a\nstudy which was part of the\ninternational sexuality description\nproject LED in 2008 found that\nextroverts don't fear expressing their\nsexuality and often like to engage in\nsexual behaviors in that study more than\n13,000 participants from 46 Nations\nresponded to self-report measures of\npersonality and sexuality after\nreviewing the responses they found that\npeople who scored high in extraversion\nwere more likely to be interested in\ncasual hookups and one night stands on\ntop of that they were more open to the\nidea of dating multiple people at the\nsame time without feeling the need to be\nmonogamous again just because you're\nextroverted it doesn't mean you're not\nmonogamous but if you're feeling bold\nand adventurous Between the Sheets it\nmight just be your extroverted nature\nshining through hard work pays off as\nAPPA defines it conscientiousness is all\nabout being organized reliable and\nresponsible if you're high in\nconscientiousness you might be the type\nof person who always has a plan and\nfollows through on your commitments if\nyou're a conscientious lover your sexual\nsatisfaction might be off the charts a\n2018 study published in the Journal of\nsex research took a closer look at the\nBig Five personality traits and tested\nhow they relate to sexual functioning in\ncouples conscientiousness was the only\ntrait that had a significant effect on\nboth men and women's sexual function men\nhigh in conscientiousness reported fewer\nissues with erectile dysfunction while\nwomen women high in conscientiousness\nexperience fewer problems with desire\narousal orgasm and even less pain during\nsex researchers believe that\nconscientious Partners May respond to\nsexual problems with an integrating\nconflict resolution strategy this means\nthat instead of using an unhealthy\ncoping or communication strategy like\ngiving the silent treatment projecting\nor running away from the problem they\nshow concern for their relationship and\ntalk it out which helps their sexual\nrelationships your personalities Drive\nhow act in every aspect of your life\neven your sex life do you have any of\nthese personality traits or maybe you\nsee some of these traits and behaviors\nin your current and ex partners are\nthere other personality traits we should\ncover let us know in the comments below\nand please remember these findings are\njust the tip of the iceberg personality\nand sexuality are both deep and complex\nand their relationship doesn't have to\nbe definite after all for a good and\nsatisfying sex life it's not so much\nabout personality tests it's about what\nworks for you and your partner thanks\nfor watching and we'll see
