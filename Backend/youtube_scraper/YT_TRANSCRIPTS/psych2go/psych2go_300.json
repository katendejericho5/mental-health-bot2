    "transcript": "hello Psy too viewers Welcome to our\nfirst ever holiday hangout I'm so\nexcited this is the perfect opportunity\nfor anyone who is holiday fatigued tired\nof all the stress I'm here with the\namazing Dr Ran um you know she is a\nlicensed psychologist she has her own\npractice in Beverly Hills can you tell\nus a little bit about yourself Dr Ran\nwe're so excited to have you here yeah\nit's my pleasure to be here um excited\nto be with you all um I'm a clinical\npsychologist and a relationship coach I\nalso do life coaching and I've been\nworking with clients now for almost 25\nyears so it's been a long time and I\nloved what I love what I do I get to\nhelp people understand themselves a\nlittle bit better in terms of how we\nwork emotionally and mentally and I get\nto help people feel better and heal and\nlive their best lives so I'm all about\nit and I know that Christmas is a tough\nholidays can be tough so\nI'm happy to be here thank you so much\nand like how are you feeling during this\nholiday season has it been a lot has it\nbeen stressful or has it been just like\na little more chill calm I've actually\nhad a lot going on um there's just been\na lot of family stuff happening and a\nlot of you know I think for me it's also\njust schedules change like a lot because\neverybody's going out of town and you\nknow everybody's kind of you know\nneeding needing new session times or\nmore session times because people start\nto feel kind of blue or you know kind of\nfeel anxious about the holidays so it's\nalways a little hectic for me but I love\nthis time of year me too and I was gonna\nsay so this we're approaching Christmas\nwe're approaching well Christmas Eve are\nChristmas Eve and Christmas kind of like\ntwo separate holidays would you say\nbecause like people celebrate on both\ndays yeah I think it depends I've\nnoticed that sometimes like culturally\nit's a little different like some people\nwill open gifts on on Christmas Eve and\nsometimes people Christmas day is a big\ndeal so yeah I think um it depends\nthough and then there are some people\nwho you is celebrating Hanukkah this\ntime Year too yeah and I that's I was\ngoing to say Hanukkah and then there's\nNew Year's and there's so many other\nholidays and so it can be really strong\nthese are like the big ones right\nexactly there's usually a lot of\npressure around you know people that we\nhaven't seen for a while um maybe how we\nlook to relatives who haven't seen us\nfor a while so maybe it's like oh my\ngosh so and so is going to make a\ncomment about my weight or so and so is\ngoing to say this or that um and also\njust you know I think you know wanting\nthe dinners and and everything to go\nwell and um and sometimes I even you\nknow a lot of times clients get\nreflective about at this time of year\nand they think about you know what have\nI done this year have I really achieved\nwhat I wanted to achieve this year um\nyou know so there's that kind of anxiety\ntoo because people start to reflect you\nknow no I I I definitely think that\npeople will reflect and I think that\nsometimes it brings out the best in\npeople and sometimes it brings out the\nworst because they don't see the\nspiritual aspect of it they see more of\nlike the vain sort of superficial aspect\nof it like I have to have the best gifts\nand the best outfit and that and this\nand that it's just ridiculous right and\nI want yeah go ahead oh no I see already\nsomebody's April saying she hates this\ntime of year sorry April I was going to\nbring that up April why do you hate this\ntime of year I mean I get it but I want\nyou to like talk to us because this is\nour hangout why do you hate this time of\nyear let us know in the comments um who\nelse hates this time of year I don't\nhate it I don't hate it but it can be\ndifficult it can be like I want alone\ntime but it almost feels like you're\nforced to spend time with people and\nsometimes when anytime you're forced to\ndo anything I don't know I I think it's\nkind of upsetting what I always tell\npeople and this is something I encourage\nall my my clients to do is I I I\nencourage people to to make the holidays\nyours and I do that through you can do\nthat through ritual you can do that\nthrough little things like for example\num I love doing a little gratitude tree\nyou know like for Thanksgiving so like\npeople like you all the Christmas stuff\nis out at that at Thanksgiving time or\nyou don't even really need even a tree\nif you hang like you can get like coat\nhangers or or something make a little\nmobile and start you know make little\nlittle um tags that you can hook on\nthere for things that you're grateful\nfor so that you're\ncelebrating Thanksgiving or Christmas or\nNew Year's in in a way that's meaningful\nfor you and you know so maybe doing\nsomething special for yourself before\nyou see your family so that you can\nreally kind of take in the time of year\nand and ask yourself okay what does this\ntime mean for me what what is it that\nI'd like to to think about reflect on\nyou know yeah definitely I agree with\nthat gratitude and I was going to say\nhen you love Christmas why can you tell\nus in the comments like what's the what\ndo you love the most about Christmas and\nthen Ariel also said yes I feel the\npressure let me see she said I feel\npressure to be happy and festive when I\nfeel like I need a l time yes I think\nthat's the biggest problem like life\ngoes on it's not just like the holidays\nfor most people but we have to almost\nlike pret like oh where's the Christmas\nspirit and that can be a lot of pressure\nto people I feel my mom if I'm in a bad\nmood she'll say that to me like where's\nyour where's your spirit I'm like I\ndon't have any you know what be be\nauthentic you know no matter who says\nwhat remember that you have more power\nthan you think you do you only don't you\nonly feel powerless when you give it\naway so sometimes we put so much\nattention and focus on what other people\nare saying or on what expectations might\nbe if you take a breath and take a step\nback and go wait a minute I'm going to\nbe me right now and how do I feel you\nknow what do I need right right yeah I\nwanted to bring this up thank you James\nfor bringing it up he said it's\nstressful for me because I work retail\nJames I used to work retail you guys are\namazing um it's so difficult this time\nof year for people in the customer\nservice industry because I know that\nsometimes they might get treated poorly\nor they have to work the holidays and we\nappreciate you so much and you deserve\nthose holiday bonuses if you get them\nyou deserve them you should get them and\nyeah we need to acknowledge that more\nbecause I know people who think oh\npeople in the service industry they\nshould work on Christmas that's\nridiculous no no I I agree James I'm so\nsorry it's a bummer when you have to\nwork on a holiday but you guys are\namazing and if you you know it it's it's\nnot easy to to be under pressure when\neverybody else is kind of on vacation or\nyou feel like you should have time off\nbut take little breaks for yourself and\nyou know do try to build in time for\nyourself so that you don't feel like oh\nmy gosh here's the holiday and it's all\nabout everybody else you know so care is\nimportant during this time and then Gail\nmentioned I'm wondering what you guys\nare celebrating spending money you don't\nhave so people will like you Dr Ran\nwhat's your take on that how do you feel\nabout the\nconsumerism aspect of christas because\nit is a lot of spending yeah I don't\nlike the consumerism piece I I think and\nthis is why I I really like I like\nritual I like the idea of ritual because\nit's Christmas is not about how\nexpensive a gift you know who had who\ngot the most expensive gift or who's\nbuying the most expensive gift Christmas\nto me in any holiday where you have an\nopportunity to spend time with people is\nabout sharing your heart and about\nreally kind of being able to appreciate\ntime with others and um to me you know I\nthink the more personal sentimental\nthings are cards and and I mean people\nwho bake and spend time spend quality\ntime giving of themselves right\ndefinitely it's too bad I feel like it's\nsuch a weirdly stressful time in stores\nlike you just barely are have enjoyed\nHalloween and all of a sudden they have\nall the Thanksgiving you know\ndecorations up and then all of a sudden\nit's Christmas and all of that so yeah\nthank you yeah I agree and then so I\nwanted to start with like questions Dr\nRan if you're okay with that I wanted to\nstart the hangout with some questions um\nso princess Emil asked and I this is a\ngreat question because for a lot of\npeople like I mentioned earlier there's\na lot of pressure on the holidays she\nasked Dr Ran my question is what advice\ndo you have for panic attacks and before\neveryone before you answer that what is\neveryone drinking tell me in the\ncomments I'm drinking coffee with\nvanilla cream what are you drinking dran\nwater water okay healthy a healthy Queen\nWe love it well I talk all day long so\nyou know Gotta Have Some Water um you\nknow that's a great question about panic\npanic attacks um when all the anxiety\nbuilds up and builds up we start start\nto spin and we can start to feel it in\nour bodies so we'll start to get the\nsweaty palms and maybe the the tightness\nin the chest and difficulty breathing um\nwhat's really really powerful two things\nI I can I can share with your viewers um\none is to have to to be able to do a\ngrounding exercise and grounding\nexercises are super easy they take you a\nfew seconds and you can start to feel\nbetter um when you have a panic attack\nessentially your mind body are split\nyour body is holding so much and your\nmind hasn't processed it's it's spinning\nright so then your body carries the\nOverflow and all of a sudden you start\nto feel all of your anxiety and panic in\nyour body so what do we need to do we\nneed to ground we need to pull us pull\nourselves out of our heads and connect\nwith our bodies so a grounding exercise\nthat I like that's very easy that you\ncan even do in a room full of people is\nyou know when you when you when you you\nlook around the room tell yourself okay\nI'm going to count blue things and start\ncounting blue things or I'm going to\ncount round things start counting round\nthings why does that help it helps\nbecause you're engaging your senses in\nan activity and you're\nrefocusing so you're giving a pathway\nfor your senses to connect in a\ndifferent way which means that you're\nengaging with your body if you're\nengaging in that way you can't be a same\nlevel of panic your your respiration\nwill slow down you'll start to calm and\nthings will start to shift that's one\nthing you can do is a grounding exercise\nanother thing you can do is deep\nbreathing and visualization a good one\nthat I like is a 313 breathing cycle\nwhere you inhale for a count of three\nyou hold for a count of one and you\nexhale for a count of three while you do\nthis you visualize you know let's say\nthat your anxiety what color would you\ngive give your anxiety what texture\nwould it be maybe my anxiety looks like\nyellow little fists that are inside that\nare in my chest or that are in my\nshoulders or in my neck when I inhale\nI'm going to inhale white light or blue\nlight something that's very calming and\nhealing and I'm going to imagine that\nlight breaking up all of those yellow\nfists so they break them apart break\nthem apart when I hold my breath I'm\ngoing to imagine that all of that broken\nup yellow stuff is turning into black\nsmoke and I'm breathing it out when I\nwhen I exhale for three immediately if\nyou do two or three breathing Cycles\nlike that you you will start to calm\ndown and you'll notice that you'll start\nto have some tightness release and\nthings will start to get better but\nwhenever we join mind and body we are\nthat much more powerful in bringing\nbalance back emotionally and\nmentally amazing I agree with that I\nlove what you said about visualizing it\nlike how does it look right now I'm not\nsuper stressed I feel like it looks like\na peachy pink that's how I feel inside\nbut sometimes I love that I love that so\nCJ Studios asked at dran why do I feel\nso hurt and sad all the time I feel like\neveryone looks down on me and I'm only a\nkid CJ I just want to say I always felt\nlike that as a teenager and I did not\nlike the holidays as a teenager I always\nfelt like it was a chore and that people\nwere judging me or that I had to act a\ncertain way and I felt overlooked so I\ntotally feel you on that it can be hard\nfor teenagers but go ahead Dr Ran yeah\nI'm so sorry um CJ that you feel that\nway you know often times when we are not\ngiven space to be ourselves we can start\nto feel sad I mean anxiety is one\nresponse sadness is another where we we\ncan start to feel sad we can start to\nfeel invisible like nobody really sees\nus for who we are and I think that again\nwhen you start feeling that way I think\nit's important for us to be able to\naffirm for ourselves tell ourselves\nwhat's really true is that really really\ntrue because usually what we do is we\nget into a space we we get into just our\nhowever we feel and the feeling gets\nbigger and bigger and bigger we don't\never question it we don't ever give\nourselves a little bit of of space to\nthink about it but CJ I'd be willing to\nbet that you're really special and that\nyou are important to your family you are\nimportant to any gathering this holiday\nand I I hope you can remind yourself of\nthat and I'm sorry that you felt\noverlooked and unimportant but you're\nimportant to us and we're happy that you\nshowed up today yes all of our viewers\nare important to us and we're going to\num this is going to be a thing that we\ndo like very often because we want you\nknow our viewers to feel loved and feel\nheard and this is a space to feel heard\nand to have a voice and to meet new\npeople like you guys can totally Talk\nAmongst yourselves as well and so\nanother question I have here is by it's\nnot a question it's just a comment but I\nreally love it by Maria she said I lost\nmy mother a month ago but I keep\ncelebrating Christmas because she loved\nit and I do too it's my way to honor her\nand Dr Jean you talked about this during\nour last stream that like when it comes\nto loved ones who passed away sometimes\nthe holidays can be a great opportunity\nto honor them and so Maria that's\namazing that's beautiful Maria I love\nthat and I'm so so sorry for your loss\nthat's such a fresh loss and and I hope\nthat you're you have the support that\nyou need I hope that you have the you\ntake the time that you need for yourself\nyou know if you need time and some space\nbut I think it's beautiful that you're\nhonoring your mother's uh wishes in a\nway you know you're remembering who she\nwas and and I am sure that where where\nwe where our hearts are um our passed on\nloved ones come are with us you know\nwhere we where we put our hearts and our\nenergy I believe that those who have\npassed on see that and know that and are\nwith us so that's\nbeautiful then Dr Jean this is a really\nsweet question rain asked Dr Jean how do\nyou celebrate Christ how did you\ncelebrate Christmas when you were\nyounger it's up on the screen that's so\nsweet for you to ask yeah that is sweet\nyou know it's funny I I my family is\nfrom South India so I was the first like\nkid in my family that was born in this\ncountry oh wow too oh wow you're first\ngeneration also cool well um so our our\ntradition we don't obviously we don't\ncelebrate Christmas but then you know\nwhen I was a kid I had to kind of like I\nhad two cultures right because my mom\ntaught me how to read write and speak TL\nwhich is our language and um we had our\ncustoms and our food and all the things\nthat we would do in our home but my\nparents also wanted they knew that I'm\nI'm an American also so they wanted to\num hold that space for for who I am as\nan American so we started to celebrate\nChristmas I think for little kids of\ncourse you see everybody else has toys I\nwant toys too even if you don't know\nwhat it means but for us I think\nChristmas has just always been about a\ntime where we get to spend time together\nas a family doing the things that we\nlove like we play cards and we'll eat\npizza and we'll watch basketball and\nwe'll you know we'll do all of the in\nmovies and all that kind of stuff and\njust and have fun as a family um and\nthen of course we've had you know trees\nsome years and we exchange gifts and\nthings like that so kind of a um\nbicultural though sometimes we don't do\nmuch and we just kind of do our thing\nyou know what what our family is used to\nbut some days we some years we feel like\nreally decorating and celebrating so\nwe'll do that yeah that's amazing and I\njust wanted to ask did your I don't know\nif you mentioned this but did your\nfamily Cook like from scratch or like\ndid you guys buy food because I I had a\ncomment on that oh yeah no we my my\nmom's a great cook and my I was lucky\nenough to have my grandparents live with\nus too for a while so I got I got to\nlearn how to cook and you know nothing\nlike homecooked South Indian food you\nknow it's right really cool so yeah and\nit helps you Bond that's that's amazing\nbecause that's something I feel like I\nwas missing in my in my childhood\nbecause um love my parents they're great\nbut they felt like the best thing they\ncould do was save up money and buy us\nfood during the holidays and I think it\nwould have been great if we would have\ncooked together or cooked at all like a\nhome-cooked meal my my mom's never been\nthe one to love cooking and that's okay\nbut I think that that's important\nhonestly to do something together can't\njust be about gifts and buying food like\nyou should do something together well\nand it's that's the quality time\nright I mean that's why I think that\nthat you know commercially it doesn't\nreally mean much I mean it got you know\nI know I know families that they just\nwrite checks to their kids and that's\nChristmas but I mean you create memories\nwhen you bake cookies or when you you\nknow when you watch a movie together or\nwhen you have a you know kind of play\ncards or whatever you create memories\nand to me that's what creates a bond and\nand that's what makes the holidays\nsomething special rather than something\nintimidating something competitive\nright yes definitely Carla I'm from\nSoCal Orange County so are you Dr ran\nright yeah I live in Anaheim I'm\nactually from Anaheim so\num well we live we live in Orange County\nbut I'm based in in um Beverly Hills and\nI'm also I've got my I'm in my home\noffice now so yeah amazing and then um I\nwas gonna put this one up let's\nsee\nso I wanted to bring up this com SPS SPC\nProductions I want to have Christmas\nspirit but I just don't I feel that I\nthink we can all feel that sometimes it\njust doesn't feel right and you know\nwhat Don't Force It that's what I would\ntell you is there is nothing you know\nthere's nothing more important than\nbeing yourself and and being more\ncomfortable being yourself if we really\nthink about what anxiety is is if we\nreally think about what depression is\nwhat is it it's it's for whatever reason\nyou're not able to tolerate being\npresent you can't it's too much you're\nstuck somewhere else right so to me you\nknow trying to not be anxious trying to\nnot be depressed you're going to create\nmore of it right because the thing is we\ncreate change when we can accept the way\nthings are you know um and I think that\nthat if you're not feeling the Spirit\nthat's okay you know you're not feeling\nit pressure yeah you're not feeling it\nand it and that means that you can do\nlittle things if you want to feel the\nChristmas spirit I think because I think\nI believe that's what that what what um\nthat comment said also do little things\nlike you know involve your senses go\nwalk in the mall maybe not the mall it's\ngoing to be too crowded but but go like\nif you you know down down a a Main\nStreet like if you live in for example\none of the things I love to do I like to\ngo to the orange circle and um they have\nsuch beautiful Christmas decorations up\nI love the smell of you know latte like\npumpkin latte or or getting into the\nsmells of Christmas the the the you know\ngoing and seeing the decorations and\nthat kind of thing if that's something\nyou really want to be more present to\nthat's what I would do because I think\nyou know and and be real about where you\nare don't try to pretend you know\nbecause you get to feel how you feel\ndefinitely I think something that can\nhelp people too is maybe looking at\nsomething that they feel like they can\ndo to help people what inspires you to\nhelp others why not do that during the\nholidays maybe buy a family who's\nstruggling some food or you know donate\nto a charity give you know toys to\nchildren who don't have any which I I\nmean I think that can really make a\ndifference is maybe not thinking so much\nabout just yourself and thinking about\nmaybe others definitely I think that can\nhelp and it could also make you um\ncreate new friendships relationships\nthrough that absolutely absolutely and\nyou know you can you can go um you can\neven like a lot I know a lot of animal\nrescues are looking for volunteers at\nthis time of year because you know there\nare a lot of you know puppies and and\nand cats that need attention you can go\nand and and play with little animals\nthat don't have a home yet um there's so\nmuch so many ways to spread love so many\nways to to spread gratitude and as you\ndo then you your heart starts to feel\nbigger you know and you start to feel\nlighter definitely um lato McGee just\nmade a comment I'm sad every day and I'm\n42 been like this all my life I was the\nthe one always getting mistreated I'm\nsorry Latoya that you know breaks my\nheart especially during this time of the\nseason do you have any advice for her Dr\nRan oh Latoya I'm so sorry to hear that\nI mean I think you know every Every Soul\non this planet is is unique and\nbeautiful and valuable and I think you\nknow Latoya if you've been feeling that\nsad every day I would recommend you know\nif you haven't been into therapy I would\nI would maybe go into therapy because it\nsounds to me like if you're carrying a\nlot of a lot of stuff from the past then\nyou might need help processing that and\nletting that go because you're young you\nhave your whole life ahead of you\nthere's so many things that you can look\nforward to but we can't really clearly\nsee what's in front of us if if we're\nstill looking through the lens of the\npast we can't do that and so we have to\nlearn how to grieve um losses we need to\nlearn how to grieve you know and move\nthrough things like abuse so that we can\nactually lighten lighten our load and\nmove forward to the things that we\nreally deserve in life you know so\nLatoya if you are interested in therapy\nI would love to talk to you um give my\ncontact information I think at the end\nit's in the description yeah okay the\ndescription the unconscious mind.com and\nthat goes for anybody who's listening\nwho feels like they could use some extra\nsupport um we'd be happy to see you in\nmy practice so before we continue the\nquestions I have an exercise for\neveryone in the comments tell us what is\none thing you'd really want for\nChristmas like if you had one wi wish\njust tell us what you'd want and we can\ntalk about it okay but anyways SBC\nProductions ask it's hard having autism\nsometimes I do things and then I realize\nit's weird and start feeling like I'm\nbeing secretly judged I love this\nbecause a lot of people who are\nneurotypical I think that during the\nholidays it's very like you have to act\na certain way and and you have to be a\ncertain way and if you don't people\naren't going to be nice about it even\nthough it's the holidays they might\njudge you or say something rude and so I\nlove this question or this comment\nbecause I think that it's interest it's\nimportant to acknowledge that\nneurotypical people might not have the\nbest um feelings going into the holiday\nsometimes in in some cases what do you\nthink about that Dr No I know and it's\nhard it's it's a tough one I mean the\nfirst thing I'll say first of all is\nthat it it you know it's I think it's\nBrave and it it it takes a lot of\ncourage to be yourself when you're when\nyou're neurod Divergent and I think that\nthat's exactly what you should do I\nthink that that we get so caught up in\nsocial cues and and social expectations\nand and all of the pressures of how we\nshould be but remember if you want to\nchange how you are then the first step\ntowards that is acceptance but it sounds\nto me like it's it you know maybe you're\nin environments where people are not so\naccepting um and if that's the case then\nyou know I think that it's probably good\nfor you to you know elect to spend time\ndoing things that make you comfortable\num if you have to be at a gathering\nperhaps that you don't want to be at is\nthere a person who you feel more\ncomfortable with who you might be able\nto sit next to and be with during that\nGathering that's one practical way to\ndeal with nervousness or deal with\nuncomfortableness\nwhen we're in group settings like that\num you know and and the thing is there\nis no normal that's the other thing I'll\nsay normals a misnomer we're all on some\nsomewhere on that Spectrum right I mean\nit's it's it's a spectrum autism\nspectrum so all of us you know have have\nour own you know quirks and\nidiosyncrasies because that's just what\nit is to be human um but I I do\nunderstand that feeling of being\nsecretly judged and you know what I will\nalso say this most people are\nself-absorbed quite honestly Y and and\nso sometimes we can feel the pain of our\nown judgment more acutely and we then\nassume that it's coming from someone\nelse that's the other thing that could\nbe true is because most people are are\nare feeling awkward most people are\nworried about saying or doing the wrong\nthing most people are really wrapped up\nin their in themselves so that's the\nother thing I'll say is that if if you\nfeel you know is that voice of Jud\njudement yours or if is it coming from\nsomeone else and and maybe that's the\nother piece to look at is you know maybe\nI can I can accept myself forgive myself\nfor being different and maybe I can give\nmyself a break and let this go\ntoo yes I agree with that for sure and\nthen um someone asked or sorry I let me\nsee this comment can you read it Dr Ran\ndo you see it uh past holiday depression\ncan we talk about past holiday\ndepression this a good or post holiday I\nthink this is thing post holiday\ndepression this is a good one yeah you\nknow I I think the holidays and and\nlongdistance relationships and anything\nwhere we don't have any kind of\ncontinuity can can have a Disneyland\neffect that's what I call\nit where everything is so incredibly\ngreat and fantastic oh my gosh presents\nand you know the holidays can be that\nway wow so and so got me all I got all\nthese gifts so I got to see so and so\nthey came over it was so much fun it was\nso great and now I have to go back to\nwork and now I have to go back to my\nlife um anytime we have a situation like\nthat I like to do what I I call a soft\nLanding which means um like for and\nbecause everybody goes through that we\nall get kind of the post Christmas blues\nor the post holidays blues and it's like\noh got to go back to work um I will the\nlast you know maybe depending on how\nmuch time you have off or whatever um\nwhether it's a few days or whether it's\ntwo weeks or whether it's three days\nwhatever um the the about a couple of\ndays or maybe three or four days before\nI have to go back to work I will do one\nwork thing and then I'll do you know\nI'll do one thing to organize or I'll do\none thing to work or I'll do one thing\nto clean or or something like that where\nI'm reintroducing my normal activity\nwith into my life again um towards the\ntail end of my holiday and then that way\nwhen when that first day of work comes\nit's kind of it's okay I've kind of\nacclimated to it a little bit better um\nthe other thing that you can do that\nthat I think is kind of you know can can\nbe kind of good is to just have have a\nlittle you know have a little ritual\nwhere you're like you know I'm so a\nlittle gratitude ritual for the holidays\nand book end it with what are you\ngrateful for about returning back to\nwork or returning back to life after the\nholidays because gratitude is something\nthat immediately picks us back up and\nimmediately puts us into a different\nflow of energy so those are two things I\nwould do and it's fun to look forward to\nlike the new holidays like you're going\ninto winter what's my cute winter look\ngonna be Valentine's Day maybe yeah like\nSt Patty's Day like there's going to be\nother things you know when the holidays\nend new things arise immediately after I\nmean it's all a social construct isn't\nit yeah absolutely and part of that too\nis the commercialism part of the that\nbig let down is that commercialism\nbecause everything is so hyped up in the\ncollective energy and then all of a\nsudden when it's gone it's like you know\nit feels like a big let down so yeah\nthat's that's the other thing to keep in\nmind is sometimes we're fine we just\nhave to realize okay you know what\neveryone's kind of going through this so\nmaybe that's why it's a little bit more\nintense get sorry go ahead I know just\nto get perspective yeah and everything\ngoes on sale like as soon as like the\nholidays end like January first\neverything's on sale so that's something\nto look\nforward all about the sales that's true\nand then princess Amil asked this\nquestion I think this one's important\nbecause a lot of people during the\nholidays feel they can't come forward\nabout this because they're you know they\njust have uh you know a way of feeling\nabout this but uh Dr Rajan she asked how\ncan I help someone who is thinking of\nself harm well you know that's such a\ndifficult uh question I mean it's such a\ndifficult thing when you have somebody\nclose to you or somebody that you care\nabout who's thinking of self harm um you\nknow I think the best thing to do would\nbe to to you know talk to them about\ngetting professional help that is going\nto be the best thing to do um there's\nalso you know um I believe it's 211 you\ncan call um it's there's there's suicide\nhotlines that that also people people\nwho have training to talk about to talk\nto people who are struggling with self\nHaring behaviors or self Haring um\nideation uh it's really important to get\nthem to to see a professional if they\ncan if they if they won't then you know\nI think the thing that also happen\nhappens with people is they start to\nfeel really stressed out and feel really\nlike a sense of over\nresponsibility and and the truth is if\nsomebody won't get help there isn't\nanything you can do about it right you\ncan be a supportive friend you can offer\nto you know what how about how about we\ncheck in how about we go out for a cup\nof coffee or how about I'll give you a\ncall at the end of the week or you know\nyou know we maybe we can text I think\nyou know having having connection with\nsomebody who's in a low place place like\nthat is important but I think hopefully\nthat connection is about you know\ngetting them to start to see that they\nthey do need professional help because\nthat's something that would need to be\nworked out in therapy\nultimately yes\ndefinitely um let's\nsee and I have another exercise for\neveryone so let's let's talk about what\nis something you're grateful for this\nholiday season and yep let's start with\nthat in the comments let us know what\nsomething you're grateful for starting\nwith Dr Ran what is something you're\ngrateful for just one thing in the\nholiday season yeah oh gosh well I'm I'm\nreally grateful for um my my my puppies\nI'm grateful for Harley and\nLola a they have two senior senior pugs\none

unfortunate but\nit would have been nice one thing I am\ngrateful for though is this opportunity\nto be creative on psych to go but\nespecially like with these live streams\nbeing able to help other

it in\nthe chat where are you from cool yeah\nthis is great um let me ask you a\nquestion Dr Ran\num's gonna ask\nsomething but let me see okay we have\nsomething from Canada we're based in\nCanada just so you know it's so cool um\np\nPennsylvania cool\nHungary yeah Colorado oh I've always\nwanted to visit Colorado Norway someone\nfrom Norway hey Norway I'm headed well I\nI hope I have time to go to nor we have\ntime to go to Norway maybe Australia\nAustralia lovely good old USA it's\nsummer it's actually summer in Australia\nright now right I yes Belgium turkey\nyeah Finland finland's in the house all\nright\nyeah oh listening from Italy\nwonderful\nwow amazing like International uh\naudience here we have a beautiful\naudience I feel like I've always said\nthat like I I've um watched a lot of\nYouTube and I see like different fan\nbases but the psych to go fan base just\ngetting to know them they're so\nintelligent and empathetic and sweet and\nsupportive I mean people in the com\nwe'll post a video and someone in the\ncomments might say I'm having a hard day\nand everyone will rush to that person in\nthe comments to try to uplift them like\nthe community here atso is so beautiful\nand it's a community of almost 12\nmillion we're almost at 12 million guys\nand we're gonna have like a big event\nwhen it happens so that's amazing wow\nexcited for that very cool and\nthen so speaking I don't want to get\ninto a the negative territory but I I\nguess we have to talk about it um\nsomeone asks I'm dealing with a toxic\nmother-in-law this year should I just\navoid her what do you think Dr it's you\nknow it's tough because again with I\nthink I think with certain relatives\nthat are difficult that can be pain that\ncan say hurtful things I'm guessing\nthere's probably some\nsome uh not so nice comments maybe that\nare made or maybe there's some tensions\nor maybe some um expectations that feel\nlike a lot of pressure to perform or do\nthings in a certain way you know I I\nbelieve that with you know with with\nrelatives that are like\nthat you need to you need to first of\nall ground yourself right if you're\ngoing to be in a space where you're\ngoing to see this person then you have\nto kind of take some time to affirm for\nyourself you know what someone say's\ngoing to be there this is how she always\nis but let me let me remind myself of\nwhat's true true I'm a nice person I'm\nthis I'm that affirm those things about\nyourself that this person tends to you\nknow maybe set off kilter for you and\ntends to maybe hurt you in those ways\nfrontload yourself affirm those things\nfor yourself and then have have C you\nknow like I think boundaries are so\nimportant and sometimes we can have\nboundaries based in some basic things\nthat we decide I'm gonna I'm gonna say\nthis when I know that she's GNA make\nsome sort of comment about what I'm\nwearing or whatever I'm going to say you\nknow what I feel really good in this\noutfit I I actually really like it you\nknow people people feel like there's\nthis you know when someone says\nsomething mean or negative or whatever\nwe sort of shrink we can kind of shrink\nand then all of a sudden we start to\nfeel insecure or start to feel like oh\nmaybe there's something wrong with me\nbut what if what if we treat it like oh\nthat's just another comment that\nsomebody's making but actually how do I\nfeel about it I kind of like it I think\nI I feel pretty pretty good actually you\nknow um being able to respond from a\npositive place where you're you're the\none who's on your side and pretty soon\npeople let go people will not make those\nkinds of comments anymore um if you can\navoid people who are are mean or or you\nknow maybe not nice then that that's\ncertainly something you can do is is to\nmaybe say oh you know what I'm I'm\nactually not kind of a little tired I'm\ngoing to take a nap or I'm going to\nexcuse myself to go here or there just\nto make make sure that you have the\nspace that you need too you know um\ndefinitely that's very important like\nyou have to feel comfortable before you\ncan get like I feel like for it to be\nfun and healthy you have to feel\ncomfortable first for any EV yeah but if\nyou can remind yourself of oh yeah this\nis so and so I mean I know I'm going to\nsee see her this is how she is and I'm\nnot going to take it personally if you\ncan affirm those things for yourself\nbefore you go it's almost like you're\nyou're kind of putting your armor on so\nyour you're not going to react as much\nwhen when they do say whatever they say\nor make you feel uncomfortable or\nwhatever definitely Chad travnik um I\njust wanted to address this um and I\nthink this is a really good one he asked\nI'm not trying to be rude but if you can\nprovide captions for all of us I\nactually just message um someone who\ncould help with that and hopefully for\nthe next one we can add captions and\nsubtitles because we we really need to\nbe accommodating so thank you for\nbringing that up Chad great that'll be\nreally\ngood and then\nso let's uh an so an animator asked Dr\nRajan how can I deal with having six\ndiagnosed mental illnesses on a daily\nbasis I'm still in school and I'm a\ncontent creator wow okay a lot well\nthat's a lot I mean that that's\ncertainly a lot of diagnosis um I'm\nassuming then that you are in therapy\nand I guess my questions would be are\nyou in therapy um do you your diagnoses\nrequire\nmedication um and you know because those\nare two really important things if we\nhave gotten to a place where we've we've\nseen a mental health professional we\nknow that we've been diagnosed are you\nknow they're saying that yes we have a\ncertain diagnosis then we need to be\nable to treat the issue at the level of\nbrain chemistry so some diagnoses don't\nrequire medication um I think some might\nsome diagnoses there's a lot we can\nreally do with um mindfulness-based\ntherapies to help with anxiety and\ndepression for example um and also\nemotionally focused tapping and things\nlike that but if it is a more serious\ndiagnosis then it would it really is\nimportant to make sure that you're\nyou're with a therapist regularly if if\nyou're if you have medication you need\nto consistently take the\nmedication and um be working with a\npsychiatrist as well um and when you do\nthings like that consistency and doing\nthings the right way are really\nimportant like um going to therapy once\na month isn't probably isn't going to\nhelp but if you're going regularly every\nweek then you're going to start to feel\nbetter you're going to start to have\nthat support similarly with medication\npeople are like oh yeah medication I\ndon't like when it makes me feel this\nway or that way if you're on a\nmedication especially a psych you know\npsychiatric medication it's important\nyou have to follow as directed you have\nto use as directed and make sure that if\nyou're going to make any changes at all\ncomes from your psychiatrist and you're\ndoing it under the care of your\npsychiatrist so those are the things I\nwould say right off the bat and then\nmaking sure that you have time for\nself-care getting proper rest if you're\nit sounds like you're super busy too\nwith what you were saying being a\ncontent creator being in school making\nsure that you have proper nutrition and\nrest is also really\nimportant yes um thank you for that Dr\nJohn Jackson I'm not ignoring you uh yes\nask whatever you want please this is a\nspace you can ask literally anything but\nI wanted to uh just uh put this comment\nout princess Emil want she's thanking\nyou Dr Ran she said just wanted to say\nthanks for being able to talk about\nmental health P too's videos have truly\nhelped me understand mental health and\nmake and they make me feel like I'm not\nalone thank you princess it's my\npleasure princess Sam it's it's lovely\nto have you here it's my pleasure to be\nhere and you know I think all of us have\nissues all of us do I mean me included\nyou know nobody's alone in this nobody\nshould feel alone in this because as I\nsaid earlier in the program there is no\nreal normal there is no such thing as\nnormal we're all\nvariations you know of a kind and we all\nhave issues to deal with so yeah we need\nto help each other and we need to talk\nabout it so that we don't feel the\nstigma right yes definitely and then\nJackson asked this is his question or\nhis or her question how can I talk to\npeople about my mental health I hate\nmyself and I'm suicidal and I feel like\nI can't talk to anyone with do I do I'm\nsorry Jackson and you are not worthless\nyou are worth it and you shouldn't hate\nyourself but here we are to you know\nhelp Dr Ran um what can you how can you\nspeak to this oh Jackson I'm so so sorry\nit sounds like you are really in in\nhurting and you're in some pain um you\nknow um if you feel suicidal then I\nthink as I said earlier it's so\nimportant to get in touch with a\nprofessional and um um it's so important\nJackson to I think you probably would\nbenefit from therapy you'd benefit from\nhaving a regular relationship with the\ntherapist that you can trust because it\nsounds to me like you you probably have\nbeen through some trauma in life it\nsounds to me like maybe you have had to\ndeal with a lot lot of negativity\nperhaps and this has Le left you feeling\nvery distorted about yourself and and I\nwill say that you are absolutely\nvaluable you are so special and valuable\nand important and my hope is that you\nwould be able to um do these things for\nyourself so that you can start to build\nup your self-esteem and Confidence from\nthe inside out and and a and a therapist\ncan help you do that um my contact\ninformation is in the Box in in you know\nin the bottom there in the box so if\nthere's anything I can do to help you or\nhelp anyone else who's struggling please\ndon't don't um hesitate to reach out you\nknow and if even if I can't see you then\nI I have I have a a therapist working\nfor me who's taking clients and we are\nalways you know if we can't see you\nimmediately then we will make sure we\nget you into um you know get you the\nreferrals that you need so in in\nwhatever way we can to uh help we're\nhere to help yeah guys and then I have\nmy email here if you guys wanted to um\nsend Dr Ran an email um I'll also put it\nin the description or if you guys had\nany questions about the live streams or\nany any recommendations I'm going to put\nmy email in the chat so and it's also in\nthe\ndescription and let me see if there's\nmore question well there's always more\nquestions but let's this is a really\ngood one um Sam asked how to focus on\nworking and later relaxing I have that\none problem where I can't focus on\nsomething so I relax but then I\nprocrastinate and I end up stressing um\nout in the middle of the night about my\nfuture oh my God that's so\nme I'm working and later relaxing ah\nokay so you need boundaries for yourself\nthen is what it sounds like to me um you\nknow being able to have internal\nboundaries and sometimes I find that you\nknow um when we're dealing with work\nlife balance um that that there are some\nsome EX exercises that can be extremely\nhelpful um particularly uh cognitive\nbehavioral exercises I think can be\nhelpful to Institute those internal and\nexternal boundaries so for example one\nof the things that I I say to my uh\nclients that are really really driven\nand they kind of are bordering that line\nof being Workaholics is you need to\nreally create a boundary around okay\nwhat when is my work time right within\nthat boundary of work time um let's say\nthat it's an eight hour work day within\nthat eight hour work day how many breaks\ndo I get right what are what are my what\nare my little breaks in between like do\nI get maybe a five or 10 minute break\nhourly do I get a lunch break do I get a\nbit of a longer break instituting those\nbreaks is important because you your\nbrain needs to have a break we can get\nreally amped on anxiety and feel really\nstressed out and think think that we\nhave to work work work all the time but\nif we don't get enough rest and if we\ndon't have breaks then your brain is not\ngoing to function as efficiently as it\nwould otherwise right by the same token\nif we keep pushing things off and\npushing things off and pushing things\noff not getting anything done then all\nof a sudden you'll have a mountain in\nfront of you and then you're you're not\ngoing to feel like you can do anything\nright so I think that you know one trick\nthat I do is if I really feel like I\ndon't want to do anything I will I will\nsay okay I have I'm going to do one\nthing in the next 15 minutes so let's\nsay that I have like a ton of emails to\nget through that I have to answer you\nknow to you know write back to people if\nI have 50 emails to get back to to write\npeople back then I will say okay I'm\ngoing to do five emails this hour you\nknow I'm going to do other things too\nI'm going to take breaks but I'm going\nto come back and I'm going to do another\nemail now I'm going to do a little bit\nyou know or even if it's if you students\nout there who have chapters and chapters\nto read or papers to write it might\nsound a little silly but small goals\nreally help to build momentum so I'm\ngoing to do I'm going to read this\nchapter for 10 minutes and then I'm\ngoing to take a break I'm gonna do I'm\ngoing to write a paragraph or write a\npage and then I'm going to take a break\nbecause it's still more work than you\nwere doing before and this way you're\nalso allowing your brain to get into\nsome kind of Rhythm and you're allowing\nyourself to you know take bites you know\ntake manageable bites out of this big\nsay that you have to work through now\nright yes definitely and then Zen forel\nask I never reached out to others about\nthis but do you guys have any tips for\nhow to deal with hypers sensitivity\nTenny criticism and SE severe fear of\ndisappointing others and rejection I\nwould say first is that you probably\nhave to process some traumas or issues\nthat you have un that that are\nunresolved that would be my take but go\nahead Dr Jean yeah usually when we have\nsomething really really when we're super\nsensitive about something or when we\nabsolutely have no ability to tolerate\nsomething usually that is tied to some\nkind of history that that usually means\nthat there is something that has\nhappened historically in our lives or in\nour relationships that have made us\nbelieve a certain way or that have\ncreated fear or anxiety around having\ncertain kinds of discussions or or\nhaving a certain kind of information\nright given to us um so certainly those\nare things that can be worked out in\ntherapy um I think that with with hypens\nsensitivity to criticism I guess my\nquestions would be you know around who\nare you spending your time with you know\nwhat what what is the nature of this\nkind of\ncriticism and also you know what what is\nit because usually when we're really\nreally super sensitive to something that\nsomeone says there's a belief that we're\nholding on to that is is triggered right\nso let's say that I feel I'm overweight\num and it's something that I'm really\nself conscious about if somebody says\nsomething to me like oh um that's that's\na lot of food are you going to be able\nto eat all that food or something like\nthat immediately I'll think oh they\nthink I'm fat right yeah but but what is\nthat really I mean is it is it EXA is\nthat exactly what they think may not be\nat all it might not be at all but it\nattaches to a belief that we already\nhave and that's why it creates that\nimmediate reaction of like oh my gosh\nthat hurt my feelings or oh my gosh\nthat's mean or\nright so so I think that it's going to\nbe important to consider again frontload\nyourself who am I going to be hanging\nout with is this a critical person do\nthey say these kinds of things then what\nare my boundaries around that you know\nyou can you can be firm and kind you\nknow so you know what I I really don't\nwant to talk about that or I'd prefer\nnot to say or you know that's perfectly\nfine to do as well but I think that\ncertainly it's going to be the way that\nwe get more resilient and strong in\ndealing with criticism is to be able to\nlearn how to introspect and look within\nourselves and work on those things that\nare important for us because if we're\ndoing that work then comments really\naren't going to matter as much they're\nnot going to they're we're not going to\nbe as tender or as\nsensitive yes I agree and I wanted to\nask your um email just to be sure it's\nat the conscious it's let me see it's I\nput it in the the group chat CU people\nare asking for it they can't I'll see\nthe description but it's Dr Ran at the\nconscious life and then dash dash the\nconscious Dash okay is it is it this Dr\nranthe conscious life-life do.com no\nit's Dr rajin atthe conscious daslife\ndocomond Das okay yeah I I I put it\nthere correctly I just said it wrong\ndran atth conscious dlife docomo it's d\nr r a j an atthe conscious and then a\ndash and then life.com yes and then\nthat'll be in the description too and we\nwill be um dran will be on either later\nagain this month or definitely for um\neither January for a post holiday stream\nand Valentine's Day hopefully for\nsomething Valentine's Day themed so you\nguys will be seeing her again um but I\nwill put all of her information on uh in\nthe description and we have it in the\nchat as well and so then let's see the\nnext question um we have one by Willow\nshe\nasked I have a friend who always\ncriticizes me now so now every time I\nsee that friend I worry if I can trust\nthem and I worry too much about\ndisappointing them what should I do I\nwould cut ties\nbut what's your take I'm probably not\nthe best one to answer you know Willow\nit's what I'm gonna say is probably\ngoing to be uncomfortable but I I think\nit's honestly the best way to deal with\nthese kinds of situations is to have an\nopen discussion to have a conversation\nabout it um if you know if this is a\nfriend who you care about if this is a\nfriend who cares about you then then\nthis is a person who would want to know\nif they're coming off a certain way and\nyou have every right to tell people um\nwhat you know give people your feedback\nand tell them hey you know what you're\nhurting my feelings or hey do you are\nyou aware and maybe and a good way to\nbring that up is hey you know can we\ntalk are you aware that when you say\nthis this and this it feels critical to\nme do you mean to criticize me and and\nopen up a discussion about it because if\nthat person doesn't know they're\nbehaving that way then that's going to\nbe valuable information for them so that\nthey can maybe you know think about how\nthey behave and what they say and maybe\nmake some changes it'll also help you\nfeel better because you're going to be\nadvocating for yourself and you're going\nto be making it clear hey you know what\nthis doesn't feel very good i' I'd\nappreciate being treated better um you\nknow and and about disappointing them\nand trusting them I mean I wonder you\nknow like um Michelle said she would cut\nties is this person a valuable person to\nyou because we have lots of different\nkinds of friends for different you know\nseasons and different reasons in our\nlives if this is a person you really\ncare about if this is a person who's\nimportant to you then I would definitely\nhave a conversation about it and be\nhonest about how you feel um if this is\na person who's not maybe that important\nto you maybe more of an acquaintance\nthen yeah I don't I don't see I wouldn't\nI I probably wouldn't spend that much\ntime around this person because it\nsounds like they they don't have a very\nnice energy if this is how they deal\nwith their friends but so those are\nkinds of kind of decisions that you have\nto think about or you have things that\nyou have to think about so you can make\nthe right decision for you but yeah\nthat's definitely some friends aren't\nworth keeping that's the truth because\nthey're not good for your mental health\nand they're not\nunderstanding and so I have one more\nquestion that we're going to answer\nsince for dran tips on how to flow with\nlife when things aren't working out\nfinancially and career-wise this is a\nreally good one I think people stress\nout a lot about the string the holidays\nbecause you got to have that money to\nbuy all these things and it's a lot of\npressure so it is it's hard you know I\nthink that one thing is don't let\nyour values or your feelings you know be\ndetermined by other people's\nexpectations or other people's choices\nright because we can get into a real\ncompetitive situation really easily when\nit comes to who gave the better gift or\nwho bought the most expensive gift or\nall of that kind of thing um we can get\ninto comparing ourselves to other people\nwhen we look at oh so and so's driving\nthis car or so and so is doing this for\nthe holidays or they're they're able to\ntake this long vacation but I can't\nafford to take a vacation like that so I\nthink you know being clear on what are\nthe things that you are grateful for in\nyour life what are the things that you\nare grateful for and working on in your\ncareer um and what are what are the\naspirations that you have that that um\nyou're you're moving towards you may not\nhave arrived yet you may not have the\nincome that you want yet you may not\nhave gotten to that position in your\ncareer that you're working towards but\nit's important to\nnurture um who you are and the path that\nyou're on uh because you know we're\nwe're living in an ego-based society\nthat is so ego-driven and and they want\nthey want to know what the end results\nare how much money do you make what kind\nof job do you have what kind of car do\nyou drive but you know what process is\neverything life is process life is\nJourney so reminding yourself you know\nwhat I'm a good person these are the\nthings I'm grateful for this is what I'm\nworking towards in my life and I know\nthat I'll get there right so that when\nyou encourage yourself that way when you\nremind yourself of what's important to\nyou then it's easier to have some\nDetachment when there those other things\nthose people say make comments or say\nother things or when you start to see\nthings that you maybe make you feel like\nyou know you're not good enough or you\ndon't have enough or or that kind of\nthing and you know the other thing I\nwould say too is um have special\nexperiences with people money is not\nalways what you need to have a cool\nChristmas gift it would be cool to hey\nyou know what I'm going to take you out\nand we're just going to have an\nadventure today or we're going to we're\ngoing to go get some good coffee you're\ngoing to get get have a lunch and I want\nto take a long walk with you I want to\nhear about how you've been doing um you\nknow quality time and and and also being\ncreative maybe maybe you're an artist\nand maybe you're creative you can do\ncreative things to as gifts and you know\ngiving those to other people too so\nthank you so much for that and
