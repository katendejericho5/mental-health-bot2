every human being yearns for the\nsame thing to experience affection and\nan intimate connection with another\nperson when we are infants the mere fact\nthat our caregivers attend to our needs\nwhen we cry soothed us unconsciously\nbut why is it that when faced with a\nloving partner you may sometimes feel\ncompelled to build walls yes a certain\namount of apprehension is definitely\nnormal but when you are afraid of\nfalling in love to the point that it\nbecomes overwhelming you may be\nexperiencing philophobia psychiatrist Dr\nNara explained that philophobia is\ndefined as an excessive fear of falling\nin love which is detrimental to Mental\nHealth and Social relationships\npsychologist Dr Romina tavina in a\njournal article titled why are we afraid\nto love said that you might feel fear of\nfalling in love to a varying extent\nbased on your attachment patterns and\ndefense mechanisms you developed as a\nresult of early trauma a depressed and\nanxious mother may be unable to help you\ndeal with strong emotions and feelings\ncausing you to feel insecure and\ndependent or perhaps you have an\nemotionally distant relationship with\nyour father causing you to feel\nemotionally Tethered to your family or\norigin as a result your childhood\nattachments serve as a template for how\nyou believe relationships should be for\nthe rest of your life therefore problems\nin these early relationships may cause\nyou to put your guard up in your current\nrelationships with that said how can you\nidentify if you're afraid of falling in\nlove actions intentions picture this\nyou've met a special person and you know\nyou've met your true love as you fall\ndeeply in love with this person you find\nyourself always criticizing him for his\nsmall Behavior\neven when he doesn't deserve it it's as\nif you are subconsciously trying to\ncreate a wedge between both of you and\ndrive them away as clinical psychologist\nDr Firestone points out your attachment\nhistory heavily influences the way you\ncreate distance in a relationship for\nexample someone who is dismissive\navoidant may not want to get too close\nto others and resent others relying on\nthem when their significant other voices\ndissatisfaction about wanting more from\nthem they feel their partner is too\nneedy causing them to withdraw even\nfurther someone with a fearful avoidant\nattachment pattern has the tendency to\npull away when things get too close but\nthe opposite can also occur when they\nsense that their partner is pulling away\nso do you remember any moments when your\nactions were not aligned with what you\nfelt overly critical are you too focused\non your partner's flaws do you fall into\nthe pitfall of overanalyzing their\nactions and intentions you may hear your\ninner voice say he he never put up an\neffort to celebrate your anniversary he\ndoesn't really care about you although\nyour significant other does 90% of the\ntask you're fixated on the 10% that is\nincomplete according to therapist David\nBrasher this negative internal monologue\nis the result of your self-critical\ninner voice the more critical you are of\nyourself the more critical you will be\nof others and even more so to those\ndearest to you this inner critic is a\nterrible life coach who is geared to\ngenerate distance if you find this video\nrelatable and helpful please give the\nvideo a thumbs

hard to engage in that\nconversation Dr Firestone explained that\nthis is known as emotional Detachment\nyou'll remain detached if you are afraid\nof getting too close to the person youd\nlove it's natural for you to feel\nnervous when you're embarking on a new\nrelationship the act of falling in love\ninvolves taking a real risk however if\nyou're afraid of getting too close to\nsomeone you'll be hesitant to accept the\nrisk which causes you to feel vulnerable\nand unsafe therefore you tend to keep\nthem at arms length for as long as\npossible second guessing have you ever\nexperienced immense excitement when\nyou're on a date with someone but the\nvery next day a voice chimes in he's\njust being nice he's not that into you\nsuddenly that excitement shifts into\ndoubts and fears according to Dr\nFirestone this second guessing can\nactually be a sign that you're afraid of\nfalling in love the moment your love is\nwithin your reach you start to question\nit this can manifest by trying to pick a\nfight or pushing your partner away\nbecause being close to someone activates\nyour fear of loss and the agony of not\nhaving felt that love during your early\nyears\nsecretive do you become passive\naggressive in a romantic relationship\ninstead of verbalizing your true\nfeelings for example when your partner\ndoes something that makes you\nuncomfortable you find it hard to\nexplain how you feel licensed marriage\nand family therapist Allison Gomez\nexplains in a mindbody green article\nthat someone who is afraid of closeness\nin a relationship experiences difficulty\nadvocating for what they really want\nfurthermore you prefer to keep certain\nthings to yourself to maintain low\nexpectations because of this you might\nbe in a relationship with someone for a\nlong time but feel like strangers in\ncertain ways because the relationship\nremains on surface level relationships\nthat end can certainly burn our hearts\nwith intense pain and falling in love\ninvolves taking that risk nevertheless\nisn't it better to have loved and lost\nthan never to have loved at all love is\none of the most rewarding experiences of\nBeing Human and being close to it robs\nyou of having meaningful\nrelationships love requires sacrifice\nbut it can also be one of the most\nfulfilling and selfless challenges you\nwill ever face can you relate to any of\nthese signs I can let us know in the\ncomments below and remember you matter"
