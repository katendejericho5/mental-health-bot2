Loop the first step to\nrecognizing a problematic habit is\nasking yourself how did I form this\nHabit in the first place according to\npsychology today habits are formed form\nMed by three elements triggers behaviors\nand rewards triggers are the things that\nprompt you to engage in your habit\nbehaviors are the Habit itself and\nrewards are how the Habit makes you feel\nbetter this process is called The Habit\nLoop let's say you have a bad habit of\nshopping online a little too often\nsometimes to the point of buying more\nthan what you can afford after some\nreflection you may come to realize that\nyou only go on spending spree when\nyou're bored and a alone this is because\nwhen you buy new things you feel excited\nand get a temporary sense of fulfillment\nthat relieves your loneliness in this\ncase feeling lonely and bored is the\ntrigger online shopping is the behavior\nand the emotional relief and excitement\nis the reward if you're stuck in a\nnegative Loop of triggers behaviors and\nrewards this may be a sign that your bad\nhabit is becoming a problem the good\nnews is once you identify each element\nin your habit Loop you can break out of\nit and stop your bad habits\naccording to Healthline one way to do\nthis is to write down the cues or\ntriggers that make you want to engage in\nthe habit what triggers your bad habits\nonce you know what your cues are you can\ntake steps to change things in your\nenvironment and make the habits less\ntempting for example imagine that you\nhave a habit of staying up too late in\nthis case you can pay attention to the\ntriggers that keep you up you notice\nthat you tend to call your friends\nbefore bed and talk to them for longer\nthan you should to eliminate this\ntrigger you could turn your phone

hand positive\nhabits are often formed consciously and\nthrough continued effort think about the\nhabits you're intentional about in your\nown life if you have a habit of\nexercising for example you probably\nstarted doing it intentionally because\nyou knew it was good for your health\nthrough repetition you made it a part of\nyour routine and it's now a beneficial\nhabit but if you have a bad habit like\nprocrastinating it's probably something\nyou started doing\nunintentionally do you have a behavior\nthat's unintentional that you tend to do\nmore when you're stressed if so you\ncould benefit from monitoring this\nBehavior to avoid it becoming a problem\naccording to psych Central another way\nto break problematic I habits is to\nrecognize the reward it gives you an\nimportant Concept in behavioral\npsychology is when actions are rewarded\nthey are reinforced causing us to do it\nmore but when they are punished we are\nless likely to continue the behavior how\ndoes your bad habit reward you once you\nknow what your reward is you can find\nhealthier ways to get it nature versus\nnurture are your habits similar to your\nparents in an interview with bustle\npsychiatrist Dr Brian Bruno said that\nbad habits are often learned from our\nparents when we see our caregivers deal\nwith things growing up we learn these\nbehaviors ourselves as a result we\nimitate bad habits that temporarily\nrelieve stress or pain but are not\neffective in the long run Dr Bruno also\npoints out that bad habits can actually\nbe passed down genetically overall your\nhabits are a result of both nature and\nnurture if you have a habit that one or\nboth of your parents have that affects\nthem negatively then this could be a\nsign that you're following in their\nfootsteps and then it may become a\nproblem now that you've realized it\nearly what can you do to prevent this\nfrom worsening Dr Tristan Michael\nWilliams from the Berkeley well-being\nInstitute recommends replacing your bad\nhabit with a more positive one stopping\na bad habit without replacing it with\nsomething else isn't effective and is\nlikely to result in a relapse but\nstopping the habit and then replacing it\nwith something better can help you break\nit for good for instance when you feel\nthe urge to engage in your bad habit\nleave your environment and go for a walk\nto de-stress and recharge continue to do\nthis in replace of your habit and over\ntime you'll replace your old Behavior\nwith a healthier one if you reached the\nend of this video and realized you have\na few problematic habits or
