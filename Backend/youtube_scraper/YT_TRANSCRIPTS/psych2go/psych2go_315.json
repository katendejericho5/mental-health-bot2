psychology\naccessible to everyone now let's begin\nshall we\ngood child syndrome is when a child\nfeels pressure to always be well behaved\nand obedient in order to please their\nparents or other authority figures even\nif it means suppressing their own\nfeelings and desires sound familiar from\na young age we seek validation and being\nlabeled the good child can fulfill that\ndesire but the pressure to maintain that\nfacade of goodness can lead to good\nchild syndrome where you feel the need\nto be perceived as good despite the\nnegative impact on your mental health\nhere are three signs you may suffer from\ngood child syndrome\ndid I do good\nimagine you're back to being six years\nold you're in the kitchen and want one\nof the freshly baked cookies from the\ncounter instead of Simply taking it you\nask one of your parents can I have a\ncookie please\nyour parents seems pleased with your\nrequest and replies yes you can have one\nafter you finish your homework and bring\nit to me desperate for that decadent and\nfreshly baked sweet you rush to finish\nup your last bits of homework run to\nyour parents and ask did I do good as\nyou anxiously await a response your\nparents says try again most of this is\nwrong why can't you be good in school\nlike your brother safe to say you didn't\nget your cookie and something inside\ncracks because it's only natural to seek\nexternal validation from a young age\napproval from parents Guardians and\nteachers can be crucial for a healthy\nupbringing but relying on it can be\ndevastating in adulthood\ngood child for instance could grow up\nreliant on the approval of others and\nfail to develop their own thoughts and\nideas Desiring external validation is\nnot necessarily bad it can be assuring\naffirming and positive but when it\nbecomes the focus of your actions that\nmay be a sign you lack self-validation\naccording to licensed psychotherapist\nSherry Gaba learning to recognize when\nyou are seeking validation from external\nsources is the first step\nby acknowledging this Behavior people\ncan choose a more effective option\nbreaking the cycle and learning to look\ninternally for validation so before you\nask someone did I do good think about\nwhy you want their validation and remind\nyourself that you should not need to\nrely upon others approval\nif you find this video relatable

and\nlearn early on that bad behaviors\noutbursts and emotions only earn their\nparents disapproval psychologist Gordon\nneufelt calls this Dynamic of\ncodependency the cookie cutter referring\nto when the child cuts themselves into a\nshape that allows the parent to only see\nthe acceptable side and all negative or\nbig emotions like anger upset jealousy\nand disappoint are left outside of the\ncookie they learn that they must change\nfor the sake of others and work hard for\nlove and affection when in reality they\ndon't\nin reality you don't have to work hard\nto be loved because love
