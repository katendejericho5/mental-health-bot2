    "transcript": "if you've ever been in love or got lost\nin a daydream of romance you may have\ngotten the idea in your head that those\nintense feelings of true love will last\nforever but real love is more than just\nthe initial feelings of butterflies the\nstrong attraction and the intense\nfeelings that come with romantic love\nmay fade in and out during a long-term\nrelationship relationship specialist and\npsychologist Mark e sharp PhD explains\nthat after those beginning feelings fade\nmost couples are left with feelings of\nconnection and affection even so most\ncouples have to work to keep their\nrelationship lasting even those who\nexperience real love that lasts the test\nof time have to work at it so how do you\nfind a love like this where do you even\nbegin that love to give but to who love\ncan take a lot of work even if it's for\nyourself relationship expert Margaret\nPaul PhD States in a mindbody green\npodcast and article that there is a big\ndifference between trying to get love\nand actually sharing love we can't share\nlove if we don't have love to share so\ndoes this mean you can't love anyone if\nyou don't love yourself no but loving\nyourself sure does seem to make things\neasier in relationships insecurities and\nharsh judgments about yourself can hurt\na relationship you may commonly look to\nonly your partner to soothe these\nself-doubts and assure yourself and\nwhile most people love Assurance from\ntheir partner it could be unhealthy to\nrely on only them for those harsh\ninsecurities To Be Tamed relationship\nexpert Margaret Paul puts it into\nperspective by asking that people\nimagine their inner selves as a child\nshe explains you would not be going\naround the neighborhood trying to find\nsomebody else to take care of your child\nright you take care of that child\nyourself perhaps figuring out the next\nsteps as you go along\napply that logic to yourself what would\nhappen if you asked someone else to care\nfor your inner self the love of your\nlife may gladly help care for your inner\nchild but feelings of rejection and\nabandonment may come into play from you\nin regards to yourself even if your\npartner loves your inner child that kid\nis still going to look up to you feeling\na bit neglected Paul says that when you\ndon't love yourself that's what happens\non the inner level beware of these red\nflags\nif you want to find a love that's\nhealthy and lasts then you should be\naware of these common relationship red\nflags for starters a good relationship\nshouldn't revolve around needing to feel\nneeded falling into emotional dependency\nearly in the dating process with your\npartner can often be a bad idea people\noften want to feel needed and can go\ninto relationships mainly looking for\nthis type of\nsatisfaction psychiatrist Abigail brener\nMD explains in psychology ol ology today\nthat the need may be that you my partner\nmust do certain things for me to make me\nfeel secure and satisfied or that you\nallow me your partner to feel needed by\nfulfilling your needs but she warns that\nthis will often lead to a relationship\nwith little or nowhere to grow on a\nfirst day it's also a good idea to look\nout for the big red flag of someone\nnegatively ranting about their ex\npsychotherapist k Gillis explains in\nPsychology today that it shows an\nenormous lack of respect towards others\nin their life and ultimately speaks to\ntheir integrity there is an appropriate\nway and time to discuss concerns and\nissues with previous Partners so watch\nhow this is done then there's some other\nclassic red flags lying jealousy\negocentrism controlling manners the list\ngoes on but perhaps one red flag that\npeople sometimes try to convince\nthemselves out of is simply feeling UNC\ncomfortable around them what yes it's\nsometimes obvious that we as humans\nwould turn away from what makes us\nuncomfortable but psychologically\nthere's more at play here\npsychotherapist Katie Gillis explains\nthat trauma survivors specifically those\nwith a family origin of trauma have\nlearned a coping mechanism to ignore or\neven deny their reality she goes on\nexplaining that poor treatment is often\nnormalized in their adult relationships\ndue to them being taught as children\nthat those who are supposed to provide\nlove and comfort often end up hurting\nthem a healthy loving relationship\nshouldn't be filled with ill treatment\nGillis recommends to pay attention to\nthe amount of time you spend trying to\ndecipher untruths or Lies when you catch\nyourself saying that just does not make\nany sense trust that feeling if you're\noften feeling uncomfortable but find\nyourself automatically dismissing it\nthat is an important red flag that you\nshouldn't ignore the green flag that may\nlead to love Okay so we've talked about\nred flags but what about green flags\ncommon green flags in a relationship can\nbe consistent kindness trustworthiness\ncommunication reliability and\nprioritizing each other but there is one\ngreen flag you can look out for to see\nif you found a partner that could truly\nlove you or already does a 2006 study\npublished in the Journal of Personality\nand Social Psychology found that how\nyour partner reacts to your good news\nrather than just bad news can reveal a\nlot about your relationship 79 couples\nwere videotaped discussing good news and\nbad news to their partner researchers\nobserved the partner's behavior and\nresponse to hearing the good news and\nbad news the person giving the news\nrated how understood validated and cared\nfor they felt during the reveal of news\nafter 2 months the researchers checked\nin on those couples again and found that\nresponses to positive event discussions\nwere more closely related to\nrelationship well-being and breakup than\nwere responses to negative event\ndiscussions the results are discussed in\nterms of the recurrent but often\noverlooked role that positive emotional\nexchanges play in building relationship\nresources so if you want a clue into how\nyour relationship is going reveal some\ngood news to your partner do they\npassively approve or show genuine\nexcitement Mutual Delight or are they a\nbit detached in response to your joy if\nyou're mutually sharing the happiness\nthis good news brings then that seems\nlike a pretty green\nflag making your love\nlast so perhaps you're thinking all is\ngoing pretty well love seems to be in\nthe air but how do you make it last well\nthere are few things that may help for\none a strong Foundation is vital in an\narticle for psych Central licensed\nmarriage and family therapist mudita\nrastogi PhD explains that your interests\nopinions and experiences can change as\nyou grow but if you share the same core\nbelief systems you will have a platform\nfrom which to build a strong\nrelationship core beliefs and values can\nbe very important in a long-term healthy\nrelationship but what about the little\nthings when one first starts dating\nperhaps indeed looking for love they may\nget too hung up on sharing similar\ninterests the small ones but this\ndoesn't always lead to a successful\nrelationship similar interests and\nhobbies aren't as important as you may\nthink initially licensed associate\nmarriage and family therapist Sheila\nTucker\nlft explains to bust that we're often\nled to believe that we need to be\ncompatible in every area of our lives in\norder for a relationship to work however\nrelationships often work best when you\nhave the ability to do both things apart\nas well as together so while core values\nand beliefs seem to foster a loving and\nhealthy long-term relationship varying\nhobbies and interests can as well you\nmay just both take an interest in each\nother's interests as long as you get to\nknow each other and if not sometime\ndoing your own thing is healthy too as\nlong as you both spend quality time\ntogether during other moments but what\nabout conflict you may ask well clinical\npsychologist Yana dubinsky psyd has\nfound in her research that conflict is\nbound to happen with all couples at some\ntime the key here is how they handle and\nmanage their conflict hm so instead of\nfocusing on winning the fight listening\nto understand what your partner is\ntrying to express seems more vital don't\nyou think dubinsky continued to explain\nin an article from Psy cental that we\ndon't have to agree but we must work to\nunderstand so once you found love it's\nbest to not only enjoy it but to truly\ntry to understand the source of it all\nas well who is it you love and what is\nit they're trying to say you love them\nafter all so take a listen love is a\nmagical thing and if you're searching\nfor it we want to hear what it is you're\nlooking out for give us the good news\ncomment down below what it is you're\nlooking for in a loving partner you\ncan't always rely on signs to find Love\nsometimes things simply don't work out\nbut rather use those signs and\nrelationship Flags to find a partner\nthat could just one day be your love\nhopefully one that lasts that test of\ntime if you both put in that commitment\nand work often every long-term\nrelationship needs we hope you've\nenjoyed this video if you did
