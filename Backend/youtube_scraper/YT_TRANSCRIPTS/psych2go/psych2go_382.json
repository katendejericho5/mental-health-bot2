    "transcript": "[Music]\nhello psych too viewers this is Michelle\nRivas and I'm the host of psychology\nRoundtable we have two amazing guests\ntoday for our expert panel the first is\nlicensed clinical social worker\nchildhood trauma specialist and the host\nof his own amazing YouTube channel\nPatrick Tian the next is psychiatrist\nand host and founder of the popular\nYouTube channel healthy gamer Dr K\nwelcome to both of you thank you so much\nfor being here\nthank you so much for having us I think\nit's an honor to be here absolutely it's\nan honor to have you yes and so um can\nyou both tell us a little bit about\nyourselves and your expertise let's\nstart with Dr K sure so um I'm uh Dr K\nso I'm I'm a psychiatrist by training um\nstruggled a lot with technology\naddiction growing up failed out of\ncollege um went to India to find myself\ndecided to become a monk but then met my\nwife fell in love in the opposite order\nactually um so decided to go to medical\nschool and then part of what I\nreally loved about medicine was the mind\num that was my favorite organ so ended\nup training to become a psychiatrist and\nreally incorporating a lot of like\nEastern principles of the mind and\nmental health uh and then a couple years\nago started focusing on technology\naddiction by streaming on Twitch and\ntalking to Gamers about the impact of\ntechnology on their brains and on their\npsychology and so that's where healthy\ngamer was born amazing amazing and then\nPatrick um I I I started off really as a\nas a client you know in my 20s I started\nto do I um I really hit the the jackpot\nand started to do some trauma work with\na really gifted therapist and then there\nwas some sobriety in there and so it\nwent like Dr K's story went from a lot\nof mess to doing a lot of work and then\nto kind of finding finding yourself and\nkind of finding a passion and talking\nabout this stuff and finding a bit of a\npurpose in it as well and yeah and then\nwith with YouTube I was just putting up\none video as a project I didn't go into\nit I don't know if this was your\nexperience too Dr K like I was just\nputting up a video just to kind of see\nwhat sticks and then it didn't do much\nfor a year and then all of a sudden it\ngot shared somewhere and then here we\nare several years later\nso yeah okay perfect that's amazing\nthank you guys for that and so Dr k i\nfirst wanted to touch on the science\nbehind ADHD first for our viewers what\nexactly is ADHD and how is someone\nclinically diagnosed with it and what is\nthe genetic\ncomponent okay that's loaded\nquestion so let's start by defining a\ncouple of terms so ADHD is attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder so the\nfirst thing to understand is that the\nattention deficit part is pretty uniform\nbut not everyone is hyperactive so ADHD\nis a neurodevelopmental disorder which\nmeans that for some reason the way that\nour brain develops is a little bit\ndifferent and it's characterized by a\ncouple of different things so the first\nis disordered attention and disordered\nattention can mean either having\nattention that's too distractable or too\nfocused so the key thing about ADHD is\nthat when we should be shifting away we\nhave trouble shifting away so I'm on my\nphone and I really need to get to work\nand I really can't get to work and I'm\nstuck on there or when I should be\nfocusing I'm getting distracted so I'm\nsitting in class I'm trying to pay\nattention and it's hard for me to focus\nso that's a disorder of attention and\nthere are other subtypes other aspects\nof it so it can also have things like\nimpulsivity um it can also have\nemotional disregulation so people with\nADHD experience emotions more hotly and\nmore intensely and so there are a lot of\ndifferent features to it and one of the\nkey things that we need to diagnose a\ndisorder is that it should impair\nfunction in some way so it causes some\nkind of problem in your\nlife and when we say sort of ADHD is\ndiagnosed clinically we've got two basic\nways we diagnose it one is through\ntaking like a history so we'll ask\npeople you know what did you struggle in\nschool you know how did that go like\nwhat's your attention like how what's\nare your emotions kind of like do have\nimpulsive behavior what's your emotional\nregulation like so we'll we'll take kind\nof a clinical history and usually what\nwe're looking for is the presence of\nsymptoms starting pretty early um uh\nusually in childhood and Patrick may be\nable to speak a little bit more on that\num but also that it's present in\nmultiple situations so it's present at\nhome and in school that's a big part of\nthe the clinical diagnosis and the cool\nthing now is that we have a lot of like\nneuros pychological testing so there's\nactually like tests you can run to sort\nof see if someone has ADHD and then I\nthink the last question that you had was\nabout genetics and the genetic component\nabsolutely and ADHD does have a genetic\ncomponent because it's something about\nthe way that your brain develops which\nis in some way determined by your\ngenes but I think that the you know the\ntricky thing about the genetic component\nis not everyone who has a parent with\nADHD is doomed or destined to have ADHD\nor vice versa um and that the other\nthing that we're sort of learning more\nand more and I think this is really\nPatrick's area of expertise is that even\nif you have a a parent with ADHD it's\nnot just the genes that will sort of\ninfluence your ADHD it is the\nadaptations that your parent has learned\nthe things that they don't know how to\ndo because they're not neurotypical that\nthey can't teach you how to do so\nthere's absolutely a nurture component\nas well as as well as a genetic\ncomponent\nabsolutely and that's the perfect segue\nto this studies show that adults\ndiagnosed with ADHD are more likely than\nthose without ADHD to also have\npost-traumatic stress disorder or PTSD\nthat's a mood disorder that might\ndevelop after a traumatic event people\nwith PTSD can have ongoing trauma\nsymptoms or ones that come and go\nPatrick what is the connection between\ntrauma and\nADHD\num there's so much overlap it's it's\nhard to sometimes differenti between the\ntwo but when I really think about the\nthe factors that kind of bind them two\ntogether um lack of focus um I I have\nthis theory that a lot of it is sort of\ndissociative and I don't mean like a\nHollywood version of dissociation of\nreally being way outside of your body\nseeing yourself in in some kind of like\nmovie just really not being grounded not\nbeing focused\nnot not kind of being able to think and\nfeel and communicate at the same time so\njust really kind of or in other words\nwhen I think about dissociation how I\nexplain it it's just simply maybe being\nin our head being freaked out of what\nthe Barista might be thinking about us\neven though that we didn't do anything\nwrong as a version of being anxious and\na little bit dissociative just a little\nbit so I see a lot of that in between\nthe two um sort of low frustration\ntolerance uh um uh\ndisorganization like that's what I mean\nabout the overlap that in many ways it's\nhard to tell the difference between the\ntwo what in a way if it's just organic\nADHD on its own it may not have a lot of\ndeep-seated trauma beliefs there can be\nlow self-esteem beliefs like oh I can't\ndo anything or I can't get anything\nright but in terms of like childhood\ntrauma based attachment beliefs that no\none likes me or I mess everything up I\nmean even those are hard to us out so I\nthink what I'm trying to say is\nwhere I find that in terms of figuring\nout is it trauma is it ADHD is it both\nthey kind of really go hand inand with\neach other it really comes down to what\nin what happened to that individual\ngrowing up in that house at that\ntime so that's kind of how I see the the\nconnection it's even there's just it's\nalmost talk about it's\nyour it's easier to figure out their Sim\ntheir similarities it's harder to figure\nout their differences oh wow that's an\ninteresting way of putting it and would\nyou say people with like ADHD are more\nprone to depression anxiety like does it\nalmost exists comorbidly is it like a\npackage deal\nalmost yeah that's tricky in a way\nbecause if I think about if we think\nabout a fourth grader in public school\nwith just organic\nADHD he's potentially being he or they\nor she are being potentially traumatized\nby the social interactions around them\ndepending on how sensitive the\nenvironment is to what their needs are\nso I think like what Dr K mentioned\nsomething earlier about sort of like the\nthe social component and then what's\ngoing on on at home with the ADHD in\ncontext of childhood trauma I don't know\nif that I don't know if that makes sense\nbut do you think like the way that they\nmight be treated in a public school\nsetting I mean as a child who has ADHD\nret traumatizes them in a\nway um yeah and it's it's funny I think\nthat I I've had many clients come to me\nthat when I start working with them the\nfirst thing they start talking about is\nbullies in the school system when they\nthink about being traumatized that's the\nfirst place that their their brain goes\nto and from what I do as a clinician I'm\nthinking about how did your parents help\nyou with that then I'm starting to poke\naround about the trauma at home with it\nso absolutely I also think about you\nknow ASD and other neurodivergent kind\nof kids um it's just really a brutal\ndisaster for them in a neurotypical\nworld so there's lots of trauma that\ncomes from from that and I think\nwhere if the the family is Health enough\nhealthy enough and psych minded enough\nand sort of good enough parenting and\nknowing what's going on with the kids\nthey can really soften that blow of\nwhat's going on in the social component\nat\nschool thank you for that Patrick and Dr\nK what do you think is the connection\nbetween trauma and ADHD and what is the\nimpact when these exist\ncomorbidly that's a great question so um\nI'm going to kind of build a little bit\non what Patrick said because I think he\nhit all the the high points so a couple\nthings and I'm going to start with this\nwhich I I thought he did a great job of\ndescribing so I think we need to all\nunderstand that generally speaking it is\ntraumatic for a neurod Divergent kid to\nbe raised in a neurotypical world and\nthere's plenty of evidence it's a bold\nstatement but there's plenty of evidence\nso one study for example found that by\nthe second grade a child with ADHD will\nget invited to zero birthday parties so\nif we sort of think a little bit about\nyou know even kids that are six and\nseven will be able to tell the\ndifference in terms of neurod Divergence\nso that if we kind of think about how do\nyou get invited to a birthday party well\nat school on the playground where we all\nwant to use the slide and we get in line\nand so what often times happens with\nkids with ADHD is they don't know how to\nwait their turn in line so they cut in\nfront of other kids their social impacts\nthat leads to isolation and once we\nstart once isolation enters the picture\nthat's when we open the door to things\nlike PTSD or depression so one study for\nexample found that you asked about cor\ncomorbidity which is a great uh question\nMichelle so if we sort of think about\nthere was one study that looked at\npeople who have ADHD and depression and\nwhat they found is that 3% of kids who\nget diagnosed with depression will grow\nup to to have ADHD but 70% of kids who\nget diagnosed with ADHD first will end\nup with depression so ADHD really does\nappear to have a positive impact in\ndevelop uh in depression in in later in\nlife and I think it's kind of what what\nPatrick is sort of alluding to that\nthese kids have harder experiences and\nwhen I work with patients what this kind\nof looks like is like if you're a kid\nlet's say who's 10 years old 11 years\nold 12 years old you know that you're\njust as smart as every other kid in the\nclass you know you're not smarter you\nknow you're not stupider but for some\nreason you can't do what your teacher is\nasking you to do everyone else can sit\nand study but you're the one who gets in\ntrouble and so for and and so if you're\na child how do you understand that so\nwhat these kids Come Away with is sort\nof this idea that I'm fundamentally\nbusted in some way not sure what it is\nbut I'm just as smart I can do sometimes\nI can study just as well as anybody else\nsometimes I can pay attention and so\nwhat happens is as they go through this\nupbringing with ADHD and if there aren't\nenough people around them to support\nthem in terms of this is by the way this\nis how you need to wait your turn in\nline so parents can kind of entrain that\nbehavior if a school system is\nsupportive enough they can give the\nchild some degree of accommodation and\nand so it's kind of like the deck is\nstacked against the kid and then as they\ngrow up and they're not able to go to\nbirthday parties is they're not able to\ndo well in school if you kind of think\nabout my identity you know what am I\nproud of I'm proud of having friends I'm\nproud of doing well in school and so\nthey sort of get deprived of that stuff\nand then it develops into something like\ndepression or trauma kind of later in\nlife and I think it's interesting that\nyou bring that up because sometimes\nteachers will sort of exacerbate that\nlike teachers will point out that the\nstudent isn't focusing in class like\nit's almost like the teacher kind of um\nostracizes or marginalizes the child and\nthat just makes it worse and then the\nother kids kind of pick up on that how\ndo you feel like teachers and mental\nhealth professionals need to you know\napproach children in a more empathetic\nway or how can they do that yeah that's\na great question and you know it's it's\nkind of weird because uh there's\ndefinitely some things was that for me\nor Patrick I'm sorry it's it's for you\nand then for Patrick okay um so so I\nthink the first thing we've got to\nunderstand is that the rate so there's\none study that shows that the rate of\nADHD\ndiagnosis depends on the teacher student\nratio wow so the more students there are\nin the class the more likely they are to\nget diagnosed with ADHD so the first\nthing I think we've got to understand is\nthat often times our teachers are\nalready like overworked and in\ndisadvantageous\nsituations so often times what happens\nis that when there's more attention to\nbe given to a child with ADHD they act\nout less it's not that they're acting\nout less it's that there's more kind of\naccommodation given um I think in in my\nexperience so the biggest thing that\nteachers can do is to ask the question\nwhy right so if there's one child who's\nconstantly disruptive if we think about\nour teaching model what do we do to\ndisruptive children we punish them in\nsome way right that's how we get\nbehavior in line we show them hey this\nis wrong this is right and you're spoton\nthat other kids pick up on that so ADHD\nkids also wind up as the class clown\nbecause that's how they end up socially\nsort of getting some respect or actually\num I've heard this a lot or the bad kid\nquote un\nwhich is really sad to be labeled that\nabsolutely right so they develop some\nkind of identity about how I fit in with\nthings and and so I I think the tricky\nthing for that that I think a lot of\nteachers don't have the bandwidth for so\nI don't really blame them for this but I\nthink the most important thing is to ask\nwhy is this child behaving this way\nright to really dig into as opposed to\nthinking okay this child is is a pain\nright which they may be objectively in\nclass they're very disruptive but the\nquestion is why what's going on at home\nbecause there could be trauma there\ncould be abuse there could be ADHD and I\nthink the the patients that I've worked\nwith and the teachers that I've worked\nwith the best outcomes come when\nteachers sort of ask the question what's\ngoing on here as opposed to let's try to\nfix it so good diagnosis precedes good\ntreatment exactly thank you for that Dr\nK and then Patrick what is your take on\nthat and how teachers and mental health\nprofessionals need to approach it or\napproach it with more\nempathy I love the conversation because\nI was thinking almost like in a parental\nattachment with the teacher because the\nwe're you know we're so you know every\nday in in public school with this one\nperson from September to may like\nthey're they're like a parental figure\nand I think about like almost like\ngoodness of fit I had some teachers that\ncould recognize some teachers could not\nbe triggered by my attention seeking\nbehaviors because I was that class clown\nsome teachers could work with me on it\num other teachers would really be\ntriggered by it so I think it kind of\ndepends and I'm not trying to demonize\nyou know uh teachers at all they were\njust trying to get through their day but\nat the same time too they can you know I\nI really think about it in my mindset of\nlike growing up in the 80s or the 90s\nwhere you know I mean there really\nwasn't a discussion about what kids it\nwasn't even you know we didn't even know\nwhat these things were so I just think\nabout it in terms of that way ter I\nthink it really depends on the teacher\nto be able to to connect with a kid\noutside of what they're struggling with\nor the teacher tends to just kind of be\nreally bootstrapping get it together you\nknow what I mean you're not going to\namount to anything we like there's so\nmuch so much trauma happens in those\nSchool settings you know yeah exactly\nespecially teachers who tell children\nthat like you're not going to mount to\nanything or you know you're you know\nlazy I feel like there should be some s\nsome sort of penalty for that or some\nsort of training to you know help\nteachers approach it differently because\nthat could actually\nprogress is slow but I think a lot of\nschool systems are are becoming way more\neducated on this but the other piece too\nis I've had a lot of clients that are\nable to tell me that they did have one\nsoft gentle teacher that really went to\nB for them that could really meet them\nand give them connection that they\nweren't getting at home about a problem\nlike when a teacher says like I know\nthis isn't the real you or something\nlike that you know what I mean or I know\nthat you know like um I could see you I\ncould see what's going on for you I\nthink that's what I'm trying to say\nthank you for that Patrick and I agree\nand I just want to know what suggestions\ndo you have for someone who struggling\nwith ADHD and maybe substance abuse\ndisorder or PTSD and what are some\neffective coping mechanisms or treatment\noptions and I'll start with Dr\nK okay um so so the question was about\nADHD like how do you approach ADHD\nsubstance use and Trauma as a bundle\nyeah as a well yeah I mean since\nsometimes they exist comorbidly oh\nabsolutely they ex exist comorbidly a\nlot yeah I mean as a bundle I guess\nwe're talking about this because a lot\nof people they deal with so many issues\ncomorbidly and they don't know what to\ndo they're emotionally exhausted and\ndrained and I know Dr K that you did a\nvideo on this on how draining and\ndepressing ADHD can be for people yeah\nno I mean I I think the real sad thing\nMichelle is that they do exist\ncomorbidly it's a it's a great question\nbecause I think these are the people so\nlike the problem is that right so the\nproblem is that if you've got one of\nthese things there's an answer\nbut the more of these things that you\nhave the more complicated the answer\nbecomes so where do you start right so\ndo you deal with the addiction first do\nyou deal with the trauma first do you\ndeal with the ADHD first you know what's\ngoing on\nhere and so I I think let's understand I\nthink there are a couple of common\nPathways that we can sort of understand\nthe development of that will give us\nsome insight on where to start so the\nfirst is that let's start with like\nemotional regulation because I think\nthis is a key key common path way to all\nthree of these things so sometimes\npeople think okay I have three problems\nto solve but the cool thing is sometimes\nthere's one thing that you will you can\ndo that can improve all three so we know\nthat kids with ADHD their brain is wired\ndifferent to where their amigdala in\ntheir lyic system which is our emotional\ncircuitry of the brain is kind of\nhyperactive it's fidgety so a small\nthing can really upset kids a lot and\nthey can get really really kind of angry\nor hyperfocused very easily\nso there's even a there's a subgroup of\nresearchers who are hypothesizing that\nthere's a different variant of ADHD that\nis specifically emotional disregulation\nso these people have powerful emotions\nthat they can't control now if we look\nat something like addictions when I have\npowerful emotions that I can't control\nwhat do I do with those emotions well it\nturns out there are substances that I\ncan physiologically ingest and will\nbiologically alter the emotions that I\nfeel so having ADHD makes you more prone\nto addiction due to a combination of\nimpulsivity which leads to addiction and\na lack of emotional regulation because\nyou can't regulate your own emotions so\nyou're going to reach for a substance\nand that's what your brain learns is\ngoing to help\nit next thing to understand is if we\nlook at something like trauma so what\nhappens in in trauma I'm generalizing\nhere is if you look at the brains of\npeople with trauma there's this part of\nour brain called the corpus\nwhich connects our emotional brain to\nour logical brain we've got a right\nHemisphere and left left hemisphere the\nCorpus colossum is what allows them to\ntalk now what happens in trauma is when\npeople dissociate their emotions get\ndisconnected from the rest of their\nbrain so activity across that Corpus\ncolossum actually stops or doesn't stop\nit reduces and so what happens in trauma\nis when I feel a ton of emotion it's\noverwhelming for my brain so I\ndissociate and then I'm looking at\nthings kind of like what Patrick was\ndescribing that's sort of the more\nHollywood version of I'm looking down at\nmyself I don't feel anything I feel numb\neven though I'm going through a bad\nsituation so if we look at these things\nemotional disregulation trig or\nemotional disregulation triggers\ndissociation which causes all kinds of\nproblems emotional disregulation causes\nus to reach for substances as a coping\nskill and emotional disregulation is\npart of the wiring of ADHD\nso if we look at where should we start I\nwould start with emotional regulation so\nwhether that is learning mindfulness\ntechniques whether that's processing\nyour emotions on kind of a daily basis\nthrough journaling or seeing someone\nlike a a therapist or psychiatrist but\nreally leveling up your emotional coping\nskills is like the one thing that\nbenefits all three of those and when I'm\nworking with someone that's really what\nI start with and you can even use coping\nmechanisms like one thing that I'll I'll\nteach people is exercising as hard as\nyou can for 60 seconds um and what I'm\ntalking about is like pretend that\nyou're being chased by a monster in a\nhorror movie so when you have just\nabsolute maximal exercise for a\n60-second period it activates a very\npowerful calming response which will\nreally calm down your emotions after\nthat so it's something it's weird you\ncan't do this at work but really what\nI'll tell people to do is like we'll go\nout of my office we'll cross the street\nand we will you'll run as hard as you\ncan 30 seconds that way and 30 seconds\nback in the park like outside of my\noffice and if you can do that it really\ncalms you down so it really starts with\nwhatever emotional regulation works for\nyou thank you Dr K and then Patrick what\nyou know coping suggestions would you\nyou know recommend that was really well\nsaid because that bundle is super well\nany bundle any bundle of\nproblems I think about it where\nsomeone's someone's struggling with\nalcohol or drugs ADHD and childhood\ntrauma they they they come in and they\nwant to work on their childhood trauma\nbecause they know what what happened to\nthem growing up or what they went\nthrough is driving the two other things\nbut when we start to do some childhood\ntrauma I'm now disregulated them more\nso so it's sort of like with the trauma\npiece of being really the last piece\nafter some long-term sobriety that's\ngood enough for them some like all all\nof that treatment that Dr K re like sort\nof recommended like um reg learning how\nto regulate your system um is one thing\nso that's I want to kind of say that is\nusually it's the last part for someone\nto be prepared to willingly want to\ndisregulated themselves by talking about\nwhat happened to them that takes a lot\nof kind of footwork that takes a lot of\na little bit of time a little more sort\nof pre stuff to happen um but also when\nI think about the substance abuse and\nADHD and Trauma so much shame there's so\nmuch shame around calling in sick to\nwork I just mean the the really the\ncluster of the whole\nlifestyle of relationships tanking or a\nlot of it isolation but in a way you\nknow for those when I'm processing say\nwith a with a client and they started\nsmoking cigarettes and doing drugs\naround 12 or 13 years old I might kind\nof you know address the shame piece and\nsay good for you for coming up with a\nway to reset your system or deal with a\npain on some level because you weren't\ngetting that help at home so in a way\nlike where when they come in it's just\nlike it can be really uh I don't know if\nif if Dr K has had this experience where\ncan they can might feel a little bit\nhumbled if we're asking them to do\nmindfulness exercises when they have\nsuch big\nproblems so speaking to that it's kind\nof you really have to have a really good\ndialogue and conversation about first\nthings first but also really kind of say\nI get it why you came up with this stuff\nyou know I mean I really get that you\nknow and and almost like good for you\nthat you came up with this stuff because\nyou you it was like a pressure release\nto reset you know it's\nlike when I used to be a smoker I my\nmindset used to be I'm going to have\nthis cigarette then I'll go back into\nwork and do these things it was a way\nfor me to set the moment to reset my\nemotions into sort of next steps and I\nthink that makes me think about that\nwith with substance abuse I mean it's I\nmean it's a lot more messy than smoking\nand go going back into work but I love\nthat you brought that up because you\ntalk about resetting the moment which in\na way do you think that could be\nsomething healthy if you do it without\nsmoking like maybe with a cup of coffee\nor with yeah yeah just like well in in\nwhat Dr K is suggesting is we are trying\nto\ngive them comfort and help them be seen\nwhile\nreplacing the coping strategy that's\ngoing to take them out and be really bad\nfor them with a new coping Strate a new\nway to regulate your system running for\na solid minute learning how to meditate\nlearning how to put stuff away and just\nget something done for just a few\nminutes and just how to like and I'm not\nan ADHD sort of like expert but just\nsort of for those therapists that are\nable to kind of help them just do things\ndifferently is a replacement but at the\nsame time too if someone is is addicted\nto a hardcore if someone is is is a is a\nphysical dependency to alcohol they need\nto be in a in a in a facility that's\nsafe for them to titrate down and all\nyou know I mean we're not going to be\ngiv the mindfulness and hope for the\nbest kind of a thing there's there's\ndepending on how much substance abuse is\ngoing on exactly well thank you for that\nPatrick and now we're going to switch\nover to our audience segment where we\nanswer your viewer questions our experts\nanswer the your questions so let's begin\nso this first question is for Dr K Ethan\nask is my ADHD causing me to have porn\naddiction I'm really struggling what\nadvice can you give\nme that's a loaded question wow yeah so\nis your ADHD causing porn addiction so\nthis is I'm sorry to say Ethan you can't\nget a pass on that you've got some\npersonal\nresponsibility here's what what we need\nto understand there's a lot of stuff to\nunderstand though the first is that your\nADH is\nabsolutely making you more vulnerable to\npornography\naddiction so this is where I you know I\nthink it's interesting because what's\nthe relationship between the two and I\nfound so I I do primarily addiction\nPsychiatry work and and I find that when\nI have a patient who says is my\ndepression the cause of my addiction I\nfind that that's a little bit tricky\nbecause it implies that if you fix the\nroot problem the addiction will go away\nwhereas the addiction has its own life\nat this point so I think that your ADHD\nabsolutely enhances the vulnerability\nand makes your brain more likely to be\naddicted to pornography whereas a\nneurotypical brain may have it\neasier now what we know about the brains\nof people with ADHD is that they have a\nlot of difficulty with impulse control\nin emotional regulation and if you look\nat fmri studies so these are uh brain\nscan studies which look at the brains of\npeople who are addicted to pornography\nwhat you actually find is that the\nprimary thing that pornography addiction\ndoes is emotional\nregulation so literally what happens is\nwhen people are\nfeeling more emotion but they're not\noftentimes aware of it because we're so\nnumbed out and from the pornography\nwe're not even aware of it but what\nyou'll find is throughout the day you'll\nhave these impulses to watch and if you\ntrack those impulses back to their root\nwhat you'll often times fine is that\nthere's some kind of emotion at Play\nBecause if we look at what pornography\ndoes you know there there are very\npowerful circuits in our brain that are\ngeared towards procreation because\nthat's like the purpose of the species\nand so these are things that will make\nwill really suppress your negative\nemotions will really activate certain\nparts of your nervous system um will\ntrigger things like dopamine which can\nfeel good and so when we're feeling bad\nwe reach for the pornography the real\nchallenge here is that pornography is\ngetting more addictive so it's not just\nthat you have a vulnerability to it it's\nthat there's actually an industry which\nis trying to figure out how to get you\nto watch more pornography and so it's\nsuper challenging and the two absolutely\nintersect um but I think one thing to\nunderstand is that treating either one\nwill help the other but fixing one won't\nnecessarily fix the other so you kind of\ngot to fight a war on two fronts there\nthank you Dr K Patrick do you have any\nthoughts on that question or your take\non it well well said you know where all\nyou know also just to you know probably\nwith every one of these questions I'm\njust going to be having everyone be\nthoughtful about was their childhood\ntrauma at play that might cause\nstrategies you know what I mean like\nwhere you know someone like that would\ncome into my office is my ADHD causing\nmy porn addiction my I the first thing I\nwant to flush out was how did the family\nof G and deal with issues around sex you\nknow were it was it\nyes sexualized was this household super\nrepressed you know like the the tale of\nthe classic American sort of boy my age\nwe all find magazines at way too much of\na young age you know I'm I'm always\nthinking about we we all needed healthy\nparents to have have conversations with\nus around that time and I think that\nthose are the things that I think would\nconf factor to developing the coping\nstrategy of of porn addiction just\nanother thing to kind of reset our\nsystem or to get a little hit of\nsomething you\nknow thank you Patrick and I wanted to\nthrow this next question to you it's um\nHamman ask is my ADHD causing me to\npractice escapism which I would say is I\nthink they're asking like um is it the\nsame as like dissociating maybe that's\nwhat they're referring\nto can we are we do we have the ability\nto ask them because I escapism is that\nlike you're going into a little bit of\nfantasy in your mind or daydreaming or\nare you talking about like dropping\neverything and living in a van for 10\nmonths because you want to you know what\nI mean and that's not like maybe like a\nwellth thought out kind of kind of\nthing escapism\nlike for 10 months sounds very well\nthought out and a great idea to\n[Laughter]\nme um let's\nsee so in terms of\ndissociation yeah so like I think that\nthat's what they mean like um they're\nescaping like their problems or they're\npracticing escapism such as dissociating\nto deal with the\nADHD yeah and it could be again I'm\nthinking\nabout is it something that was developed\nas a child to just kind of go a little\nbit blank or go into a little bit of of\nfantasy or to go because it's it's just\nis it one of the traditional trauma\nresponses of just kind freeing a little\nbit but that's where I think it's more\nof a question not so much an answer for\nme but just to kind of get you to think\nabout like in a way if if children are\nnot growing up in\nsafety they're going to have an\noveractive lyic system amydala trauma\nbrain they're going to have difficulty\nkeeping their PR prefrontal cortex\nonline I couch that conversation\ndepending on how what people like some\npeople have an aversion to to inner\nchild you know uh semantics but our\ntrauma brain is a lot like our inner\nchild and our our prefrontal cortex is a\nlot like our inner adult who can kind of\nbe more focused on the moment so I'm not\nreally probably giving the the a good\nanswer here but it can like you know\nlike the last question ADHD can\ncontribute to the dissociation they can\nkind of go hand in hand I think my\nanswer would be to just make sure to\nflush out and not rule like to to figure\nout if it's coming from a place of\ntrauma as\nwell thank you so much Patrick and then\nI have a question for both of you I'll\nstart with Dr K Joel Demetrius Johnson\nasked is my inattentive ADHD and\ndepression linked or are they separate\nfrom each other I also developed PTSD\nfrom my mother's passing in 2009 my\ncondolences Joel um if I can actually\njust chime in on the last one for a\nsecond just a slightly different\nperspective and then I'm gonna punt this\none to to Patrick because I I'd love to\nhear his answer to this one uh so just\njust a quick point so one thing that I\nthought was really interesting um so\nmaladaptive daydreaming is on the\nrise and and so it's really interesting\nand I was looking into it because like\nyou know we were kind of wondering what\ndoes this person mean by escapism and I\nthink dissociation is a completely Fair\num interpretation of the question but uh\nwhat we've been seeing a lot in our\ncommunity is is maladaptive daydreaming\nso it's not quite dissociation but\nthey'll really get lost in like\nfantasies for extended periods of time\nand there are actually some um you know\nstudies that really suggest that this is\nanother subtype of\nADHD that uh when we sort of\nemotionally once again when we're we'll\nsort of enter this Daydream to help\nmanage our emotions and there's\nsomething about the attention component\nthere as well because instead of\nfocusing on the real day we get kind of\nlost in this fantasy so it's kind of\nlike this perfect storm of like like\ndistraction and getting lost in this\nfantasy which happens with the\nattentional deficits combined with\nsomething else that kind of results in\nthis sort of escapism or daydreaming or\nsomething like that so it's just\nsomething that's definitely on the rise\nand I think we'll be hearing more about\nbecause I think that many people have\nhimani's\nexperience um of of kind of getting lost\nin this world when they have ADHD and\nthey're not quite sure is a dissociation\nwhat's going\non um and and i' I'd love to hear\nPatrick's kind of take on on this\nquestion if that's okay because I I\nreally appreciate his his uh really\nattachment perspective and I'd love to\nhear I think he's just a really robust\nthinker on this how would you approach\nsomeone who kind of combines this\ninattentive ADHD and depression and\ndevelopment\nstuff I'm gonna ask a question on top of\nthe question for you I'm glad you said\nthat last piece Dr K is could any of\nthat maladaptive daydreaming be related\nto social media or\nscens or the change in the last 10 or 15\nyears about where our culture has gone\nthere I think it could but there is um\nthe studies really look at maladaptive\ndaydreaming and I think what what social\nmedia really does is it creates spaces\nfor us to get lost in so whereas before\nyour brain had to do all the work to\nconstruct a fantasy whereas now if we\nwant to Escape it's really easy right\nbecause all I have to do is open up a\nlittle bit of social media and then I am\nboarding the dopamine train which will\noccupy me for the next four hours of\nDoom scrolling and suppress all of my\nnegative emotions especially through\nthings like video games and stuff like\nthat so I think we're absolutely seeing\na link and I I'd love to kind of hear\nyour perspective on this too around the\nrise of techn technology and kind of as\ntechnology gets more sophisticated and\nit's impacting our attention span for\nsure right right thank you for that um\nCan Can I see the question that was that\nI was up on deck for yeah um actually um\nI'll just summarize it Joel Demetrius\nasked um he asked is my depression and\nADHD linked and um also my PTSD from my\nmother's\npassing um I don't really know how to\nanswer this question I can't say yes or\nno but where my brain goes with it is I\nthink it's interesting then the way that\nwe want to think about causation and\nseparate these issues depression and\nADHD and the trauma is you know I just\nthink that I'll answer it with this that\nI think with good\nPsychotherapy and processing I'm I'm\nvery sorry for the loss of your mom\nprocessing mom's\npassing I think that with good\nPsychotherapy comes good energetic\nshifts in space so so in a way things\nmight get better with the depression and\nthe anxiety but I think what you know I\nthink what what the the questioners are\nsort of asking is like and is this\ncausing that and what do I address first\nor whatever and I think if you're just\nable to kind of talk with somebody who\nyou like who is effective with you is it\nmay not be so much about what causes\nwhat or or separating the two things\nmore so about you know just it would be\nbeautiful for all of us just to have\nmore head\nspace and some more calmness so that's\nmaybe the best way that I can kind of\nlike address that kind of\nquestion thank you Patrick and then jar\nasked and this one's for Dr K what is\nADHD Doom scrolling and how do how do I\nescape from it thank you for answering\nquestions since you mentioned technology\nyeah so so um you know I wish I had a\nbetter answer for this but because this\nis a evolving problem so the first thing\nto\nunderstand is that technology companies\nare competing for your attention because\nthe more of your attention they get the\nmore money they make and so we have a\nbattle between these Tech Giants right\nthings like YouTube and Amazon and Tik\nTok and meta and they're all fighting\nfor your attention the key thing is no\nmatter which of them wins the one person\nwho always loses is you because now you\nare spending more time on the device as\nall of these these platforms become more\nand more engaging and I don't think that\nthey're nefarious about it by the way I\ndon't think they're evil or anything\nlike that I think they just have a job\nto do which is to serve people the best\ncontent that they find the most engaging\nright so so that's their goal is to keep\nyou\nclicking the next thing to understand is\nthat if you have ADHD you have\nparticular vulnerabilities that make it\neasier for them to kind of engage you so\nI'll give you just very simple examples\nso people say ADHD Doom scrolling is\ntough I completely agree but I've seen\nthe most benefit not in terms of\nstopping the Doom scrolling but\npreventing it in the first place so just\nto give you a very simple trick that I\ngive to people with ADHD our phone makes\nit easier and easier for us to access\ndistracting things so once you start\nscrolling you're going to Doom scroll\nand then it's hard to stop so the\nquestion is what can you do to slow down\nthe engagement of the Doom scrolling so\nnow we have things like face ID where I\njust pick up my phone and I'm not even\nintending to look at anything and the\nthe phone sees my face it unlocks and it\nopens up Reddit or Twitter or whatever I\nhave there and then now like We're Off\nto the Races right because now there's\nsome engaging piece of content that kind\nof sucks you in so the tricky thing is\nwith ADHD we are more impulsive and so\nso what we really want to do if you want\nto bypass Doom scrolling is you need to\nincrease the time between an impulse and\nthe gratification of that impulse so\nwhat I would say is disable uh phone\nlock or like like finger lock disable\nphone ID make it as much of a pain in\nthe ass as possible to engage with\ntechnology so uninstall native apps and\nuse a browser to browse something like\nTwitter or or what\nso I recently uninstalled the Reddit app\nfrom my phone and I use a web browser to\naccess Reddit because it adds an\nadditional step so the key thing about\nADHD is you have an impulse and if you\ncan satisfy that impulse and you board\nthe Doom scrolling train within one\nsecond which by the way is how long it\ntakes now because they're getting better\nbetter at like making it easy for you to\nget to your content stretch it out to\nfive seconds 10 seconds 15 seconds and\nthen the impulse just as quickly as it\nwent away it arises it'll disappear too\nthat's one of the advantages of ADHD so\nall you have to do is ride out the\nimpulse ride out the impulse yeah so I\nthink that's really that that's what I\nfound to be more effective than stopping\nto Doom uh stopping Doom scrolling is\npreventing Doom scrolling in the first\nplace because it leads you down a rabbit\nhole absolutely right so once I look at\none Reddit post I lose 30 minutes so the\nbig change that's happened with\ntechnology is back when I was like\nstudying in high school I would be at a\nlibrary and I have a textbook if I get\ndistracted I get distracted for 30\nseconds there's nothing else to do so I\ngo back to reading the textbook now the\nproblem is we carry our phones around so\ngetting distracted a 5-second\ndistraction now costs you 30 minutes so\ntry to increase the barriers of access\nas much as you\ncan thank you Dr K and then this\nquestion is for Patrick and it's from\ndevil Blues she ask maybe ADHD is a sign\nof not feeling safe in the body due to\nFrozen traa traum from the past this is\nan interesting question what do you\nthink\nPatrick um I just love the conversation\nthis just you know\ncould all day um maybe ADHD is a sign of\nnot feeling safe in the body due to a\nfrozen trauma I love the question\nbecause I I think that for childhood\ntrauma survivors there are just um\nbeliefs\nsituations um family dynamics that kind\nof run Us in the background like a like\na refrigerator buzz you don't really\nknow it's there until you kind of pick\nup on it for example um you're you know\nyou're in the fifth grade and your\nparents go through like a really\nhorrific\ndivorce and you get forgotten in that\nit's really really\nnasty and I think until we kind of get\nthe chance to process that with somebody\nand really kind of talk it through and\ndo some work around that I think it kind\nof runs Us in the background and I think\nif you have organic ADHD if if that's\neven a thing Dr K is that a fair two\nwords put together organic ADHD to say\nthat it's not caused by childhood\ntrauma uh I mean yes and no so so what's\na better term so so I mean I I I think\nthat so what's the opposite of organic\nthat's that's kind of my question for\nyou yeah right so because when I think\norganic I sort of think biological and I\nsort of think the opposite of that at\nleast in our field is like psychological\nyeah so but but I I think the two go\nhand inand um so so I I think there's\nabsolutely a genetic neurodevelopmental\naspect to ADHD but I think there's\nabsolutely like all the issues that I at\nleast I come to you to learn for uh uh\nyou know like attachment and development\nand that kind of stuff and it gets so\nintertwined I don't use the term organic\nADHD got it got it thank you for that um\nso for the fro like a frozen trauma in\nthe background that can very much\ncontribute to our uh symptoms of of\nbeing in our head or dissociation or\nshame and anxiety and again I think that\nthis stuff is like a big soup so it's\ngoing to be affecting um probably some\nADHD and in a way to think about it like\nwhere say you're going through a bad\npatch and you've been reflecting on your\nchildhood trauma or you've been\ntriggered by a relationship and you're\njust not your best and you go to a party\nand so that trauma is in the background\nand the triggers are kind of in the\nbackground and that might contribute to\nyou being a little bit more in your ADHD\nsymptoms because now you're at a social\nevent at a party you might be a little\nbit more impulsive and overshare for\nsome reason because you're nervous so\nthat's what I mean about where my brain\ngoes to that stuff and I think again if\nwe can if you have childhood trauma to\nfind somebody and start to do some good\nwork with somebody I think a lot of\nstuff gets turned turn down in a really\ngood way creating some space um and most\nimportantly I'm a big advocate for\nchanging the narrative about yourself in\ncontext of how we grow\nup I love that like you like oh you were\njust kind of a dumb goofy kid Class\nClown kind of a thing that needs to be\nshifted to you weren't being safe at\nhome you were trying to get your own\nneeds met you know none of it was your\nfault kind of stuff I love that thank\nyou Patrick and then um girl asks how to\ncombat ADHD burnout and depression this\num I'll throw this one to Dr K and then\nPatrick um so I I think first step is is\nactually differentiating out the\nconcepts because I think they're quite\ndiscreet so let's start with that so the\nfirst is\nburnout oftentimes comes with depression\nbut burnout usually comes\nfrom trying really hard and not seeing a\nresult right so I'm going to kind of\nfocus on this which is very common for\npeople with ADHD so what happens when\nyou've got ADHD is you have a world that\nis designed for brains that are not\nyours and so what you have to do is try\nextra hard or develop\nadaptations that are more costly right\nso other people can move through life\nrelatively easier but everything causes\na lot of friction for you it's hard to\nmake friends even like socializing\nbecomes something that you have to spend\na lot of effort in because you know you\nshouldn't be interrupting people you\nshould be paying attention you just\nintroduced yourself and you forgot what\nthis person's name is and so if you you\nlook at sort of the experience of people\nwith ADHD they're very burnout prone\nbecause\nthey expend a lot of effort and it\nrequires twice as much effort to get\nwhat a neurotypical person may get so\nthen if we sort of look at okay what\nhappens with people with ADHD and and\nwhy does this happen and what can we do\nabout it a big part of it is if you look\nat will power the biggest cognitive\ndrain that we have is exerting willpower\nso if you are in a situation where you\nhave to try really hard to keep your\nADHD in check that's going to be\nincredibly draining and lead to burnout\nthe cool thing is there are some\ncircuits in our brain in ADHD that are\ncompletely intact so one example of this\nis the Habit circuits of the brain and\nthis is like the endoc canabo system so\na lot of like uh ADHD is governed by\nlike dopamine and the nucleus cumb and\nstuff like that but there's a different\ncircuit in our brain which is how habits\nform and that's completely intact and so\na lot of times the situations that cause\nyou to burn out what are things that you\ncan do to develop habits in those\nsituations instead of exert willpower\nand the more that you can do that the\nless burnt out you will be just to give\none example so I had uh I've worked with\na ton of people who for get names okay\nso that they'll introduce themselves and\nthey'll forget names in social\nsituations which Mak socialization hard\nso just simply practicing I'm going to\nrepeat the name three times or I'm going\nto use the name in my response to them\nworks wonders so hi Michelle or like you\nknow you you'll introduce yourself as\nMichelle I'll I'll say hi I'm allo and\nthen I'll say it's nice to meet you\nMichelle and so when you practice some\nof these habits and you engage that\nhabit circuitry it removes the load\nbecause abits are automatic and then\nthat sort of increases the battery that\nyou've got for other things and really\nhelps with the burnout awesome thank you\nfor that Dr Kon um what advice would you\ngive\nPatrick um for Burnout where that was\nreally that was really well said in my\nworld um for childhood trauma survivors\nand again I know I don't want to sort of\nnot trying to say that every one of\nthese like sort of those contributing\nthe questions have childhood trauma but\njust like a different to kind of think\nabout things is if a client comes in is\nis talking about burnout in\nADHD again my world would be thinking\nabout are they trying too hard in a from\nin in their world from a place of\nchildhood trauma are they people\npleasing are did they grow up in poverty\nand they're just a juggernaut just\ntrying to make a salary even though they\ndon't really need to make that much\nbecause the salary keeps them safe on\nsome level and they're not kind of\naddressing that kind of pain so the\nburnout is just to to also consider like\nwhat might be childhood beliefs if you\nhave childhood trauma that's running\nthat like I love the way Dr K said it's\njust like willpower our will like so\nmuch cognitive energy goes into sort of\ndoing that that's our engine going\nthrough life and is our engine coming\nfrom a place of\nperfectionism competition shame those\nkinds of those kind of ideas that might\nit may not cure the burnout it doesn't\nit doesn't immediately solve being\neither workaholic or being having to\nwork several jobs because of capitalism\nor something like that but it does help\nthe\nemotions thank you for that Patrick and\nthat concludes our audience segment I\nhave one last question for both of you\nwhy do you guys believe that more and\nmore people are coming forward with\ntheir ADHD struggles and you know we\ntalked about how people are ostracized\nby having ADHD but in this day and age\nin the age of social media do you\nbelieve it's actually becoming trendy\nyou\nknow K Dr K sure um for the record\nPatrick I think it's totally fine to\ntake a childhood trauma lens for all\nthese questions because I I think it's\nyou know I actually really appreciate\nthat perspective that you have and I\nthink it's something that our childhood\nshapes so much of what we we have as\nadults and and for everyone listening\nout there I think I you know the number\nof patients I've been able to help by\ngaining sight of that perspective is\nastronomical and I think a lot of the\nstuff that Patrick is talking about I\nthink is really\ntransformative once you really get into\nit and I love the way that he kind of\nreframes things right so to understand\nthat an addiction that you developed was\nyour survival mechanism because you were\n13 years old and you didn't know any\nbetter completely changes your narrative\nand shame and stuff like that so\nstrongly encourage youall to really\nthink about what Patrick is saying um\ngoing back to the question at hand about\nADHD and and why it's on the rise right\nand what the connection between yeah and\nthose who uh argue that it's becoming\nnot something that's ostracize anymore\nbut something that's more trendy that's\nnot my opinion but like what some people\nhave been saying on the internet so I I\nthink that there is\na there's a growing trend\nof a couple of things on the internet\nthe first is there's awareness about\nmental illness which I think is good um\nI think the rates of ADHD diagnosis are\nincreasing which I think is probably\ngood I think I don't know if it's\nactually getting worse or we're just\ncatching it\nmore I also think that technology is\nshortening our attention span in\nreducing our ability to regulate our own\nemotions because it does the regulation\nfor us right if I'm feeling bad let me\nwatch a couple cat videos and then our\nbrain has this very simple function of\nif you don't use it you lose it so you\ncan study a language in high school and\nif you don't practice you forget it and\nin the same way we won't develop\nemotional regulation skills if we\nOutsource our emotional regulation to\ntechnology now if we look at even things\nlike YouTube content right so the more\nclick baity you make it the more\nengaging brighter colors zooming in and\nout a lot that all engages your\nattention um so that you don't have to\nfocus it yourself so I think all three\nof those things are happening and making\nADHD kind of worse on the flip side what\nwe're also starting to see is\ninterestingly enough a lot of compassion\nand understanding around ADHD which I\nthink is a good thing but then now\nwhat's starting to happen which I\nsometimes see and sorry if this is like\nnot the most PCY answer is that some\npeople will start to use it as an excuse\nright so I I've worked with a lot of\npeople who have struggled with very\nserious mental illnesses and one of the\nmost frustrating things is you know it's\nnot your fault but it is your\nresponsibility and what what happens a\nlot of the time is that people will sort\nof say like oh I'm not responsible for\nthis because I have\nADHD um and so I do think that there's a\nlot of self- diagnosis there's even like\na a fair number of studies now that are\ncoming out that suggest that a lot of\nthe self- diagnosis stuff is not very\naccurate um I think it's really harmful\nto the people who really are struggling\nwhen people kind of say hey I've got\nthis problem too so so and but at the\nsame time on on the flip side there are\na lot of people who have gone through\nlife not being diagnosed and the reason\nthat they really take it seriously is\nthat they see someone else talking about\nit and they say wow this is like me too\nright I never realized that this is a\nfeature of ADHD and I'm even thinking\nabout a beautiful uh video that that\nPatrick made where he was talking about\nthe overlap of trauma and ADHD and how\none can really look like the other and\nas we have that kind of content people\nare realizing oh crap I always thought I\nhad ADHD but I may have trauma and vice\nversa um and so I do think people are\nkind of like there's some you know\nunfortunate stuff kind of going on but\non the on the whole I think we're moving\nin the right direction definitely and\nthen Patrick what is your take on that\nand about like maybe social media\nenabling more people to either\nmisdiagnose or come out with their uh\ndiagnosis well I just want to say what\nDr K was very well said there um I have\nmixed emotions about it where you know\nwe have this it's like we have this\ninternet and we we don't we don't quite\nknow we don't quite know all the all the\npluses and minuses about it but the\npluses are um in the late\n90s um you when I started my own\nrecovery Journey you all you had was\nself-help books and I absolutely love\nthe amount of sea shifting change that\npeople can on and kind of maybe figure\nout and get an answer about what they're\nstruggling with whether that's about\ntheir family system about some\nsymptoms um and it's it's really such a\npowerful thing that is so helpful in the\nfield of mental health um where I get a\nlot of comments it's just like they\ncan't afford therapy or they're still\nliving at home or stuff like that and\nthis is this is all that they have and\nit's actually really helping them it's\nkeeping them buoyant it's it's keeping\nthem informed it's keeping it's reducing\nsome shame if they were able to name\nsomething or know that it's not about\nthem so that's the plus side um the\ndownside is is this is going to probably\nsound horrible but it can sometimes\nbecome a hobby it can sometimes become a\ndefault thing that even contributes to\nmore ADHD kind of a thing that just kind\nof stewing in it because it's so\navailable and then but the piece where\nfor those I would in a way\nthat um I would love to see a lot more\ninperson old school interaction for\npeople with mental health then Reddit is\namazing but you know what I mean like\nand there's like very skilled experts\nand in family stuff and narcissis and\nthat kind of a thing but the lack of\nhuman element what would happen if they\nwere all able to get into an actual room\nwith a therapist and do some work in\nthat way\nyou know I'm probably rambling or\nshaking my fist at a cloud like an old\nman um then the last part of that\nquestion\nis around whether it's so I don't think\nit's trendy I think it's we're stewing\nin it too much you know I I think it\nwe're just becoming like a hobby like\nthis is someone's gig they go home and\nthey spend hours on it which they might\nhave to just go do that for a period in\ntheir life but I just want to say join a\ngroup get into some kind of human action\nwith people even I I don't care what\nkind of group it is could be d and or\ngroup therapy just do something where\nyou're being more sort of social in that\nway and the last piece about it is I\nthink the neurodivergent\nlike education and I I think it's always\nbeen there I just think that now we're\nbeing much more sensitive to it but I\njust think about all the kids I went\ninto high that I went to school with all\nthose the three the the you know the\nthree of us on the call how many kids\ndid you know that were in a special\nneeds class what did that do to them\ntheir sense you know like so I think\nthat it's it's always kind of been there\nand I saw this hilarious Tik Tok where\nthe woman was mimicking her grandmother\nit was it was more about\nautism about behaviors that someone on\nthe autism spectrum does and it's a\ngrandmother kind of saying now don't\ntouch my knickknacks I want them this\nway and she's knitting and she's like I\ndon't know why you can't sit\nstill it's kind of I think this stuff\nhas always been there we just are now to\nAble kind of unpack it I think I think\nthat's amazing that you bring that up\ntoo um thank you Patrick for that and\nthat concludes our expert panel this was\nabsolutely enlightening and amazing and\nit's been an honor having both Patrick\nTian and Dr Kon thank you guys so much\nand thank you to our amazing\nviewers thank you all very much thank\nyou but thank you for having me love\nthis conversation great meeting awesome\ngreat meeting everyone today and\neveryone have a good day bye-bye\nokay"
