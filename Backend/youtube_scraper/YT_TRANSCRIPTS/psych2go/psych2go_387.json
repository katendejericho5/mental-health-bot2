    "transcript": "it was near Halloween when\nscared me to the Core\nI was serving online to kill time but at\nthe unusual idea to visit the place\nwhere no innocent should explore the\ndark web\nI opened up tour and got to work\nan hour looking through the dark web all\nthat investigating and nothing scary\nwere creepy\nI hadn't ordered anything online that\nday but I opened the door wide and they\nleft in a rush\n[Music]\nafter that visit put me on edge even\nmore\nleaving me with the Box\nso I did some digging on a creepy wax\nsealed box and many things came up most\nwebsites that it contained a demonic\nbeing sealed with a crystal inside to\ncontain the Demon's power in the Box\nafter searching online I put the Box in\na closet and locked it with a key which\nI keep around my neck\nalthough I kept the Box sealed in the\ncloset I still had my suspicions because\npicture frames fell down lights kept\nturning on and off and the creepiest of\nthem all the closet door shook violently\nI tried to do more research but it\ndidn't say much\nI had to think of a better way to get\nrid of the box\nI finally thought of a better idea for\nthe Box\nI buried the box tonight near a cemetery\nI knew it was a bad idea but I lived in\nan urban area so where else should I\nhave hidden it\nalthough these paranormal events stopped\nI still saw that man looking through my\nwindow\nmaybe my mind was playing tricks on me\nI'm still on guard so let's just say\nunusual things are still happening"
