flags just look like red\nflags and though the original context\ntalks about red flags and romantic\nrelationships the same can certainly be\ntrue for ourselves too don't you think\nbecause as hard as it is sometimes to\nspot the warning signs in our own\nrelationships and in the people we love\nit might be even harder to spot them in\nourselves because of our Tendencies to\nempathize and rationalize with our own\nchoices and actions with that said here\nare six red flags you need to look out\nfor in yourself according to experts\nnumber one unconstructive self-talk\npsychologist Dr

depression so if\nyou are guilty of constantly putting\nyourself down and having a lot of\nself-deprecating thoughts even the ones\nyou pass off as jokes then talking to a\nprofessional or applying

perfectly and without error\nand as such are only setting themselves\nup for failure and disappointment this\nis not only a definite red flag and a\nweakness but a harmful habit for your\nmental health\nnumber five avoidant attachment in an\narticle from betterhelp which was\nmedically reviewed by licensed clinical\nsocial worker April Justice people with\navoidant attachment Styles tend to be\nemotionally detached and closed off they\noften feel uncomfortable with long-term\ncloseness and Intimacy in relationships\nas a result their knee-jerk response is\nto avoid the other person or manifest\nother self-sabotaging behaviors such as\ncheating ghosting and never asking for\nhelp instead of communicating with the\nother person and collaborating on\nresolving the issue with them and number\nsix social media addiction another red\nflag you might not realize you have is\nsocial media addiction researchers like\nwho and others found in a 2019 study\nthat it negatively affected
