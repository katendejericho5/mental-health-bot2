    "transcript": "- It is quite true that man lives\nby bread alone when there is no bread.\nBut what happens to man's\ndesires when there is plenty\nof bread and when his\nbelly is chronically filled\nat once other and higher needs emerge\nand thieves rather than\nphysiological hungers\ndominate the organism?\nWhat's the meaning of life?\nWho are we? What do I need?\nWhat do I want? We often ask\nourselves these questions when\nour mind begins to wander,\nsilence fills the room\nand we're alone with nothing\nmore than our thoughts.\nBut what if I were to tell you\nthat there is a theory in psychology\nthat can not only help answer\nthose personal questions,\nbut it can help motivate you as well?\nI am talking about Maslow's\nhierarchy of needs.\nThis is a motivational\ntheory in psychology created\nby 20th century psychologist\nand philosopher Abraham Maslow,\nthe hierarchy being five tiers\nof a human's needs in life.\nThe bottom of the pyramid\nstarts with physiological needs\nand the top self-actualization.\nOne must satisfy their\nneeds on the lower part\nof the hierarchy before being able\nto focus on the higher\nlevels of the hierarchy.\nAlthough don't think that you have\nto fully satisfy the lower\nneeds before moving to the top.\nMaslow later stated that\nit's a false impression\nthat a need must be satisfied 100%\nbefore the next need emerges.\nSo what are these needs\nand can meeting each one\nin order help motivate you\nto the top self-actualization?\nThe answer to that life question,\nlet's break it down or up.\nPhysiological, do you\nget enough rest food?\nDrink plenty of water.\nDo you fulfill the\nbasics of human survival?\nWithout these needs being satisfied,\none often cannot function properly.\nThese biological needs\ninclude food, drink,\nshelter, clothing, warmth, reproduction,\nand sleep among others.\nIn order to focus on a\nhigher meaning in your life,\nyou'll need to survive first\nand attend to your basic biological needs.\nSince your physiological\nneeds are at the base\nof the pyramid or hierarchy as part\nof the first four levels,\nit's considered a deficiency.\nNeed deficiency needs occur when deprived\nof our basic biological needs.\nOf course, when deprived of something,\nyour focus will often be on regaining\nwhat it is you are desperately needing.\nSo if you go without food\nfor a long time, you will\nof course feel hungry\nand be motivated to\nsatisfy your need for food.\nThe longer without food, the stronger\nthat intensity to satisfy it.\nSo each tier you satisfy the\nmore your focus will turn\nupwards to the next\n- Set needs.\nUntil eventually you get out\nof those four deficient needs,\nthey become salient\nand your motivation shifts\nto growth needs the top tier.\nBut before we can get\nthere, we must continue\nto explain the rest of\nthe four deficient needs.\nUp next is safety.\nThe next needs you'll wanna satisfy\nto feel more motivated\nare your safety needs.\nThese include security of\nyour health, employment,\nresources, morality,\nfamily, body, and property.\nAre you taking care of your health?\nIs your job fairly secure\nso you can reduce stress\nto focus on additional needs?\nWhat about your family? Are you\ncaring for the ones you love\nas much as they care for you?\nAnd then we have love and belonging.\nWho do we genuinely get along\nwith? Who do we connect with?\nOnce you've satisfied and\nfocused a bit on your safety\nand physiological needs,\nyour mind may wander\nand you may begin to feel\nlonely If you don't have a sense\nof connection, do you\nfeel you need others more\noften in your life?\nDo you feel a part of a group?\nMaslow's love\nand belonging needs\ninclude family, friendship,\nintimacy, sexual intimacy,\nand a sense of connection.\nAfter we begin to satisfy these needs,\nwe may feel we finally belong somewhere.\nWe're comfortable with the\nconnections we've built.\nWhen we feel loved\nand have others in our lives,\nwe then shift our main focus\nonto something else ourselves,\nwhich brings us to esteem.\nDo you feel confident?\nHave you achieved something\nyou've strived for?\nDo others respect you? The\nfinal deficient need is esteem.\nMaslow divides esteem needs\ninto two categories, esteem\nfor oneself and the desire for reputation\nor respect from others in your life.\nEsteem for oneself can\ninclude often feeling a sense\nof achievement, being\nindependent, mastering a skill\nand high self-esteem your\nconfidence in yourself.\nThe desire for reputation\nor respect from others can\ninvolve your status or prestige.\nSatisfying your esteem tier\ncan mean not only respect from\nothers, but more importantly,\nrespect for yourself.\nThough you've mastered\nthe four lower tiers,\nremember Maslow urges us that\nthose four tiers do not need\nto be satisfied 100%.\nSo you feel confident\nand satisfied enough in\nthose four tiers, so much so\nthat your mind begins to\nwander somewhere else.\nYour motivation to focus on\nyourself has become stronger.\nYou look inwards and discover\nsomething new about yourself.\nThis is where you begin\nto realize your potential.\nAll other needs in your life are tamed.\nYou seek self-fulfillment, memorable\n- Experiences, personal growth.\nYou strive to be the best you can be.\nAnd now that you've\nsatisfied your other needs,\nyou are now motivated more than ever\nto become your best inner self.\nWhat can you accomplish?\nWhen one has reached this\ntier, they will often attend\nto their specific passions or desires.\nTheir thoughts are now\nwandering to the things\nthat truly reflect them,\nthe things they care about personally.\nOn a deeper level, perhaps you strive\nto make a life-changing\nscientific discovery.\nMaybe your heart turns\nto raising humans with the inner beauty.\nYou strive for an ideal guardian, parent,\ncaretaker, or teacher.\nMaybe you're focused on\nbecoming not only financially\nstable, but successful as well, proud\nof the wealth and growth around you.\nOr perhaps your heart lies with the arts.\nRealizing your creativity,\nyou turn to your music,\nyour writing, your paintings, inventions\nthat can change the world\nor stir emotions in the hearts\nof those who experience them.\nMaybe you ask yourself,\nwhat is the meaning of life?\nPerhaps your motivation has been lost\nand you ponder what it is\nyou need, who it is you are,\nwhat will satisfy your aching heart?\nAnd you'll realize everyone's\nanswer to that question.\nWe so often ask is different.\nAfter all, it's the meaning\nyou put to your life, perhaps\nto motivate you to find it.\nYou need to satisfy your body\nand mind's fundamental needs first,\nand then you may find your\nmind turning to what it is\nthat is secretly in your\nheart, the potential\nthat lies there to come\nface to face with exactly\nwho you are all along,\nand to see that you are\nquite satisfied with them.\nThanks so much for watching.\nWhich tier do you hope to\nsatisfy to become more motivated\nto achieve self-actualization?\nCan you tell which tier\nyou're currently in?\nFeel free to share\nwith us your wandering\nthoughts in the comments below.\nWhat is the meaning of\nlife?
