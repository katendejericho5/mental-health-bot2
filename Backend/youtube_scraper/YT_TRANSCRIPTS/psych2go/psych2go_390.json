    "transcript": "hey seor and welcome back to another\nvideo before we start we'd like to give\nyou a huge thanks for all of the love\nand support that you've given us pyo's\nmission is to make psychology more\naccessible to everyone and you help us\ndo that now let's continue whether you\nhave experienced physical abuse an\nunstable family or a toxic environment\ntrauma has a way of shaking up our world\nwhich may leave us with lasting pain but\nunlike physical wounds that are visible\nthe Mental effects of trauma are not\nalways obvious so today we want to\nexplore the different ways that trauma\naffects the brain amydala A wise man\nonce said it's not the size that matters\nit's how you use it and that's certainly\nthe case for the amigdala despite its\nsize this small almond-shaped structure\nplays a huge role in the brain in\nparticular it regulates our emotional\nresponses which include fear anxiety and\nsadness and when functioning properly it\nacts as the brain's alarm system but\nwhat happens in the amydala of someone\nwith trauma while in most cases of PTSD\nthe amydala undergos hyperactivity a\n2014 study published in Social\nNeuroscience Journal found an\ninteresting New Perspective in this\nstudy the researchers examined the\nresponse of 42 firsttime mothers and how\nthey reacted to the happy and sad faces\nof their infants in the mothers who had\nunresolved trauma their amydala\nactivated less than mothers who didn't\nsuffer from trauma they believed this to\nbe an indication of the mother's\ndisengagement from their infants and\nthat can be linked to disrupted maternal\ncaregiving while this doesn't mean that\nmothers with trauma lack care about\ntheir infants it can mean that trauma\nmay affect our amydala which can make us\nless responsive to others distress\nhippocampus a major part of our brain\nthe hippocampus plays an important role\nin learning and memory if it does its\njob well the hippocampus helps you learn\nthe formulas for that upcoming math test\nor remember your way through a complex\nmaze but it turns out the trauma also\nhas very very serious effect on the\nhippoc campus in February 2006 a coal\nmine gas explosion occurred in the\nshanki province of China which left the\nsurviving coal miners with PTSD 7 years\nlater 24 of the 30 survivors with PTSD\nwere recruited to undergo an fmri along\nwith 25 coal miners without PTSD the\nstudy was later published by the public\nlibrary of science with striking\nfindings researchers found that the coal\nminers with PTSD had a smaller\nhippocampus than the control group since\na smaller hippocampus is associated with\nAlzheimer's disease depression and\nstress you can say that these mental\ndisorders may be linked to trauma\nprefrontal cortex if the amydala is the\nbrain's alarm system the prefrontal\ncortex decides how to react to the\nsignals sent by the amydala when in\ndistress the amydala sends a signal of\nthreat or stress in the environment\nwhile the prefrontal cortex assesses the\nsituation and tries to make it feel less\nscary they work together to keep us safe\nand out of danger while helping us to\ndifferentiate between real danger or a\nfalse alarm but of course trauma has a\nway of disrupting this delicate system a\n2006 paper by Dr James Douglas Bremer\nwrites that patients with PTSD showed\nsigns of smaller hippocampus hyperactive\namydala and decreased prefrontal cortex\nactivity simply put a brain under trauma\nirregularly sends distress signals while\nyour judgment system isn't able to tell\nif it's a real danger or not this could\nmean that people with trauma could be\nunder stress while having a hard time\njudging if the situation is actually\ndangerous or not so what can we do\ntrauma is a serious mental condition and\nshould not be taken lightly but how can\nwe address it an article by Frontiers in\nbehavioral Neuroscience strongly\nrecommends that you should seek the help\nof trauma focused Healthcare\nprofessionals if you suspect that you're\nsuffering from trauma this means that\nthe therapy should directly address\nmemories or thoughts related to the\ntraumatic event these types of therapy\nare prolonged exposure therapy cognitive\nprocessing therapy and Trauma focused\ncognitive behavioral therapy each of\nthese types of therapy have been shown\nto be effective when working with trauma\npatients because they deal directly with\nthe traumatic event with the right\ntreatment and resources we can overcome\nthe negative effect of trauma to lead a\nhappy healthier life so don't give up we\nhope that the information provided in\nthis video will encourage you to seek\nhelp and that you'll find the resources\nyou need to help you\nrecover here's the next chapter
