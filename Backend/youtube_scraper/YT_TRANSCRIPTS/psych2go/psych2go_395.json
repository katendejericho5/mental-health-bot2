    "transcript": "[Music]\nhas anyone ever told you you were too\nnice for your own good do you often feel\nlike being too much of a people pleaser\nhas a negative impact on your life\nwhile it's easy to beat ourselves up for\nthe way we let people treat us\npsychologists have actually discovered\nthat being this way having a fond\nresponse as they call it is one of the\nways we adapt to perceived threats and\nif\noh\nto be more specific it was therapist\nPete Walker who first studied and wrote\nabout this phenomenon in his book\ncomplex PTSD from surviving to thriving\nWalker who specializes in cases of cptsd\ndefines fawning as a maladaptive way of\ncreating safety in our interpersonal\nrelationships by essentially mirroring\nthe imagined expectations needs and\ndesires of others this happens when our\nsympathetic nervous system becomes\nactivated due to some perceived threat\nin our environment\nour bodies will then go into either\nfight flight freeze or Fawn mode and\nwhen someone experiences something\ntraumatic early on in their life it can\nkeep them stuck in one of these four\nmodes so basically fawning is a\nmaladaptive response to extreme\npsychological stress\nwith that said here are seven telltale\nsigns according to experts that your\nproblem with being too nice just might\nactually be fawning a manifestation of\nyour trauma\nnumber one you don't feel seen if you're\nsomeone who's prone to fawning you're\nprobably the go-to person for a lot of\npeople whenever they need a favor or\nwant some help with something this is\nbecause according to self-help expert\nPhoebe prep when we Fawn we disregard\nour own wants and needs and decide in\nthat moment that the one thing that's\nimportant is giving the other person\nwhat they want and need and by being too\nmuch of a giver you end up struggling to\nfeel seen by others for who you are as a\nperson and not just what you can do for\nthem\nnumber two your values become\ncompromised one of the reasons why\nfawning as a trauma response can impact\nus so negatively is because it erodes\nour sense of self according to an\narticle by the dawn Wellness Center in\nrehab people fond to avoid conflict and\nTrauma by over-appusing people but this\ncan lead them to compromise their values\na lot of the time people who are like\nthis often find it difficult to stand up\nfor themselves and what they believe in\nand instead validate behaviors attitudes\nor views that they don't even agree with\nnumber three you feel responsible for\nother people's reactions\nanother important Point brought up by\nthe dawn Wellness Center in rehab in the\narticle mentioned earlier was the\nfawning types tend to feel a misplaced\nsense of guilt and responsibility over\nother people's feelings and reactions in\nfact they're usually more invested in\nthe happiness comfort and validation of\nother people than they are in their own\nthis can manifest as strong feelings of\nguilt self-blame and self-loathing over\nthe negative reactions of others towards\nthings that aren't even their fault or\nin their control\nnumber four you're terrified of making\ndecisions for others\nsimilar to our earlier Point fawning is\na trauma response can make us terrified\nof choosing things for other people even\nsomething is inconsequential is where to\neat dinner or recommending a show to\nsomeone can leave us reeling from\nintense dread and panic wondering oh no\nwhat if they hate it\nwhy\nwell according to an article by\nPsychology today this is because your\nconstant need to please others and\nalways looking to them for how you\nshould feel makes you doubt or disregard\nyour own feelings and experiences number\nfive you feel guilty about getting them\nangry according to the mental health\nexperts at Kiran trauma clinics people\nwho tend to Fawn as a trauma response\ncommonly experience deep feelings of\nguilt towards themselves because of it\nthey don't allow themselves to get angry\nat others who are taking advantage of\nthem or disrespecting their boundaries\nevery time they even try to speak up\nabout it they feel immensely guilty and\ninstead end up enabling and excusing the\nbad behaviors and mistreatment of others\nnumber six you over apologize\nmuch like our earlier Point fawning as a\ndrama response often results in a lack\nof personal boundaries low self-esteem\nand loss of personal agency and autonomy\nin the most common manifestation of all\nof these over apologizing this is\nbecause fawning often stems from\nrejection trauma so in order to avoid\nbeing rejected by others we learn to\ntake the blame for everything and just\napologize to keep the peace and number\nseven you don't know how to say no\nlast but certainly not least not knowing\nhow to say no to people is arguably the\nmost telling sign of all that being too\nnice isn't your problem\nit's your trauma response bonding and\naccording to an article from sex Central\nfun types are almost always stretched\ntoo thin they're so eager to please\nother people that they say yes to\neverything no matter how inconvenient or\ntiresome\nthe worst part however is that they\noverwork themselves not because they\njust genuinely have so much love energy\nand patience to give but because they\nfear that the moment they say no others\nwill immediately turn on them\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here did learning about\nall these signs make you realize you\nmight be fawning as a result of some\nunresolved trauma\nwhile we might think that fawning and\npeople-pleasing is the ideal way of\nbuilding relationships with others\nthese connections will ultimately be\ndraining inauthentic and unfulfilling\nfor us because it doesn't allow us to\nhave our own sense of identity or\nvalidate our own feelings and\nexperiences so if you are seriously\nstruggling with recovery from trauma\nplease don't hesitate to reach out to a\nmental health care professional today\nand seek help and to quote self-help\nGuru Phoebe parib being a nice person\nmeans making your own wants and needs\nbut also listening to what other people\nwant and need and finding a middle\nground this is exercising kind\ncommunication unlike fawning which is\nnever asserting our own wants and needs\nkindness is not equivalent to being a\ndoormat erasing your sense of self or\nnever speaking up for yourself\nare you looking for a cuddly companion\nthat brings positivity and mental\nWellness to your daily life get your\nvery own side The Lovable plushie is\nhere to
