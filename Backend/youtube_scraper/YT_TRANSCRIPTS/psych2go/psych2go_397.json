    "transcript": "hello psych too viewers I'm Michelle\nRivas host of psychology Roundtable on\nsite to go our guest for today's live\nstream is April Simkins Ambassador and\nadvocate for the National Alliance on\nMental Illness also known as Nami April\nis also the mother of 2019s missusa\nChesley Chris who tragically passed away\nfrom suicide in January of\n2022 April's Fierce advocacy is changing\nthe lives of so many people by spreading\nthe importance of mental health\nawareness and suicide prevention thank\nyou for joining us today April it means\nso much to us thank you for having me\ntruly absolutely so can you tell our\nviewers a little bit about yourself and\nyour background sure um I have been\nactually in human resources for close to\n30 years and even now um I'm a Chief\nHuman Resources officer for a National\nOrganization um and I love it um\nmy job requires me actually to go out\nand speak and so being the outward face\nof our organization is part of my\nresponsibility I have h a speaking\ncareer that spans about 15 years W um I\nwork with two speakers agents and I\ntypically talk on topics like um cor\ncorporate culture diversity Equity\ninclusion leadership and I've always\nshared about mental health that's\nextremely important we need diversity in\nHR for\nsure and and so you know because of the\nseat in which I sit I owned my own\nConsulting practice actually for about\n18 years until I sold that company um\nand so worked with literally over a\nthousand organizations in 15 different\nIndustries and had a chance to hear from\nbusiness owners but also from their\nteams and so being being able to really\ntalk about what's impacting workers\nbecame my passion and of course after um\nChesley passed my focus shifted a little\nbit more to talking about mental health\nand its\nintersectionality with culture diversity\nEquity inclusion uh and Leadership\nabsolutely and you can't talk about\nmental health without taking into\naccount different like factors such as\nrace or socioeconomic background so\nthank you for that Absolut your story\nthank you and your story is incredibly\ninspiring you've demonstrated so much\nstrength and Grace in the face of losing\nyour daughter cheslie to Suicide more\nthan a year ago can you tell our\naudience who cheslie was in a bit about\nher background um chese was absolutely\nan\namazing amazing woman and sometimes it's\nstill hard for me to talk about her in\npast tense so there are times when I\nwill talk about her in presents present\ntense because she is always with me um\nshe's an incredible just an incredible\nindividual to have met her uh is to love\nher she was from a very very young age\nacademically gifted and she took that\nwith her all the way into adulthood she\nwas also uh an amazing athlete a\nmusician she was a philanthropist she um\nEd her\ncommunity um you know many people know\nher list of accomplishments which\nincludes graduating cuml from what was\nthen the number one Honors College in\nthe country at the University of South\nCarolina and the more School of Business\nshe got her jurist doctor and her MBA\nsimultaneously from Wake Forest\nUniversity and then went on to practice\nlaw uh complex civil litigation licensed\nto to practice law in two states um she\ncompeted in several beauty pageants and\nof course went on to when the title of\nmissusa in\n2019 and after that became an extra TV\nnews\ncorrespondant um she was amazingly smart\nbut incredibly\nhumble um just an incredible athlete she\nstill has records um at the University\nof South Carolina in the triple jump she\nwas outspoken but she was\nintroverted\num she was you know she had a solid\nathlete physique but there was still\nsomething very beautiful and feminine\nabout her um she just honestly she just\nencompassed so many amazing things yeah\nshe literally had the most beautiful\nhair like just hair\ngoals funny thing about cheslie is she\nwas actually born bald um did not have\nmuch hair at all I remember vividly\nhaving to um like gather up a few\nstrands of her hair and I wrapped some\nScotch tape around it and then I would\nlike Snap the\n[Laughter]\nbaret so yeah and then her hair started\ngrowing and just kept growing absolutely\nshe\nbloomed yes beautiful thank you for\ntelling us about her because she truly\nwasn't incredible and amazing woman so\nthank you and then um you know cheslie\nwas known to be extremely bubbly and\nradiant there was truly a glow about her\nlike people could see that on screen and\nnot just because of her physical Beauty\nbut like you mentioned because of her\nbeautiful personality and so many people\nwere shocked when the news of her\npassing emerge for our for our viewers\ncan you explain what high functioning\ndepression is and how it can be\ndifficult to De to detect in someone yes\num very difficult to detect and you you\nknow there's some nuances around the use\nof that phrase high functioning\ndepression because there are many people\nwho um are battling depression who still\nshow up for events and still show up for\ntheir life but the difference with high\nfunctioning\ndepression is that it's persistent and\nit has actually sometimes referred to as\npersistent depressive disorder it's just\nalways there it doesn't really have um a\nlot of of the EB and flow like a chronic\ndepression and so because someone with\nhigh functioning depression has learned\nto live in that state it is very\ndifficult to detect um if there is some\nkind of major depression because they do\nappear to be coping very well but that\nis\nunfortunately that um ability to not be\ndetected is part of that level of\ndepression or that typ type of\ndepression um you know you won't see it\nyou likely won't see it um or be able to\ndetect it there's many reasons why\npeople with the you know the spectrum of\ndepression may not share it with someone\nand choose to keep it to themselves um\nhigh functioning depression because it\ndoesn't wear what we consider to be\nmarkers of depression we just assume\nthat person is perfectly fine and\nperfectly\nwhen in actuality they may not be\nexactly thank you for explaining that um\nperfectly Chesley like so many others\nstruggling with high functioning\ndepression feel like they have to put on\na mask often for like the world to see\nand they're unable to be vulnerable\nabout what they're going through due to\nvarious reasons like you mentioned such\nas Society or cultural expectations or\neven the stigma that's attached to\nseeking mental health treatment so how\ndo we fight that stigma so that more\npeople feel comfortable about seeking\nhelp um you know um I love that you\nworded it that way one one distinction I\nwant to make about um\nChesley is there were some people who\nknew she was struggling it just wasn't\npublicly known it was not part of how\nshe branded herself um for a number of\nreasons if I you know rely solely on the\nwords she left behind she didn't want to\nburden some one with how she felt and\nthat is very common with people who um\neither have depressive disorders or are\nbattling high functioning depression\nthey feel like it's a burden for them\nand they don't want to burden someone\nelse is kind of how they view it um you\nknow there I think the way that we can\nbegin to address that and help others to\nfeel a little more comfortable is\ntwofold one we can't change others but\nwe can change ourself and there's so\nmuch power in just being\nkind and kindness for someone who is\nbattling gives this measure of Grace\nthat makes it a little easier to not be\nokay when we extend a measure of\nkindness and\nsecondly learn to be truthful ourselves\nyou know we look at people who may be\nbattling a mental illness and put the\nresponsibility in bonus on them to step\nforward and say I'm struggling when we\num those of us who may not be struggling\nin that way aren't honest with how we're\nfeeling how many times do people say to\nyou hey how are you doing and you say\nfine when you know you're not fine or\nyou know you're not or something's on\nyour mind so I think we all need to take\nthat lesson in our own advice and be\ntransparent with how we're feeling and\nit makes it easier for those who are\nstruggling to also be forthcoming\nexactly beautifully put thank you for\nthat April and it's true a lot of people\nthat's stigma around it not just because\npeople feel like they might be a burden\nbut because of that horrible label of\nyou know sometimes people will label\nsomeone crazy because they mention that\nthey have depression or anxiety and\nthat's extremely damaging and so that's\nsomething that we need to it's a\nsocietal problem would you agree yes I\nwould it comes from you know just lack\nof of understanding one um you know one\nthing I've learned and talked about as\nan Nami Ambassador is that mental\nillness extends far beyond anxiety and\ndepression and anxiety and depression is\nsomething that's more common we feel\nthat um but you know mental illness\nextends to those who are battling\nbipolar disorder\nPTSD um OCD Eating Disorders it just\nextends Beyond just those things and\nthere's so much we don't know we can't\nunderstand we are then Rel lying on that\none individual to explain how they're\nfeeling and there's a spectrum and so it\nis easier for our brains to just say\nthis is bad this is wrong I don't have\nto process this when really we just need\nto give people space to just kind of be\nwhere they are and how they're feeling\nand the more we just give them space to\ndo that the more we're going to break\nthat stigma it's okay to have a bad day\nit's okay to not be okay and we need to\nmake that normal exactly definitely and\nyou know another thing you may not\nunderstand it but you can always\napproach it with empathy there's no\nexcuse to La lack empathy when it comes\nto these situations even if you don't\nunderstand why the person's acting the\nway they are 100% And you know I see\nthat happening in our everyday lives I\nsee it happening to people celebrities\non TV especially you know we'll see\nsomeone I you know we've all witnessed\nthis the cameras will pan in on someone\nwho isn't smiling or looking gleeful and\nthen we've hit them with the barrage of\nhow unappreciative they are of who who\nthey are and their status\nor and maybe they're just not okay in\nthat moment and that is where kindness\nand Grace comes into play absolutely you\ndon't know what's going on behind closed\ndoors thank you and I wanted to know\nApril how did you transform your pain\ninto Power despite dealing with such\nenormous grief how did you find the\nstrength to become an advocate for\nothers it was a hard honestly um living\nwith grief is the hardest thing I've\never had to do in my life\nand I\nremember you know not long ago I think\nit's kind of during Co when there was a\nwoman who was on a talent show and she\nwas battling cancer and she was dying\nfrom\ncancer and she sing this beautiful song\nabout being okay even though clearly she\nwas in a state of Decline and she said\nsomething I thought was really profound\nand she said you know life is never\ngoing to be perfect it is it's just not\nit's not designed to be that way we have\nto learn how to live in the\nimperfection and I feel like that is\nalmost a a motto for me I have to just\nlearn to\nlive in this place of partnering with\ngrief it just doesn't leave me there are\nmoments when I feel like I could you\nknow Take On The World and then there\nare moments when I'm just I can't climb\nout of bed and I've learned to accept\nthat that is the way life is going to be\nbut it will not stop me from\nliving amazing that's so powerful and it\nis so true like grief depression those\nthings EB and flow it's not something\nthat just goes away like some magical\ncure pill or anything like that like\nit's learning to understand that this is\na part of life and you know how do I\ncope how do I deal but also there's\ngoing to be happy moments too it's not\nalways going to be this way yeah 100%\nAnd um you know I I saw this meme not\ntoo long ago that I thought was\nabsolutely brilliant and it said we are\nnot a machine and it showed all the\ndifferent places on a scale where your\nbest could land and today my best might\njust be getting out of bed and getting\ndressed and coming down and responding\nto a few emails and tomorrow my best\nmight be stepping on a stage in front of\nthousands of people to deliver a keynote\naddress I've accepted that my best isn't\ngoing to look the same every single day\nand that's okay that is the part of\nlearning how to be in the space of not\nbeing okay exactly that that's so\npowerful that is so true sometimes I\nfeel that way like I only have the\nenergy to get up and brush my hair and\nbrush my teeth and that's it like it's\njust a bad day and then the next day I'm\nhere doing an interview with an\nincredible person like\nyou and you know honestly um Michelle\nwhen we let our best kind of EB and flow\nwe stop comparing ing every single day\nto our best day um that's just you know\nit's just not attainable because there's\nso many life factors that play into how\nwe're feeling at that moment or that day\nand so just accept I'm going to do my\nbest today and your best may look\ndifferent today than it did yesterday\nthan it will tomorrow exactly and\ncomparing yourself to others and you\nknow that's that's poisonous so yes yes\n100% comparison really is the thief of\nJoy um just have to live your\nlife thank you for that and then so I\nwas going to ask what are some coping\nStrate strategies that you that you've\num developed that that have helped you\nmanage\ngrief one of the hardest that I've\nreally had to work with my counselor on\nis learning to just feel what I feel um\nand that I think was most difficult um\nas a mom I have six children um I'm\nmarried I have my own um small business\non the side I work a day job it's very\neasy for me to learn how to kind of tuck\nmy own feelings and emotions away put\nthem to the side because I got to focus\non something else or my children need\nsomething or um I've got to deliver on a\ndeadline um and so that became almost\nthe coping mechanism to not feel what I\nfeel and to allow myself to\ncompartmentalize and put that on a shelf\nfor moment but now I've changed that\nscript and I allow myself to feel what I\nfeel if I'm feeling happy I will go fall\nlaugh I will laugh till I cry and it\nfeels so good and in those moments when\nI am just stricken with grief of missing\nChesley desperately um I allow myself to\nfeel that I weep I cry I you know I talk\nto my husband and all of that's kind of\nkind of new for me so um I think one of\nthe things I've learned to do is feel\nwhat I feel um another thing that I've\nlearned to do is practicing\nself-care um which is something else\nthat it's not that I didn't practice\nself-care but I've learned now to do it\nwithout the feeling of\nguilt yes just do for me and it's okay\nto do for me um exercising boundaries\nlearning to say no and be okay with it\nnot feel like I have to apologize or\nexplain um making sure that I continue\nto see my counsel\nfocusing on getting sleep I mean so many\nthings that I've done ancillary that\njust help take care of me um I've looked\nin so many areas where you can just\nsupport your brain and your your um\nmental health in general like getting\ngood sleep like exactly good nutrition\nmoving your body all of those things\nhelp as well exactly and that is so\nimportant and you mentioned something\nreally vital which is you shouldn't feel\nfeel guilt for you know ex practicing\nself-care right why do you think so many\npeople feel guilt around that like just\nfor getting the sleep that they need or\nfor doing things for themselves you know\nI I I can't speak for everyone I know\nthat I felt guilt with self-care um\nbecause I always felt like that's\nsomething that I should be I should be\ndoing something for someone else you\nknow I need to be doing blank for one of\nmy children or you know just to sit\nstill at would self-care sometimes does\nlook like relaxing\nand relaxing when I know there's laundry\nthat needs to be done or there's dishes\nthat it's just really is hard to do that\num or just get up and go for a walk when\nI know that you know there's some\nvacuuming that needs to be done but I've\nhad to learn to stop doing that I think\nalso especially and I bring this up a\nlot as moms we get judged so much um you\nknow you're you can do so much for your\nchildren um and then Society will label\nyou as living through your children and\nthen if you back off and do for you you\nget labeled as a bad mom who was\nneglecting your children and so there's\nthat pull and push um happens in the\nworkplace you know we work work work and\nbecome Workaholics and that's frowned on\nbut then if you take long vacations\npeople just assume that you've got a\nluxury job because you can you know go\ntake a vacation and so I think that that\nadds to guilt we may feel for self-care\nbut you have to do it anyway and\nlearning to that without guilt that was\na that's a process it's a part of the\nhealing process too right it really is\nyeah thank you and now we're going to\nswitch over to our audience segment\nwhere we answer your viewer questions\nI'm really excited and so the first one\nis from Sam uh Sam asked I'm struggling\nwith anxiety and depression and I'm\nafraid to tell my parents that I'm\nseeking treatment out of fear of them\njudging me or labeling me crazy how\nshould I go about this April M there's a\nfew things that I would say sam um first\nif you're not already working with a\ncounselor work with the counselor um\nbecause they can help give you the words\nyou need based on the language you use\nwith your parents um or those close to\nyou to make it safe um second decide\nbeforehand how much you want to share I\ncan say as a parent sometimes it is\nscary when you um see your child\nstruggling with something that you don't\nfeel you can help them with and so it\ndoes become easier as a parent to put up\nthese defenses um of not understanding\nso determine on the front side if you\ndon't feel it's 100% safe determine what\nyou're going to share um and let that be\na longer term process don't feel like\nyou have to share everything all at\nonce thank you for that and then um the\nnext question is from Jenny she asked\nApril uh you mentioned the intersection\nbetween race and mental health Health\nhow can we support more African-American\nwomen with their mental\nhealth you know a great question it\nreally is a great question and I've\ntalked a lot about this actually um this\nintersectionality of mental health and\nthe black community especially as black\nwomen um it is hard if you look at the\nracial structure um Even in our country\num you know there's an\nimbalance that black people will feel\nand then black women being a double\nminority coming right out of the shoot\nmakes it even harder and so there is\nthis need to um to show more strength\nand unfortunately we can be our worst\nenemy and trying to mask that or being\nfearful of accepting help um because of\nthe stigma that may come along um of\nfeeling like you're not as strong or\nyou're weak or you need help and I can\nalso tell you um religion and faith is\nso permeated through the black community\nthat you know you're sometimes made to\nfeel like if you have a mental illness\nor a mental health challenge that you're\nnot spiritual enough or you're not\nprayed up enough or there's something\nwrong with your connection and so it's\neasy to hide I would say that the best\nway you can help black women is to exude\nGrace dignity and empathy and the more\nyou do that the easier it is to just be\nin the space that we're in without\nhaving to to feel um like we need to put\non a\nmask thank you for that April and then\nour next question is from Briana she\nasked uh April do you think that mental\nhealth classes should be mandatory in\nhigh schools and colleges what do you\nthink about that should it be a new\npolicy um I don't know know that we\nshould um make mental health classes\nmandatory I do think that mental health\neducation should be incorporated into\nevery subject it should become its own\nfilter um secondly I would say getting\nmental health certified me um mental\nhealth first aid certified should be\nsomething that we were re we require of\nsome students um student athletes I\nthink is great um there may be other\nstudent organizations that want to adopt\nthat as a criteria I got my mental\nhealth first aid certification this year\nalong with my emotional CPR\ncertification and they became game\nchangers for me someone who's talked\nabout mental health for decades um it\nreally helps you understand not just the\nspectrum of Mental Illness but how to\napproach someone how to talk to someone\nand most importantly how to listen to\nsomeone so I think that's really really\nimportant it's not that I'm opposed to\nteaching mental health I think we have\nto be careful with who is teaching that\nand do we have the budget to put that\nlevel of professional on staff and our\nschool\nsystems thank you and then um so we got\na question from Eli he asked April I\nrecently lost a loved one to cancer a\nfew months ago how do I make my friends\nand loved ones understand that I'm just\nnot in the mood to go out clubbing or to\nyou know make myself available to them\nfirst of all I'm so sorry to hear\nthat um declaring your space is really\nimportant and the expectation sometimes\nthat people will understand um is\ndifficult I'm sure I shouldn't say I'm\nsure but my guess is that um they are\ntrying in their own way to help you and\nmaybe don't realize that you're not\nready for that kind of help that you\nwill ask or you will speak out when you\nare ready to reenter who you maybe were\num at another point in your life and if\nyou are permanently changed like I tell\npeople I'm not the April that I was\nbefore my daughter passed I'm learning\nthis new April because I'm living with a\ndifferent kind of pain um I have been\nvery clear with where my boundaries are\nthe things that I cannot handle um I'm\nvery clear with a no and taught them to\nrespect my\nno thank you and then our next question\nis from Joel Demetrius Johnson what is\nthe most important thing to tell people\nwho are new to their diagnosis of\ndepression this is such an amazing\nquestion because a lot of people who are\nnewly diagnosed it's so fresh to them\nand it could be very like upsetting at\nfirst they don't really know what to do\nabout it so what's your that April um I\nwould say first of all You're Not\nAlone um that there is lots of help and\nthere is a community of support\navailable connect with that Community\nthere's something about depression and I\ncan tell you that I um struggled with\ndepression before Chesley passed and it\ncompounded itself after she passed and\nthen got mixed with PTSD and other\nthings that I've had to learn now to\nlive with and being in a community where\npeople\nunderstand um the language you will now\nuse or the feelings that you will try to\ndescribe is so important I talk about\nNami a lot Nami is a National\nOrganization and the one great thing\nabout Nami is they have physical\nlocations over a thousand all throughout\nthe country you can visit them at\nnami.org\nand find a location near you they do\npeer-to-peer counseling familyto\ncounseling because the diagnosis of\nmental illness impacts the entire family\nand I love that they have that\npeer-to-peer so we can all talk about\nhow we're feeling around that diagnosis\nso that is the one thing I would say is\nfind your\ncommunity thank you for that I agree you\nhave you have to have a support system\nhow has a support system helped you you\nApril oh tremendously um my circle got\nreal tight after um cheslie passed\nbecause I needed people who would give\nme space to not be okay um and and those\npeople who I've kept closest to me give\nme they give me that space and so that's\ngreat I've learned to say no um I am a\nnational uh speaker and I as a matter of\nfact I just finished about a 10day\nstretch of speaking on the road from a\nclass at Harvard University to the\nNational Conference of state legislators\nand others um and it can be sometimes\ndraining and so I'm I'm very I've\nlearned to speak up for myself and say\nno I'm not going to be able to join you\nfor dinner I need to go back to my room\nand just decompressed and be alone for a\nlittle bit and I'm perfectly fine to say\nthat and just go and be by myself um so\nhaving a circle has helped but also\nlearning speak for myself as help it's\ncalled yeah it's called Boundaries right\njust you know yes yeah and anyone who\nviolates your boundaries shouldn't being\nyour life right like you know absolutely\nand you know I'm glad that you said that\nand another thing that I will share um\nbecause family's hard um it's difficult\nand we want our families to understand\nand we want our close friends understand\nsometimes they just won't understand and\nthat's why connecting with people who\nunderstand is so important you don't\nhave to to eliminate um those people\nfrom your circle but where you are now\nis going to require a different kind of\nsupport and so that's why I say reach\nout into a community of people who\nunderstand include yes 100 per. well\nthat concludes our audience segment so\nnow I just wanted to ask you April what\nare your next projects with nami and\nlike what are you doing next with your\nmental health initiatives thank you so\nmuch for asking um we're getting ready\nto start a podcast it'll tip off at the\nfirst the year um we're really going to\nbroaden the conversations around mental\nhealth um as I mentioned I'm in Human\nResources have been for about 30 years\nso they're going to focus a little bit\nmore on managing mental health in the\nworkplace um but also how we manage\nmental health outside of work and in our\nin our regular lives so I'm looking\nforward to kicking that off next year\nI've got some other cool projects that\nyou'll hear more about uh in the middle\nof the Year aside from now that I'm\ngoing to continue stepping into big\nspaces to open up conversations about\nmental health that's amazing are you\ngoing to be at the Miss Universe Pageant\nthis upcoming year I you know I'm not\nplanning to right now but that can\nalways change I absolutely adore every\nsingle person at the Miss

larger group\nof children\nnow love on and so um I don't know that\nI'll I don't know that I'll be there\nthis year um but they are very very\nclose and near and dear to my heart oh\nthat's amazing
