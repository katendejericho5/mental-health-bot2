with Rue\nand Jules\nthey bonded over their demons ready to\nbe saved by each other but in reality\ntheir relationship was led by emotional\ndependency jealousy and a lack of\nhealthy communication

out\nof their control everyone and everything\nis against them and their problems\ncannot be solved even if they try so\nhard they often say things like I wish\nsomeone would care about me or why does\nthis happen to me this role is also\ncalled a victim mentality marriage and\nfamily therapist Daniel danshaw wrote\nthat people with this mindset use\npassive aggressive statements don't take\nresponsibility for their actions and\noften feel lonely and unsupported by\ntheir partner which leads us to The\nRescuer\nthinking you can love your abusive\npartner through the pain thinking you\ncan find the cure for their depression\nbelieving being a better partner will\nsolve all of their problems those are\nall examples of how a rescuer tries to\nsave their victim they are drawn to\nneedy emotionally damaged people and\npartners who would become dependent on\nthem psychologists also coined this term\nrescuer syndrome or the white knight\nsyndrome as clinical psychologist Dr\nMary lehma calls it in her book The\nWhite Knight syndrome rescuing yourself\nfrom your need to rescue others that's\nwhen The Rescuer is convinced they can\nfix their broken partner and heal them\nbut this belief ultimately harms them\nclinical psychologist Karen Nimo said on\nmedium that constantly feeling the need\nto help their partner could make them\nover invest and push their own needs\naside\nup next is the persecutor finally\nthere's the persecutor with their famous\nline it's all your fault\npersecutor is controlling angry and\noverly critical\nthey might blame you for even
