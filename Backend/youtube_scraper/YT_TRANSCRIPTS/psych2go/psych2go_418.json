    "transcript": "[Music]\nif you clicked on this video chances are\nyou're grappling with a nagging concern\nhave you become too attached to someone\nalthough attachment plays an important\nrole in our ability to connect with\nothers it's important to understand that\nit's not the same as love clinical\npsychologist Dr Alexander dragi defines\nemotional attachment as a feeling of\ncloseness that helps sustain\nrelationships over time and if your\nattachment is healthy and meaningful it\nwill gradually become love there is\nhowever a thin line between healthy and\nunhealthy emotional attachment and being\ntoo attached to someone certainly falls\nin the ladder says clinical social\nworker Sasha Jackson with that said here\nare six psychology backed warning signs\nthat you're overly attached to someone\nover idealizing do you often fantasize\nabout a future together after just\nmeeting them or find yourself\nromanticizing everything they do this\nbehavior is is known as idealization and\naccording to clinical psychologist Dr\ncrystalin Salter's pedol it's a\nmaladaptive way of coping with an\nanxious or unhealthy attachment toward\nsomeone this is problematic because not\nonly are you burdening this person with\nunrealistic expectations they can't\npossibly live up to you may also be\nignoring or excusing their red flags and\nchoosing to only see what you want to\nsee avoiding being alone another\nTelltale sign of over attachment is the\ntendency to seek out relation ships just\nto avoid being alone says clinical\nsocial worker Sasha Jackson so if you\noften jump from one partner to another\nbecause you don't know how to be single\nit's an indication of a red flag that\nwarrants attention because this\nincreases the likelihood of you staying\nin unfulfilling or unhealthy\nrelationships simply out of a fear of\nAbandonment and a need for external\nvalidation which brings us to our next\nPoint constant\nvalidation relying on another person for\ntheir approval and needing their\nconstant reassurance is considered a\nmanifestation of unhealthy over\nattachment according to therapist Dr\nJennifer litner and mental health\njournalist Crystal raple seeking\nconstant validation and defining your\nself-worth solely through your\nrelationship can be detrimental as it\ncan erode your self-esteem make you\nsusceptible to manipulation prevent you\nfrom expressing disagreement and leave\nyou emotionally\nunstable weak sense of self rapole and\nDr litner go on to explain how this can\nmanifest as changing one's habits\ninterests behaviors and goals to align\nmore with theirs spending more time with\ntheir friends and family over your own\nabandoning your own boundaries and\npersonal needs for them and committing\nall of your time energy and resources to\nthe relationship inability to function\naccording to psychologist Dr Constantine\nLuken when you're overly attached to\nsomeone you're constantly thinking and\ntalking about them you need to be in\nconstant communication with them because\nyou feel anxious or worried when you're\nnot and when they're not around you you\ndon't know what to do with yourself you\nfeel incomplete without them although it\nmay sound romantic to some taken to an\nextreme it can be destructive to your\nsense of autonomy Independence and\noverall sense of self unbalanced\nDynamics Dr Lucan further explains that\nhaving unbalanced power dynamics in a\nrelationship is a sign of an unhealthy\nemotional attachment because when one\nperson takes much more than they give\nvia time effort consideration or\nattention it can cause problems like\ncodependence and emotional burnout\nexamples of unbalanced Dynamics can\ninclude giving more support than you're\ngetting constantly putting their needs\nbefore your own having to fix their\nproblems for them spending more time\nattending to their emotional needs over\nyour own and not having time for\npersonal interests Hobbies or other\nrelationships anymore so what are your\nthoughts on these signs do you see any\nof them in yourself or resonate with\nwhat we've talked about let us know in\nthe comments below recognizing
