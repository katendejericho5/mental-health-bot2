    "transcript": "[Music]\nhas anyone ever told you it could have\nbeen worse or others have had it worse\nbelieve it or not saying this does not\nhelp or improve things instead it makes\npeople feel guilty for expressing their\nemotions and symptoms of trauma it's\nlike Central States traumatic\ninvalidation can damage your self-worth\nand mental health by convincing you that\nyour feelings and Trauma symptoms are\nunacceptable or unwelcome invalidation\nintentional or not can be severely\ndamaging by negatively affecting your\nunderstanding of yourself and the world\nand making it harder to heal\nbut all trauma no matter how big or\nsmall is valid instead of invalidating\nsomeone's trauma or brushing it off is\nnothing we need to acknowledge and\nvalidate it to create a safe space for\nsomeone to process their emotions and\nbegin the healing process as samsa says\nit best drama has no boundaries\nregarding age gender socioeconomic\nstatus race ethnicity or sexual\norientation so why act like your trauma\nor that anyone else's trauma is any less\nthan valid"
