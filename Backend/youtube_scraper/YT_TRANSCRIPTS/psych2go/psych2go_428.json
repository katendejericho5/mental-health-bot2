soul with\nan extraordinary ability to put smiles\non other people's faces\nbut there's one thing that makes him\nextra special\nhe's a people pleaser extraordinaire\nhe's that yes man who's always willing\nto go the extra mile to make sure his\nfamily significant other and friends are\nhappy even if it means sacrificing\nhimself\nhe's a Sweet Child he always helps me\naround the house despite having no extra\ntime or energy\nI remember there was one time I needed\nsomeone to pick me up from the airport\nearly in the morning he agreed to drive\nfor two hours to the airport despite\nhaving a midterm exam on the same day\nyeah that's how Steven is he bends over\nbackwards for the sake of other people\nhe puts other people's happiness above\nhis own so much so that he sacrifices\nhis own desires and needs\nbut his people-pleasing nature\neventually gets the best of him his\ngirlfriend is a compulsive shopaholic\nwith a high credit card debt so Steven\nsteps in to become her savior\nhe takes on the caretaker role helping\nher pay the debts But as time passes his\ngirlfriend's shopping addiction becomes\nincreasingly severe each time Steven\nfeels like he needs to save her from\nherself and tries to guide her to get\nout of her addiction but he can only do\nso much ultimately he finds it\nfinancially challenging to help his\ngirlfriend now the relationship is\nslipped out of balance and it seems\nStephen is doing more of the heavy\nlifting he's always the one fulfilling\nthe needs of his girlfriend without\nreceiving an equal amount of effort back\nthe relationship with his girlfriend\nmakes him exhausted Steven feels a sense\nof great emptiness and resentment creep\ninside of him he takes on his\ngirlfriend's problems and pain as his\nown at the expense of taking care of\nhimself then it gradually Dawns on him\nthat he has neglected his own needs in\nhis efforts to please other people he\ngoes to see his university counselor to\ndiscuss his dilemma\nsince you've devoted so much time\ntowards making everyone else happy you\nsimply forgot that you also need to make\nyourself happy remember you can't pour\nfrom an empty cup\nit's beautiful to do something for other\npeople but never at the expense of your\nown well-being\nand so from that moment on he embarked\non a journey to improve his well-being\nand learn important lessons on how not\nto let his cup dry out\ntry to figure out the reason why you\nwanted to satisfy other people in the\nfirst place\nhow were your parents treating you when\nyou were a child are they very\ndominating or authoritative\npeople-pleasing is a self-protection\nmechanism you may adopt as a child\nespecially when you wish to steer clear\nof disapproval and conflict\nwhat do you fear will happen if you stop\nhelping your girlfriend paying her\ncredit card debt\nI fear that she will stop loving me\nhelping her helps me feel validated I\nfeel like I have a role in her life I\nwant her to see me as her hero when I\ncan't help her I feel like I'm a failure\nSteven people Pleasers have the\nunderlying belief that who they are is\nnot lovable rather they crave being\nloved in order to feel worthy and happy\nhaving a strong need to be accepted\nunderstood needed and loved leads them\nto be self-effacing and compliant\nthey're overly accommodating to other\npeople's needs so much so that it's hard\nfor them to say no\nyou have to be more authentic and\ncommunicate your difficulties in\nfulfilling their needs\nsomeone who really loves and appreciates\nyou will totally understand it's okay to\nsay no declining to help others when you\nhave your needs to cater to does not\nmake you a bad person it allows you to\nfill your own cup so that you can later\npour it into other people you have to\nassess your priorities too frequently\nyou rush in and say yes without thinking\nit through because you believe your\nresponse is the right one\nthe next time you face a situation you\nmust consciously pause to reflect before\nacting\nthat's okay Stephen I'll ask my sister\nto pick me up instead good luck with\nyour exam buddy\nSteven realizes that he should choose\nthe people that he really wants to\nplease\nthis might be just a few individuals on\na regular basis his significant other\nclose family members and close friends\nhelping those he cherishes will help\ngive him a sense of satisfaction there's\nno point in placing his highest priority\non casual acquaintances people who want\nto take advantage of him or fair weather\nfriends it's all right to help strangers\nfrom time to time if it feels right but\nremember to prioritize your loved ones\nfirst\nsomething truly remarkable unfolds as\nStephen learns to distance himself from\npeople-pleasing behaviors\nclose people in his life praise his\nstrength and his ability to care for\nhimself while at the same time still\nbeing a caring and compassionate person\nhe discovers that finding a balance\nbetween caring for others and honoring\nhis own needs allowed him to form more\nprofound meaningful connections with\npeople the story of Stephen shows us\nwhat it means to recalibrate other\npeople's expectations set boundaries\nassess our priorities in a world that\noften expects us to put others first and\nchoose people that you really want to\nplease\nwe could all learn from Stephen that our\nhappiness matters just as much as the\nhappiness of our loved ones if you found\nthis video helpful don't forget to like\nsubscribe to our Channel and share this\nwith your loved
