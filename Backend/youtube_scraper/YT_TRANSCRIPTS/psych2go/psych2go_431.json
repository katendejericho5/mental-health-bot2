five\npsychology-backed signs that you may be\nquiet but not introverted social\nengagement one of the key\ndifferentiators between quiet\nindividuals and introverts lies in their\npreference for social interactions while\nintroverts often feel rapidly drained by\nprolonged socializing and seek Solitude\nto recharge quiet individuals can be\nquite comfortable in Social settings\nsays Dr susman unlike introverts who\nmight actively avoid large groups or\nexcessive stimulation quiet individuals\ncan tolerate such environments without\nfeeling overwhelmed they may not\nactively initiate or dominate\nconversations but they do frequently\nengage with others in their own way even\nthose they don't know well energy\nrestoration introverts require\nsignificant amounts of alone time
