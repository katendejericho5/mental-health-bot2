    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhy does it seem like you spend most of\nyour time in bed lying down and not\ndoing much lately are you someone who\neasily gets tired and doesn't feel like\ndoing anything do you label this kind of\nbehavior as mere laziness and nothing\nmore there's actually a lot of overlap\nbetween laziness and burnout that can\nmake it difficult to differentiate\nbetween the two\nburnout is a negative state of emotional\nphysical and mental exhaustion caused by\nexcessive stress and inability to cope\nwith it and as of 2010 a survey reported\nthat approximately 75 percent of adults\nin the United States alone have\nexperienced symptoms of burnout with\nover 40 percent of cases being more\nsevere now more than ever it's become\nimperative to educate and better\nunderstand the nature of burnout so with\nthat said here are six telltale signs\nthat what you're experiencing right now\nisn't actually laziness but burnout\nnumber one you feel disconnected from\neverything are you going through the\nmotions of every day as if on autopilot\nis there a persistent feeling of being\ndetached from your own self if you're\nsuffering from burnout one of the things\nyou might be experiencing but don't\nquite realize or understand is\ndepersonalization people experiencing\ndepersonalization most commonly though\nstruggling with trauma report feeling a\nstrange sort of emotional numbness or\nemptiness\nas if they were watching life from\noutside of themselves\nthey don't feel like themselves anymore\nthey don't feel engaged by anything and\nthey constantly struggle with the\noverwhelming sense of helplessness and\ninability to Take Back Control of their\nlives number two you used to be\nmotivated\nlaziness is a character trait and\ncharacter traits tend to remain stable\nover time a lazy person does never feel\nlike exerting effort or applying\nthemselves to things but if you used to\nbe self-motivated and high achieving\noften excelling in certain areas and\nhave only recently become exhausted\napathetic and unmotivated then it's more\nlikely that you're suffering from\nburnout and not laziness like most\npeople would think\nnumber three you used to be passionate a\nclear difference between someone who's\nburnt out and someone who's lazy is that\nthe former used to have things they were\npassionate about but may now be\nstruggling to find interest or enjoyment\nin anymore whether it's a talent a sport\nor just your academic or professional\nperformance in general burnout can make\nit hard for you to do the things you\nonce loved or felt passionate about you\nmight even come to hate or resent it\nbecause of how much you overworked\nyourself and pushed yourself to the\nbrink because of it\nouch\nnumber four you've become Moody and\nirritable do you suddenly find yourself\nSnappy and easily irritated do you often\nfeel emotionally out of control nowadays\nand don't know why moodiness and\nirritability are common but often\noverlooked signs of burnout so if you\nstart to have trouble controlling your\nemotions especially when it never used\nto be a problem for you this might be\nthe reason why lazy people on the other\nhand are a stark contrast to this\nbecause they're often very relaxed laid\nback Placid and unaffected by things\nnumber five you've neglected your\nself-care one of the most distressing\nwarning signs that someone may be\nemotionally and physically burnt out is\nif you start neglecting your self-care\nand socially withdraw from others there\nare concerning changes in your eating\nand or sleeping patterns you stop making\nan effort to groom yourself or look good\nand you tend to spend most of your time\nby yourself doing nothing because you're\nso easily exhausted by even the simplest\nof tasks the difference between being\nburnt out and laziness are starkly in\nthe fact that you weren't always this\nway\nand number six these changes happened\ngradually\nfinally but perhaps most importantly\nsomething you should know about burnout\nis that it develops in stages so all the\npoints mentioned before losing interest\nto motivation especially in things we\nused to love feeling detached from\nyourself and disconnected from\neverything around you socially\nwithdrawing and neglecting your\nself-care won't just happen overnight\nstudies show that there are actually\nfive major stages of burnout each with\nincreasing degrees of severity the\nhoneymoon phase the onset of stress\nchronic stress burnout and habitual\nburnout many people begin to experience\nsymptoms as early as the second phase\nwhen there is still a moderate amount of\nstress but optimism interest motivation\nand performance may already start\ndeclining and by the time you reach the\nfifth and final stage burnout has\nalready become so embedded in your life\nthat the persistent mental and physical\nfatigue become more intense and harder\nto treat making you more vulnerable to\ndeveloping depression and anxiety\nspotting the signs of burnout early\nmakes it all the more easier for you to\nget help and recover from it that's why\nit's so important to raise awareness\nabout burnout instead of Simply\ndismissing it as laziness like most\npeople tend to do so if you or anyone\nyou know may be suffering from mental or\nemotional burnout please don't
