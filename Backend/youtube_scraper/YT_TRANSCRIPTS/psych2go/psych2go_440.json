engage in some of these behaviors\nfrom time to time but many of us are\nunwilling to admit it so how can you be\nmore aware of your unhelpful behaviors\nhow can you identify them in others in\nthis video we will be exploring seven\ntypes of these behaviors\nstonewalling perhaps you've been a\nvictim of the silent treatment before\nyou've been ignored by someone in your\nlife for a period of time but you don't\nalways know why this tactic is called\nstonewalling psych Central States that\nthis can be anything from someone\nwalking away from you after an argument\nand not speaking to you for days on end\nto someone deliberately shutting down\nand refusing to respond during a\nconfrontation\nthis is the type of punishment where the\nproblems at hand are not resolved\nbetterhelp advises that you should take\na step back from an argument and\ncontinue it when both parties are in a\nbetter headspace whether you're\nstonewalling or being stonewalled\napproaching a conflict grounded and\nrelaxed may help alleviate tension and\nallow everyone to organize their\nthoughts\nmore serious cases may need more serious\nhelp which can be done with a\nrelationship counselor\nisolating\nisolating can be a rather hidden form of\ntoxic Behavior you may not realize that\nit's been happening to you until you\nnotice that your Social Circle has\ndiminished this is usually the case when\na romantic partner tries to get you away\nfrom other people in your life\nthey may guilt-trip you for trying to go\nout or say that your friends are bad\ninfluences\nhope Gillette from Psych Central\nexplains that your partner May somehow\nalways come down with an illness or have\nsome other event planned at the same\ntime you have plans with other people\nthey guilt-trip you for seemingly\nprioritizing other people causing you to\nwithdraw from them over time slowly\nlacking self-awareness lacking\nself-awareness creates problems across\nthe board occupational health\npsychologist Dr Aaron Ito states that\npeople lacking in this area do not take\naccountability for their actions because\nthey can't understand that they're doing\nanything wrong\npeople short in this field may say and\ndo things that are unacceptable and\nself-sabotaging in nature but have no\nidea that their behaviors are harmful to\nthemselves and others when dealing with\nsomeone like this Dr Ido encourages\nsetting boundaries and enforcing them to\nprevent them from overstepping boundary\nviolations boundaries are extremely\nimportant for your well-being being able\nto State what you are and are not\ncomfortable with and upholding those\nboundaries protects you people that\nviolate your boundaries can damage your\nmental health by making you feel\npowerless\nlicensed professional counselor\nStephanie Cummins states that boundary\nviolations can look like people\ndisrespecting your time getting too\nclose to you physically\nlooking through personal items or plain\nand simply ignoring every time you say\nno\nwhile these are all incredibly\ndisrespectful they can make you feel\nthat your time is not your own or that\nyour wants and needs are not important\nto protect yourself it's important to be\nfirm when you set your limits and to be\nable to walk away when they're\ndisrespected gaslighting we rely a lot\non our perceptions thoughts and memories\nhowever gaslighters work to use these\nagainst us relationship therapist Dr\nElizabeth Frederick describes this as a\nmanipulation tactic to get you to doubt\nyour reality\ngaslighting comes in multiple forms but\nall revolves around getting you to put\nyour trust in the manipulator and not in\nyourself\nthey'll say that you misremembered\nthings or you're making something up\nanything is possible except your\nexperience they make it clear that they\nknow what's happening so you rely on\nthem to make your decisions for you\nblaming\naccountability is a healthy skill being\nable to admit when you're wrong and\ntaking steps to fix the situation is a\ngreat sign in a person blaming on the\nother hand diverts attention away from\nyou and onto something else people that\nuse this tactic often will seem to never\ntruly be wrong in a situation it's\nalways someone else's fault that\nsomething didn't go as planned\nmindbodygreen explains how blamers

Behavior as it can take\non many different shapes according to\nrelationship therapist Dr Elizabeth\nFrederick manipulation is a series of\ntactics that uses your values and\nemotions against you this can look like\nother types of toxic behaviors like love\nbombing where a person in your life will\nshower you with gifts and affection in\norder to get you to act a certain way in\nother cases they may create lose-lose\nscenarios whenever you try to make a\ndecision\nthere are endless ways a person can\nmanipulate you but in the end they all\nboil down to using your emotions and\nvalues to control you better help\nadvises boundary setting self-care and\nseeking help from a professional most\nimportantly you shouldn't blame yourself\nfor how others treat you there are\nendless amounts of toxic behaviors to be\naware of in other people but also\nourselves nobody is perfect and\nsometimes we can resort to unhealthy\nbehaviors it's important to acknowledge\nthis and work on self-improvement which\nmay involve the help of a mental health\nprofessional when dealing with toxic\npeople it's important to address these\nbehaviors with the person if they're\nwilling to or know
