they never loved you let's\nface the hardest one first narcissistic\nlove is often if not always one-sided\nrenowned Gestalt therapy trainer Eleanor\nGreenberg says narcissists are not in\nlove with the real you instead they've\nfallen in love with their own carefully\nconstructed fantasy about you and when\nthis fantasy falls apart they become\nangry bored and nasty they may say they\nlove you but with a narcissist love is\noften transactional like bad business\nexchange they love what you offer them\nthe compliments the praise and devotion\nnot you not the really you at least\nbecause the real you probably didn't fit\nthe narcissist picture-perfect fantasy\nin his book the psychology of romantic\nlove Canadian American psychotherapist\nNathaniel Brandon states that to love a\nhuman being is to know and love his or\nher person love means getting to know\nsomeone walking a mile in their shoes\nand loving them for who they are it\nmeans considering their feelings and\nmaking compromises\nnarcissists don't like a compromise\noften their way or the highway as\nCommunications Professor Brad Bushman of\nOhio State University put it best\nnarcissists are very bad relationship\nPartners number two never enough\nyou think that if you meet all their\nexpectations and keep the compliments\ncoming a narcissist will never leave you\nbut this is simply not true Teo
