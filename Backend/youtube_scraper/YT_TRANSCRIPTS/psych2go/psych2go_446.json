    "transcript": "Hello site to go viewers I'm Michelle\nRivas and I'm the host of psychology\nRoundtable Our Guest for today's live\nstream is psychiatrist and social media\npersonality Dr Sasha hamdani Dr Sasha's\ninspirational and educational content on\nMental Health has earned her thousands\nof followers and millions of views\nacross social media accounts it's an\nhonor to have her here today welcome Dr\nSasha thank you so much for joining us\ntoday thank you for having me what an\nintro absolutely you deserve it\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nyourself and your background\nyeah so\num\nmy name is Sasha hamnadi I was born in\nCalifornia and I I did my training right\nout of high school I got into medical\nschool\num and I landed in the midwest as I was\ngoing through medical school I started\nto\num struggle with my own mental health in\nterms of ADHD and everything else that\ncame with it which kind of led me down\nthe path of Psychiatry so I graduated\nfrom medical school got into Psychiatry\nresidency and then really niched down\nand just sub-specialized into\nADHD as like a clinical interest and\nthen in\num you know right around the time that\neverybody was joining social media like\nthe pandemic it was boring being at home\nand so I you know I got on to social\nmedia and started doing these small\neducational tidbits and some advocacy\nstuff online and it's kind of grown and\nit's banded since then across multiple\nplatforms and that led me to writing a\nbook self-care for people with ADHD\nwhich was released through Simon\nSchuster in January and releasing an app\nFocus Journey which came out last week\ncame out last week you can download in\nthe Apple Store and the Google Store\nyeah amazing okay we'll talk about that\nlater but um so I just wanted to start\nout I wanted you to Define exactly what\nADHD is because I feel like people are\nstill confused about it sometimes like\nthey don't know exactly what it is and\nsometimes people misdiagnose so just\ndefining what ADHD is and how is someone\ndiagnosed with it yeah that's a good\nquestion so ADHD is\num a clinical diagnosis that's like the\nfirst and foremost thing to talk about\nbecause there's a lot of people that\ndon't that question the validity of that\nbut yes it is it's in the DSM it's in\nit's qualified by the CDC and NIH and\nyou know it's it is a diagnosable\nmedical condition and it's a\nneurodevelopmental condition which means\na lot of the times it's passed down\ngenetically from throughout your family\nso you're born with it and it's\ncategorized it by three different things\nand it you don't necessarily have to\nhave all three of them it can be a\ndifferent variation of all three but\nit's inattentiveness\nhyperactivity and impulsivity\nso you have those three kind of main\npillars that you're dealing with and so\nADHD is broken into also three big\nclasses which are kind of similar to\nthat inattentive type ADHD so ADHD in a\ntattoo type which for a long time before\nthe name change happened in the DSM-5 it\nwas called add so a lot of people worry\nabout think about that distinction so\nit's basically all ADHD now but ADD is\nADHD inattentive type then there's ADHD\nhyperactive type and then there's ADHD\ncombined type which is kind of a\ncombination of the two yeah and\nsometimes people think it's all like\njust one thing right it's just ADHD and\nso with that being said what is ADHD\nparalysis and how does it interfere with\nthe person's ability to complete tasks\nyeah that's a really good question and\nit's it's kind of so 82 paralysis isn't\na\nit's not in the DSM criteria right so\nand when I'm saying DSM I'm talking\nabout that the diagnostic criteria laid\nout in that statistical manual so you\ncan so psychiatrists and therapists and\nanybody else who's clinically diagnosing\nsomething uses that criteria to see if\nyou meet it in order to give you that\ndiagnosis so ADHD paralysis isn't in\nthere basically what it is is it's\ndiscussing\nwhen you have executive dysfunction so\nthat's an inability to with to start to\nsustain to complete tasks because you\nare feeling tremendously anxious or\nstressed or fatigued so it's it's a it's\na breakdown in goal directed activity\nand people why it's called paralysis is\nthey literally feel stuck in that moment\nyeah they feel like it's like a freeze\nmm-hmm\nand so how is it different from\nprocrastination though because some\npeople would say well isn't it just the\nsame as procrastinating yeah I mean\nthat's a really good question too\nbecause I think procrastination there is\na component of it a component which can\nbe volitional right which can be like I\nknow this is coming up\nI'm just gonna ignore it like I'll deal\nwith it later and you Turf that stuff\nand you push it off till later and you\nknow that that can be you know due to\nuh you know difficulty with like\nunderstanding time it can be difficulty\nby being overwhelmed it could be for a\nlot of different reasons but you're\nconscious of that I feel like ADC\nparalysis or task paralysis or executive\nfunction breakdown\num for the most part I think can be\ninvolved oh is involuntary you you get\nto the point where you are so over\nsaturated with stimuli with with being\noverwhelmed with being tired with being\nanxious that your brain literally those\ngears are not working and you can't\nthink about that next step because\nyou're Frozen yeah and do you think that\nit kind of goes together with depression\nand anxiety sometimes I comorbidly\nI think it can I and what's tricky about\nADHD like clinically as a prescriber\nyeah um and someone who diagnoses this\nwhat's tricky about it is that a lot of\nthe times when you have significant ADHD\ndysfunction it impacts every facet of\nyour life so you look anxious you look\ndepressed and it doesn't necessarily\nmean you have that underlying it could\nbe that that\nair of dysfunction is so much that it's\ncausing symptoms that look like ADHD and\ndepression although there is a high\ncorrelation you know a fourth of people\nwith ADHD also have anxiety and almost\nas much have\num\ncross correlation with depression so it\nthere it's it's just a very nuanced\nfield there's a lot going on yeah and\nlike that paralysis it can stop people\nfrom even like completing tasks like\nbasic hygiene right even things like\nthat like getting up and more than\nbrushing their teeth and so I think that\nsometimes it can go you know hand in\nhand with depression or exacerbate like\ndepression and anxiety it's just a\nvicious cycle yes yep for sure and then\nin terms of like brain function research\nshows that ADHD paralysis is caused by a\ndopamine imbalance in the brain could\nyou explain how this works to our\nviewers\nokay\nkind of\nexactly would you disagree because I\nknow it's a research and like maybe you\ndon't agree with it but do you agree\nthat it's a dopamine imbalance or no I\nso here's here's why I'm hesitating uh I\nthink it's a complicated phenomenon\nbecause a lot of times people when\nthey're talking about this dopamine\nTheory there's a lot of it's easy to say\nI don't have enough dopamine in my brain\nand that's what's causing these problems\nwhen really the truth is is it's not\nthat you don't have enough dopamine you\nmight have perfect amounts of dopamine\nit's just not in the right place or that\nit's being used up too quickly or that\nit's in you know it's being you know\nrecirculated at a pace that's not\nappropriate for the situation\nso that's why it becomes a little bit\ndifferent so when you're looking at\ndopamine dysregulation theories there's\na lot we don't actually know exactly\nwhat it's from we don't know if it's\nbecause it's excessive breakdown we\ndon't know if it's not being a\nsynthesized appropriately or enough\nquantity we don't know if it's just\nbeing expressed in the wrong area\num so it's really multifaceted I think\ndopamine is a big major player in this\nand I can tell that\num because when you're looking at it's\nyou know\nadc's intercorrelation with like reward\nPathways and how people like Express\nthat in their brain there's there's a\nhigh crossover there it also makes a lot\nof sense when you're thinking about\ncertain medications that work and why\nthey're so effective they're they're\nbeing they're\npartially active on that norepinephrine\nand dopamine pathway so I think it is\ninvolved I can't I don't know exactly\nhow it is involved do you feel like in\nthe future it'd be good if they could\nlike create technology that could\nactually show you exactly where these\nimbalances are oh my God I mean I dream\nabout that but yeah what I'm saying that\nI'm like being 100 serious that's where\nmy dreams go I actually recently\ninterviewed um someone a week ago his\nname is Dr Alexander nicholasco and he's\nactually creating research and\ndeveloping tests on how to like measure\nanxiety and depression in blood\nlike how yeah so I I think that's\namazing maybe ADHD is next we'll see but\nright ready right we're ready for it but\nand then sometimes people who experience\nADHD paralysis they'll just be labeled\nas lazy by others how do we fight this\nproblematic stigma because it is\ninvalidating and a lot of people feel\nlike ashamed to come forward with ADHD\nbecause they just think they're going to\nbe labeled as like a lazy person or a\nbum and you know that's not fair so not\nfair because I feel like\num\nI don't know I'm probably biased in this\nbut\nas someone who has ADC man I feel like I\nwork hard all the time right I don't\nfeel lazy I mean and so I think that it\nis a like I think if we could somehow\ndestigmatize this enough so that people\nunderstand that it's your brain is\nuniquely wired so it's not necessarily\nthat you are lazy it's that you have\ndysregulation happening so the way you\nattend to attention and emotion is\ndifferent than what I think a\nneurotypical person deals with so when\nyou're expected to perform\num along the same metrics it's easy to\ncompare those two things but they're two\ntotally different brains\num and so it's I think that as we're\nbeginning to progress a little bit more\nand understand more and learn how to\naccommodate different\nforms of neurodivergence I think\npeople are more ready to have these\nconversations but I think that that it's\nlike this this live stream I think is\nfabulous because right we're getting\nwe're getting eyes on things and we're\nlearning and we're exposing and talking\nmore about about this as a phenomenon so\nthat more and more people recognize this\nas like hey we should be talking about\nthis we should be we should be opening\nup ways\nto accommodate and change our structure\nso that we can get the best possible\nwork out of these people instead of just\nimmediately labeling them as lazy\nabsolutely and how do you feel like the\nsame people who make the argument about\npeople with maybe ADHD being lazy or\nprocrastinating you know procrastinating\num they would say that a lot of people\nor I guess they would have that same\nargument that they um don't take\naccountability for their actions that\nthey just want to blame the ADHD and um\nlike what do you have to say about that\nargument because I also feel like that's\ninvalidating\nI would agree with you\num if there's a lot around that right\nbecause a lot of people they think that\npeople are using ADHD as an excuse and I\nI think it's really important to\nunderstand that it's not an excuse it's\nan explanation right I'm trying to\nexplain to you how my brain is working\nand I'm you know for example if we had\nsomething where\nI'll give you a random example I turn in\nsomething late right and then I'm like\nGod I'm sorry I I have ADHD it just you\nknow maybe that's not like a solid\nexplanation but if I'm saying I was\ntrying to turn it in and I at the last\nsecond the last like three minutes\nbefore it was due I got distracted by\nsomething else and I was unable to pull\nmy attention away but I had this full\nintention of doing that and I have been\nready this entire time there's some\nexplanation there like okay you got\ndistracted and it's harder to turn your\nattention away from things that are\nhighly stimulating and so like you know\nit I think it gives a little bit more\nGrace and understanding because there's\nthere is a lot to be said when you're\njust looking at people\nwho are not ready to hear that right\nthey're not ready to hear about ADHD\nbecause they think that this was a\npurposeful of mission or that you know\nthere was the intent of being late or\nthat you didn't prioritize this task\nwhen really you might have been\nprioritizing it the whole time and this\nlike at the last second slip through\nyour fingers yeah and like I mean in a\nsituation like that you can prove well I\ndid the assignment but and just because\nI feel like that's why teachers need to\nbe more understanding of that but that's\nwhy you're seeing in universities they\nhave like accommodations now for like\nmental health issues so that's good\num so I mean I agree with that but yeah\na lot of people would say like oh well\nit's not holding people accountable I\nguess there is a limit though right\nthere is a limit to where someone can't\njust say well it's my ADHD there has to\nbe a point where it's like okay well I\nhave to take responsibility for not\ndoing something or complete a test how\ndo you feel about that of course yeah of\ncourse I think I think that there is\num it's I don't even think it's a fine\nline I think what what needs to happen\nis that with ADHD you need to understand\nhey here are my limitations here's what\nI'm not necessarily good at and here's\nwhat I'm great at and learning how to\nbalance those two things so that you can\nfunction in society is important so if\nyou're lucky enough to be in a situation\nwhere you're in like someone is\naccommodating of of ADHD and of like\nthese neurodivergent differences\nutilize that and work with them to to\nbuild an architecture that you can\nthrive in\nwhile still being held accountable like\nyou gotta do these things to progress in\nsociety and be proud of it but you want\nto have you want to have certain\naccommodations so that you're allowed to\nthrive right you can't exactly get out a\nfree card every time you have to you\nhave to put in the work and find a way\nto thrive absolutely and so for those\nsuffering from ADHD paralysis what\ncoping strategies or treatment options\ndo you recommend I know it's different\nfor every person but like generally\nspeaking\nI I that's a really good question and I\nget it all the time and I feel like my\nanswer is different all the time but the\none thing that stays stable\nis I think that the most important thing\nwhen you are trying to find ways to cope\nwith that is to understand what your\npatterns are and so if you understand\nyour own behavior and if you're like\nthis is how much eating impacts me this\nis how much drinking impacts me this is\nhow much sleeping impacts me this is how\nmuch exercise impacts me\num this is this is when I typically feel\nanxious this is when I typically feel\ndepressed that those data points are so\nhelpful especially for this ADHD\nparalysis because then once you\nunderstand your patterns number one you\ncan hopefully avoid those periods of\nADHD paralysis a little bit better\nbecause you're not getting so\noverwhelmed and and sucked up in that\nmoment and then number two you recognize\nyour patterns enough to know how to\nclimb out of it and I think that's\nwhat's really important so everybody has\nits slightly different answer I'll tell\nyou in my case like just a week ago this\nis a good timing a week ago I was in\nthat spot where I was just absolutely\noverwhelmed with too many things and I I\nexplained it like my brain is too full\nlike nothing is coming in nothing is\ncoming out but I understand my\nexpectations of what I'm supposed to say\nI saw that video and it was so relatable\nand inspiring thank you thank you for\nthat you're welcome but it was it was so\nit was like I really struggled whether\nor not to post that because I first of\nall like crying on the internet well\nyour followers love you because you're\nhonest and transparent that's like what\nit is because you know I think that I\njust I'm sorry to interject but I think\nwhen people see you they see this like\naccomplished psychiatrist as Doctor it's\nintimidating right and people can't\nalways relate to that but you're being\nhuman and people can relate to that and\nthey love it and that's why they follow\nyou they don't follow you because oh\nyou're a psychiatrist they follow you\nbecause you're Sasha and they they think\nthat you're relatable and you are\nrelatable and you're amazing so yeah\ncome on\num it it but the video itself I think it\ncame from a place of just like\nI mean just getting smoked on every\nfront and so I I just it it I mean\nreally Michelle it took me three days to\ncome out of that like three solid days\nwhere I was out and I felt like that was\na time where I I had all that pressure\nto do all these things my app was\nlaunching I had a lot of family stuff\nstuff going on\num work was like a lot I have a lot of\npatients in a small amount of time and\nso I I it was so it was so difficult for\nme in that three days to kind of figure\nout because I'm like I need to be\nfunctional right now and yeah and\neverybody was like no thank you so I\nthink it's just a matter of like when\nwhen I got into that spot I recognized\nlike okay I know that my my needs are\nthis and I don't have much to give what\nwhat do I need to prioritize so this\nwill be over in the fastest way possible\nand what I needed to Prior is I needed\nto get calories in I needed to get\nadequate sleep and I needed to like\nexercise off the table no way it's like\nI know it's probably good for me but\nthat and my body was just like no I\ncan't like no\num and then I needed to hydrate I mean I\nwas like I hadn't I I was like running a\nthousand miles an hour I had like I\ndidn't have a sip of water in like three\ndays because I was just like all over\nthe place oh my God see self-care is\nimportant you have to like breathe and\nlike you know think about yourself for a\nsecond and it's just like you get you\nget so consumed by other things that you\njust like you forget all of these\nimportant important important things and\nso like that's what I prioritized and\nand one of the things that's on that\nFocus Genie app which I literally was\ncreated because this is because I was in\none of those holes at the time is they\nhave a focus tracker where you can track\nlike this how much water it dries this\nis how much I ate this is how much I\nslept this is how impulsive I was this\nis what my mood was so you didn't like\nrealized it yeah yeah so I went back and\nI didn't and think about the water thing\nuntil I went back and I was looking and\nI they had like I had tracked my thing\nand I was like no I really haven't been\ndrinking water so it was it was nice to\nbe able to go back and be like okay well\nat least I can I can better identify my\npatterns this way\nabsolutely and um like was it\ntherapeutic to talk about it on camera\nlike a release\n[Music]\nyeah I mean to some degree I think\nthere's some posts there's some posts\nwhere I'm like really excited to see\nwhat people would say and there's some\nposts where I'm like too fragile of a\nspot to like really pick up and process\nand I think I was in that spot where I'm\nlike I can't even so like I filmed it I\nmade the decision to post it I was like\nI'll come back to an hour if I want to\ntake it down and so I didn't really like\nthink about it or look at it for\nactually and then I waited a little bit\nlonger because I forgot about it yeah\nand then later I saw those messages and\nthey were so wonderful and supportive\nand kind yeah but I am\nokay no I mean that's good though\nbecause there are a lot of internet\ntrolls I get why you'd be kind of\nhesitant like I don't know\noh my God my channel is so nice\neverybody on literally everybody on\nthere it's like a support group they're\nso wonderful like I'm getting to the\nspot where I'm getting to recognize\nnames on there and it feels very\nI don't know very inclusive and great\nand sometimes like even when I need\nreminders of stuff I'll go back through\nthe comment section I'm like oh that's a\ngood idea\ndoes that remind me of our audience here\nat psych2go supportive amazing and\nlovely just a thank you to you guys so\nthat brings me to our audience segment\nwhere we answer your viewer questions\nI'm super excited about this are you\nready Sasha of course awesome before we\nget to that I just wanted to say guys we\nhave our new book out at Barnes and\nNobles and Amazon the psychology of\npeople by Thomas Tang if you guys can\nsee it you guys can get it now it came\nout on the 19th it's one of Amazon's top\nreleases please support us there's a\nlink in the description we also have our\nBarnes and Nobles book and coffee event\ncoming up so just look out for that link\nin the description so let's get started\nSasha Dr Sasha I respond to anything\nawesome so let's see we have a lot of\npeople in here so let's see what\nthey're saying so\nokay Teresa asks how do I tell my\nparents that I think I have ADHD I'm 25\nyears old but I'm afraid that they'll\nostracize me for my mental health issues\nyeah I mean that's a good question thank\nyou Teresa that's a really good question\nand it's it's a tricky thing\nwhether it's ADHD or anything else right\nanything else and then mental health\nsphere it's always it's always tricky to\nknow the right way to disclose that and\na lot of the time it really depends on\nwho your family is and what your\nDynamics are and things like that what\nI've found personally and I mean I think\nthis is just from\nbeing both a provider and a patient I've\nfound that like from a personal\nperspective like if I keep things as\nclinical as possible it really it takes\naway like the emotional component of it\nwhich I think people when you they talk\nabout mental health it's hard it's hard\nto separate those two but if you're\nsaying things like you know I I went\nthrough and I I was talking to the\ntherapist and I I looked into you know\nand we were talking a lot about how\ndifficult it was\nfor me to focus and and name certain\nthings and the emotional side of things\nand you you really get into like\nclinical data\num you I maybe people would be more\nreceptive to that and there'd be less of\nthat air of judgment\nyou can also like have your parents go\nin with you to like a therapy or a\ndiagnostic session\nand have the therapist do that for you\ntherapists or psychiatrist or somebody\num Dr Sasha you've mentioned that you\nhave ADHD how did your parents like\nembrace it\nstory was weird so I I got diagnosed in\nfourth grade and I I it got picked up it\nwasn't really talked about at the time\nbut it got picked up because I I\npresented as really hyperactive and so I\nwas like\nwreaking havoc in my classroom and so\nlike\nwhen they when they got you know when my\nteachers talked to them and they got\nkind of pushed along pediatrician and\nthings like that at that point\nthey were like okay I get it I see it\nand so they they\nwe I started on medication but we didn't\nreally talk about it because it wasn't\ntalked about a lot and then I didn't I\nwas on medication and I didn't actually\nrealize I had ADHD\nor that I was taking medication for ADHD\nspecifically I thought it was like just\na vitamin that's going to help me until\nI got to med school and then that's when\nwe really had conversations about it wow\nand how did and they embraced it though\nor were they cut they didn't know like\nyou know what it was at first\nI think they I think they knew what it\nwas they just didn't know how to Broach\nit with me being in fourth grade and I\nwe've talked about it since then and I\nthink they would have done things\ndifferently now but when when I was in\nmedical school and trying to figure it\nout I think the handles are really well\nbecause they gave me a safe place to\nexplore it on my own because initially I\nwas like there's no way and I rebelled\nagainst the diagnosis that I fell behind\nin school and it was just really\ndifficult for me\nand then they were like just come home\nand let's instead of focusing on school\njust focus on ADHD really get into it\nand so we were going into the library we\nwere going and researching on our own we\nwere talking amongst each other and and\ntrying to make a game plan and\nunderstand the brain a little bit better\nand that that's safe play that week-long\nexploration into ADHD and having that\nsafe place to answer questions and to\nexplore this I think was really\nwonderful\nabsolutely\num you know sometimes people just need\nto be educated on these things it's not\nthat they're you know a lot of people\nsometimes they don't they're not trying\nto be cruel or rude about mental health\nissues they just don't know and so it's\ngood to educate people that's what we're\ntrying to do outside to go that's what\nDr Sasha's doing and so next question is\nby style fairy hopefully I'm not\nbutchering your name so Dr Sasha how\ndoes ADHD link to social anxiety in\ngeneral\num that's a good question I think that\nlike we talked about earlier in this\nlive some of it is that you get some\nanxiety from ADHD when ADHD is isn't\nproperly managed and some of it is you\ncan have anxiety as a completely\nseparate problem\num and you know anxiety can sometimes\ncause Focus issues that look like ADHD\nso it can be that this is anxiety with\nFocus issues it can be Focus issues that\ncause anxiety or it could be a\ncombination of both\num really one of the biggest questions I\nask patients when we're trying to figure\nthat out is\ndo you feel\nlike you're we'll we'll do it we'll do\nit from the anxiety perspective do you\nfeel like your anxiety is caused by your\ninability to focus\nor\ndo you feel like you're\ninability\ndo you feel like your anxiety is caused\nby I have to do it the other way around\nbecause I'm talking about Focus usually\nso when I'm talking about ADHD and\ntrying to figure out if it's from\nanxiety\nis your lack of focus causing anxiety\nor is your anxiety causing a lack of\nfocus\nso that way you can kind of figure out\nand if it's like I don't know man\num it's entirely possible that it could\nbe both\nmm-hmm\nso\nit could be yeah it could be one or the\nother but it's just crazy how like\nsometimes people don't even realize they\nactually have anxiety and depression and\nADHD and so they're not getting the help\nthat they need sometimes totally yeah\nand so then Selena asks my boyfriend\nsays that my ADHD behavior and laziness\nis unattractive and a turn off how do I\ndeal with this and how do I explain to\nhim that I'm not doing it on purpose\nsounds kind of toxic Selena\nI don't like him\num here's the deal I I think that if\nwe're being as judgment neutral because\nlike when that falls on my ears I hate\nit\num but I think if I'm being as neutral\nas possible it really boils down to the\nfact of like ADC is something that most\nof the time you're born with and like\nyou work to to cope with and handle on a\nregular basis\nand so this is going to be an ongoing\nthing that you support and manage and so\nwith with finding a partner or Partners\nor you know finding people that you\nallow into your life you want to\nfind people that are going to support\nand cherish you throughout this process\nbecause it's a long process of trying to\nfigure out all those variables\nso I think\nexplaining it to him and explaining it\nclinically and how this isn't a failure\nit's not a moral failure it's not\nsomething that you're purposefully doing\nthis is just your brain works a little\nbit differently that could go two ways\none it could be like\ntotally understand where you're coming\nfrom I can't believe I didn't think\nabout it this way how can I support you\nPrimo that's a good response if you get\nI don't really believe that I don't know\nif that's true I think you're just lazy\nyeah that's unsupportive it's not it's\nnot that it's unsupport I mean yes it is\ntotally unsupportive but it's also\nindicating that you know\nyou're doing your due diligence and\nyou're explaining to him kind of how\nyour brain works and if you're not\ngetting like at least a listening ear or\nwilling to kind of explore this together\nthat might not change\nand I think that paying attention to\nlanguage is important because using the\nwords laziness procrastination it's not\napproaching the situation with empathy\nor compassion\nand so if someone's just gonna throw out\nlike mean words you know then that's\ndefinitely not going to help the\nsituation so I'm sorry about that Selena\nI thought it's a turn off come on Selena\nyou're not a turn off and introduce you\nto someone else it'll be fine right and\nthen I love this next question because\nit kind of goes with the last one\nAllison Romero asked how or in what way\ncan you support your partner who has\nADHD I love that thank you I love that\nquestion I love that question\num I so number one is first\nunderstanding how your partner's brain\nworks um asking questions coming from a\nneutral and non-judgmental place like\nproviding them a safe place that they\ncan talk to you about it and you can\nwork on Solutions together I mean I will\ntell you from personal experience this\nis what I think my partner does really\nwell because I think he\nI know he does not have ADHD his brain\nworks like just very\nanalytically and like we just think\ncompletely differently\nand there are things that I know\nprobably just irritate him to no end in\nin the way that my brain works and vice\nversa but the way that we have managed\nor have figured out how to get past that\nis through communication like we have\njust kind of figured out how to\ncommunicate those things to each other\nlovingly without I mean it took us a\nsecond but like without confrontation or\nwithout it being offensive to the other\nperson so once you kind of figure out\nhow to talk to your partner and once you\nguys are both coming from a place where\nit's supportive and you're working to\nbuild together I think that's really\npowerful and wonderful\nand you know opening that dialogue\ncommunication is everything right\ntotally yeah and then let's see\noh and then just so that you can clarify\nthis again because you did mention this\nbut some people maybe came to the live\nlate lollipop the robot ass is ADHD\nparalysis at part or a part of ADHD or\nis it a different diagnosis\nactually part of the formal diagnostic\ncriteria so it's something that we kind\nof colloquially talk about and it's it's\nit's something that we just it's like a\nconversational term for discussing\num executive dysfunction like this is a\nproblem we need to address this a little\nbit more carefully\num because I feel very Frozen and stuck\num that's what that's what that ADHD\nparalysis side of things is but it's not\npart of that diagnostic criteria but to\nbe totally honest with you I think the\ndiagnostic criteria for ADHD is pretty\nnarrow and kind of stupid so I think\nthere's a lot of room for improvement so\nmaybe it will be I don't know\nuh they said that if you don't get I've\nheard this before that if you don't get\ndiagnosed as a child with ADHD that you\ncan't get diagnosed as an adult is that\ntrue or how does it work so no that's\nnot true I mean you can get diagnosed\nkind of at any time but what I would say\nis that you would have had to show\nsymptoms as a child so even if you\nweren't diagnosed because there are a\nlot of people that didn't have access to\ncare or were running around untreated or\ntheir parents didn't want to go and get\nthem evaluated and they didn't carry\nthat diagnosis but they had symptoms so\nI think it I would have had to present\nbefore age 12 but you don't necessarily\nhave had to have had a diagnosis that's\ncrazy yeah no that's insane\num because and what's the difference\nbetween ADHD and add\nso there is none so ADHD is what they\ncall all of it now add is kind of an\noutdated term and it's more most akin to\nADHD inattentive type\nokay that's that's interesting I didn't\neven know that thank you for clarifying\nthat and then this last question um I\nthink it's just interesting because\nsometimes people don't know what the\ncauses are behind ADHD but um Rachel\nMiranda asked what is the root cause of\nADHD obviously there's not just one but\nno there isn't just one I mean\nfundamentally this is neurodevelopmental\nit gets passed on through families it's\na genetic thing\num there is a lot of other\num things that they're looking at like\nperimatal factors and and other things\num\nsome people have seen an association\nwith head trauma\num but for the most part that's one of\nthe biggest components there is some you\nknow there's an entirely separate school\nof thought where they're looking at like\ntrauma focus and and how that's related\nto ADHD but it's still theoretical and\nnot proven\nI mean the trauma definitely doesn't\nhelp ADHD does it cause ADHD I think\nit's a separate thing\nthank you for that Dr Sasha and that\nconcludes our audience section thank you\nso much for that\nappreciate it so now we're gonna move\nover to the last segment of our\ninterview and I just wanted to talk\nabout Focus Genie could you explain that\nto our viewers it's an app that you can\ndownload on Apple the Google Store\navailable on iPhone Android correct yeah\nperfect and it gives people like the\ntools um people with ADHD the tools to\nsort of like understand their behavior\nand to also help them navigate what\nthey're struggling with\nit's so much better than that\nit's so much better so Focus Genie is\nsomething that I um\nI worked on I've been working on it for\nabout two and a half years and it is\nbasically\nthe place to start like if you had if\nyou think you have ADHD or if you have a\nloved one with ADC because it's got two\nparts it's got an educational side and\nit's got a functional productivity side\nso the educational side is like these\nlittle like there it's like social media\nswipe throughs and it's a broken down by\nlike area so there's like relationship\nstuff there's professional stuff there's\nphysical stuff there's fundamentals and\nthere are little tiny educational\nmodules\num that you with key points and polls\nand so it's it's engaging\num that you can learn from and every\nmonth there are new ones being added\num and then on the other side there's\nproductivity tools so there's things\nthat even break down your tasks there's\nto-do lists that you can break down by\ncategory there's a focus tracker where\nyou can track you know your food your\nwater your um your sleep your mood your\nimpulsivity all of that stuff gets\ntracked and it's visually kind of\ndepicted into Insight so you see your\npatterns over time\num you could body double with people if\nyou feel like you need someone to help\nyou there's ADHD focused audio there's a\njournaling section so all of those\nthings together\nworking to kind of help support the\nperson and then on top of all of that\ngamified so it's it's engaging you're\nearning coins You're motivated to keep\ngoing\num so I I just felt like this was\nI was trying to think about like what is\nsomething that I really would have used\nin medical school when I was struggling\nand it to keep me on track to get me\nthrough schooling so I could understand\nmy own brain from like a neutral spot\nbecause with the pandemic I understood\nhow difficult care was to access\num and with social media and things like\nthat I love it because I can give\ninformation but it's so disorganized\nit's hard to like give you like you know\nif someone wants to look for something\nit's hard to find all of this\ninformation about that it's just\nscattered and you're kind of at the will\nof the algorithm so this is just nice\nthat it's all in one spot so it's like a\ngo-to for it's not just for ADHD right\nthough but like for anyone dealing with\nlike mental health struggles so it's the\neducational Parts talk about ADHD pretty\nspecifically but I think the\nproductivity tools can be used for\nanything and as we're getting more and\nmore feedback we've had patients that\nare not even if they're not even formal\npatients but we've had people that are\nsuffering from anxiety and stressful is\nstruggling from depression that have\nreally benefited from all of it so it\nwas just a nice asset so it's like a\ngo-to kind of like a tool that you can\nuse when you're struggling I have it\nright here this is what it looks like\nguys if you can see it\nright here it's um available for\ndownload on like what like what you said\non the Apple Store in the Apple Store\nAndroid\num it's free like you said and it's\nsuper easy like it

per year it's four\nbucks per month and then um by if it's\nby month it's six bucks a month because\nI wanted to make it less than a cup of\ncoffee per month try out that free trial\nit's worth a try
