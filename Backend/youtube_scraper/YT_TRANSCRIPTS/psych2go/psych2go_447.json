    "transcript": "hey psych goers have you been talking to\nyour crush lately and you're not sure if\nthey're flirting or just being nice\nflirting can be a tricky thing many of\nus are often left wondering how we\nshould act around the people we like or\nwhat the right thing to say would be how\nwe can subtly let them know that we're\ninterested in them and in turn decipher\nif they feel the same way it can all get\nreal complicated real fast and the last\nthing any one of us would want is to\npossibly jeopardize our friendship with\nthem by making things awkward don't\nworry though here are 8 telltale signs\nthat can help you tell the difference\nbetween someone who might be interested\nin you and someone who is just being\nnice\nnumber one they're nice to everyone\nthe first thing you should always take a\nlook at when trying to figure out\nsomeone's feelings for you is to compare\nthe way they treat you to the way they\ntreat everyone else are they just as\nfriendly with you as they are with a lot\nof other people there are actually a lot\nof people who are just very friendly\nchatty and comfortable joking around\nwith lots of people be careful not to\nread too much into it and keep an eye\nout for any of these other signs too\nnumber two\nthey never initiate anything\nsure you might be talking to this person\na lot and spending lots of time with\nthem but think back on the last time the\ntwo of you actually made plans who was\nthe one to initiate it have they ever\nactually gone out of their way to spend\ntime with you or strike up conversation\nwith you if you're the only one doing\nmost of the initiating then it's most\nlikely that although this person\ncertainly enjoys spending time with you\nthey're not flirting with you\nnumber three they don't hang out with\nyou alone\nsimilar to the points made earlier just\nbecause someone spends time with you and\ntalks to you A lot it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that they're trying to\nstart anything with you especially if\nthey never hang out with you alone so if\nthe only time you and this person ever\nget together is with a bunch of mutual\nfriends around then they probably just\nwant to be friends and nothing more\nnumber four they keep a respectful\nphysical distance while some people may\nbe more comfortable with it than others\ntouching and other acts of physical\naffection can be completely platonic and\nappropriate with friends most people try\nto keep their touch respectful and only\nreciprocate the touches you initiate or\nwhen appropriate like to comfort you\nwhen you're upset scared or anxious\nnumber five they're careful about what\nthey talk about another Telltale sign\nthat someone's just being friendly and\nnot actually flirting with you is if\nthey're careful about what the two of\nyou talk about even our closest friends\nare mindful not to send mixed signals\nthat is they usually keep your\nconversations restricted to more\nfriendly territory like what's going on\nin your lives how you're doing how\nyou're feeling and any common interests\nyou might share\nnumber six they don't open up too much\nagain the simplest Act of striking up a\nfew conversations with someone isn't\nenough evidence that they have feelings\nfor you or are trying to flirt with you\nespecially if they're careful not to\nopen up to you too much so think back on\nthe last time you and this person spoke\ndid they seem guarded to you at all are\nthere some things you sensed they might\nhave been reluctant to share or talk to\nyou about it might be because they were\nworried that sharing too much might give\nyou the wrong idea behind their\nintentions\nof course some people are naturally more\nguarded so that may be the case as well\nnumber seven they let conversations end\norganically one of the best ways we can\ndistinguish between someone who just\nwants to be friends and someone who\nwants more is by looking at the way our\nconversations end with them\nif they like to keep talking to you for\nas long as possible even about the most\nmundane things then they might be\nflirting\non the other hand if they just let your\nconversations fizzle out and reach their\nnatural stopping points then they're\nlikely just being friendly with you and\nfinally number eight they talk about\ntheir crushes with you last but not\nleast while this sign might be the most\nobvious of all it's still worth\nmentioning here\nif this person is comfortable enough to\ntalk to you about who they like who they\nfind attractive or who they might be\nromantically interested in then that's a\nclearer sign as any that they only see\nyou as a friend and nothing more after\nall when you're flirting with someone\nit's particularly taboo to insinuate to\nthem that there might be other people\nyou're interested in\nbecause that's just going to ruin your\nchances of winning them over\nso do you relate to any of the things\nwe've mentioned here has this list\nhelped you figure out if someone is just\nbeing friendly to you or if they're\ngenuinely flirting with you remember\nthis list is not a guarantee every\nsituation is different\ndid you find this video valuable
