    "transcript": "- While beauty is in\nthe eye of the beholder\nand standards of beauty\nand attraction change,\ndepending on the culture,\nthere are things that many\ngenerally find unattractive.\nAttraction is the power\nof evoking interest in\nor liking for something or\nsomeone that's the desirability\nor appeal that someone\nhas that draws others in.\nPhysical attributes and\nappearance typically play into\nattraction, but so do your\nbehaviors and engagement.\nToday we'll talk about how\negocentric behaviors can destroy\nthe image we have in front of others\nand make you appear unattractive.\nWe'll break these behaviors\ninto three main attributes,\nnarcissism, manipulation, and insecurity.\nSome of these behaviors overlap,\nbut they all stem from a\nsimilar place, a toxic ego.\nNumber two, narcissism.\nIn past videos like seven signs,\nsomeone is secretly a\nnarcissist and others.\nWe've identified key traits\nof a narcissistic personality.\nNarcissists often get a bad rap.\nThey're portrayed as\nevil, conniving, people\nwho are out to get TheStreet.\nOthers, while some of\ntheir behaviors are hurtful\nand unacceptable, they\nthemselves are not evil\nunless they actually are.\nThat's an entirely different conversation.\nUnfortunately, they're a\nproduct of their environment.\nWhile some studies suggest\nthat narcissism is a heritable\ntrade, it is believed\nthat many narcissists are a\nproduct of their circumstances.\nHowever, this trait\nunfortunately makes you seem less\nattractive in the eyes of\nothers behaviors like blame,\nshifting, self-centeredness, arrogance,\nand one upmanship repel people\nand make it difficult to create\nand maintain relationships\nbecause narcissism at its\ncore is a lack of security\nand a shaken sense of self-worth.\nIt is difficult for a narcissist\nto create relationships.\nNumber two, manipulation.\nManipulation is often associated\nwith narcissistic personality disorder.\nHowever, someone who's\nmanipulative is not necessarily a\nnarcissist To some\ndegree, we have all used\nor tried to manipulate others, handle\nor influence another person\naccording to what we want.\nHowever, repetitive\nand deliberate manipulation\nis different behaviors such\nas undermining others,\nconstantly being defensive\nand flexible or not accepting\nFeedback are examples\nof manipulative behaviors,\nmanipulative people\nwho put others down and exalt themselves.\nTheir qualities or attributes\nmake it difficult for others\nto get close to them, let alone\nwant to have a relationship.\nNumber three, insecurity, narcissism\nand insecurity are two\nsides of the same coin.\nThey both stem from a\ndesire to heal inner wounds\nthat have caused low self-esteem\nand self-worth these conditions\nwhile similar manifest\ndifferently behaviors like\nnegative self-talk, lack\nof authenticity, and constantly\nseeking validation are\ngenerally associated with\nan insecure personality.\nUnfortunately, these behaviors make you\nundesirable in front of others.\nPeople generally have negative\nreactions towards people\nwho exhibit insecurities.\nSociety has programmed us to find security\nand proactiveness as\ndesirable traits in leaders,\nrole models, and even potential mates.\nHaving insecurity\n- Does not mean there is\nsomething wrong with you,\nit's something that can be worked on.\nDid you relate to any of these traits?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nThe good news is the traits\nmentioned in this video can be\nchanged and reformed.\nIf you seek to change, you can reach out\nto a licensed medical\nprofessional for help always.\nThanks for watching."
