    "transcript": "[Music]\nmy boss worked so hard she's the type to\nstay at least two hours after closing\nand come in on weekends she's very\ninspirational but I'm nothing like her\nam I lazy it's time to do some research\ngrab your journal and take notes with me\ntaking a day off\nokay so my boss would never take a\nmental health day she literally works on\nvacations does it make me lazy that\nsometimes I feel like I need a break\naccording to Dr Timothy J Legg knowing\nwhen to take a mental health day for\nyourself is crucial to maintaining your\noverall health and well-being both in\nand outside the workplace it can be very\neasy to feel that poor mental health\nisn't a good reason to take time for\nyourself especially when most of society\nsees a sick day is something only\nreserved for a cold or flu however our\nmental health is equally as important to\nour overall well-being as our physical\nhealth Dr Light continues by saying we\naren't talking about the usual Sunday\nscaries or just feeling bored or not\nexcited to go into the office if you\nwake up and feel especially stressed\ndown or anxious at a level that impairs\nyour functioning it's time to consider\ntaking the day off\ngoing to bed late\nmy boss gets up every single morning at\n5am I wish I could feel like that and I\nfeel like I work better at night is it\nlazy if I don't wake up early and start\ngetting things accomplished according to\nsleep specialist Rafael peleo many\npeople have genetic Tendencies towards\nbeing a morning person or a night owl\nbut these Tendencies do not determine a\nperson's sleep patterns being a night\nowl does not equate to being lazy in\nfact it's genetic and our preferences\nare a chronotype and doesn't have\nanything to do with your work ethic\nunfortunately if need be your body is\ncapable of making some adjustments the\nimportant thing is to ensure that\nwhatever schedule you're on makes it\npossible to get enough sleep to stay\nhealthy not getting enough sleep would\nnegatively affect anyone regardless of\nbeing a night owl or an early bird if\nyou're enjoying this video so far don't\nforget to hit that subscribe button\nclick that thumbs up and let's embark on\nan incredible journey of mental health\nand psychology\navoiding the gym I've had multiple gym\nmemberships that I never seem to make it\na constant Habit to be honest I don't\nreally like going it's not that I don't\nwant to exercise it's just that walking\non a treadmill or lifting weights makes\nme feel pretty miserable my boss is all\nabout the Fit Life she starts each day\nwith a two mile run on the treadmill at\nthe gym near her apartment even on\nweekends I've been trying hard to\nimitate her I know it's important to her\nthat we stay on top of our game but what\nif it's just not my style certified\npersonal trainer Paige weiner says when\nit comes to exercising it's important to\nfind your own path you don't have to\njoin a gym to be healthy there are so\nmany options in fact it's a chance to\nget creative what about trying a dance\nclass or playing a game of tennis with a\nfriend you can also go on a hike or try\nmountain biking exercise doesn't have to\nbe boring or monotonous age says find\nwhat you like and forget the rules\nspending the day in bed speaking of\nweekends my bosses are jam-packed she\nreally is a superwoman cars washed\ngroceries bought and house tidied all\nwhile having time to hang out with her\nfriends she does it all and I frequently\nhave days where I stay in bed all day in\nmy PJs literally accomplishing nothing\nnot a dishwashed or a piece of laundry\nsorted pure survival mode LPC Danielle\nyoung says that right now many people\nare living in survival brain more than\nnormal she explains that this can be\nbrought on by things such as changes to\nroutines disconnection from friends and\nfamily loss of loved ones emotions from\ncivil unrest experiences with racism\nbullying and even Financial insecurity\nshe also encourages you to be gentle and\nkind to yourself this isn't failing or\nnot being good enough this is having a\nphysiological experience distress it's\nnormal and it's temporary when I have\ndays like that it isn't that I just\ndon't want to do anything it's the\nthings feel too hard to do it it happens\nwhen I'm struggling getting out of bed\nis a huge achievement on days like that\nbut if I don't it isn't the end of the\nworld I can try again tomorrow surviving\nis not laziness not being busy every\nmoment I'm not booked and busy I have\nthings on my calendar that need to get\naccomplished but there are some Open\nSpaces do I need to be grinding to have\na purposeful life Dr Francine totter\nshares her story saying that when she\nretired the very idea of doing nothing\nwas terrifying and intolerable a\nsituation to be avoided at all cost\nhowever in time she found that taking\ntime every day to do absolutely nothing\nor close to it was good for her\nwell-being she learned that doing\nnothing is an art form it's a practice\nthat has proven mental and physical\nhealth benefits it can lower blood\npressure relax skeletal muscles and\nsharpen Focus all without requiring\nmoney for special products and services\nmaybe it's time for me to stop and think\nabout what being constantly busy\nactually accomplishes are people\ninherently happier over time because\nbecause they have a booked schedule or\nis it the little moments like taking\ntime to look at nature and spending time\nwith loved ones that provide Joy
