    "transcript": "hey psych2goers we're so glad to see you\nhere and we want to thank you for\nsupporting us your ongoing help sharing\nand liking has helped psych2go continue\nour mission to make psychology\naccessible to everyone now let's begin\nshall we\nwhich personality type is prone to\ndepression\nsome people believe that your\npersonality predicts almost everything\nin your life so have you ever wondered\nwhich personality type might be most\nprone to depression well psychology\nresearchers and experts over the years\nhave too a quick disclaimer though\nalthough there are certain personality\ntypes more vulnerable to depression than\nmost research has yet to find a clear\nand concrete association between\npersonality and depression so just\nbecause you do have these certain\npersonality traits doesn't mean that you\nwill develop depression only that you\nmay be at risk of it with that said here\nare some of the personality types found\nto be most prone to depression\nintroversion\naccording to a 2018 article by Neural\nHealth Associates people high in\nintroversion and neuroticism two traits\nfrom the Big Five personality theory are\nmost likely to experience negative\nthoughts introverts in particular had a\ngreater tendency to recall more negative\nevents as found in a study by Dr Floren\ndulcos on top of that introverted men\nwere found to be at higher risk for\ndepression than introverted women\nbecause they tended to not only recall\nmore negative memories but lacked the\nopportunity to express the resulting\nnegative feelings and gain the needed\nsocial support to recover\nexample neuroticism going back to our\nlast Point people who were high in both\nintroversion and neuroticism were also\nfound to be more vulnerable to anxiety\nand depression neuroticism is defined by\nthe National Institute of Health as a\ntrait disposition to experience negative\naffects including anger\nself-consciousness irritability and\nemotional instability this means that\nthose with this personality trait are\nnaturally more emotionally sensitive and\nmore prone to emotional fluctuations\nwhich can make it harder for them to\nbounce back from negative experiences\nfor example they may take breakups\nharder or get discouraged from their\ngoals more easily because of their\noverly emotional nature\nif you find this video relatable and\nhelpful please give the video a thumbs\nup and subscribe to the channel now\nmoving on to the next Point creativity\nand artisticness there are plenty of\nstories about tortured artists who were\nbrilliant masters of their craft but\nstruggled mentally such as Vincent van\nGogh Sylvia Plath and more recently Kurt\nCobain and Robin Williams and true\nenough most creative and artistic types\nhave been found to be more deeply\nemotional ruminative and self-critical\nthe most in an article for the Cambridge\nHandbook of creativity psychology\nprofessors and researchers Paul Sylvia\nand James Kaufman found evidence in\ncurrent research that some domains of\ncreativity for example creative writing\nare indeed associated with some forms of\nMental Illness but especially depression\nand bipolar disorder overachievers and\nperfectionists similar to Artistic types\npeople with an overachieving and\nperfectionist personality type tend to\nbe more self-critical than most which is\nprobably what makes them more prone to\ndepression\naccording to a recent study by Thomas\nCurran assistant professor at the\ndepartment of psychological and\nBehavioral Sciences in London socially\nprescribed perfectionism can be\nespecially debilitating because\nindividuals believe their social context\nis excessively demanding that others\njudge them harshly and that they must\ndisplay Perfection to secure approval\nhis findings report that it's closely\nlinked with anxiety depression and\nsuicidal ideation\nisfps\naccording to a 2009 study by Janowski\nand colleagues of the 16 personality\ntypes described by the mbti the one\nfound to have the highest rates of\ndepression were isfps keep in mind\nhowever that correlation does not imply\ncausation and that the mbti is not\ndesigned to diagnose mental health\nconditions like depression what the\nstudy merely found is that among a\nsample of patients diagnosed with\ndepression the majority of them had an\nintroverted sensing feeling and\nperceiving personality type it's\nimportant to understand that no\nparticular personality type causes\nsomeone to have depression however\nunderstanding which aspects of our\npersonalities may be making us more\nprone or more vulnerable to it may be\nhelpful so if you relate to many of the\npoints we've mentioned here and are\nseriously struggling with
