    "transcript": "- We've all made the mistake\nof saying something bad to someone.\nWe like. Whether it\nsounded better in our head\nor it was a slip of the tongue.\nWe usually don't mean it and\nare embarrassed by our mistake,\nbut sometimes a little\nnegative comment here\nand there isn't as innocent\nas the person saying it\nwould like us to think.\nWhen someone brings you down\nby giving you backhanded\ncompliments, that's called nagging,\nand even though they may think\nit's flirting, it is not.\nSo let's look at the signs\nthat someone is nagging you\nand not flirting.\nNumber one, insults disguised\nas a compliment or joke.\nTeasing is almost necessary\nin the process of flirting.\nIt adds some much needed\nlevity to a relationship\nand can be used to prove whether\nor not someone can laugh at themselves\nor flirt back through.\nTeasing. It's easy to think\nthat someone is teasing you when in\nreality they're nagging you.\nTelling the difference can\nsave you a lot of heartache.\nNagging can instinctually sting\nand is likely to hurt your feelings.\nNagging can come in the form\nof a compliment sandwich\nwhere the person nagging\nyou gives you a compliment,\nfollowed by an insult,\nand then follows that up\nwith another compliment.\nTheir teas might also\nstick with you for longer.\nIt might cause you to question\nsomething about yourself\nor give you a new insecurity.\nThey may say things like,\nwow, you're really pretty.\nFor someone who doesn't wear\nmuch makeup, it's refreshing\nto see natural beauty,\nbut you know you could look\neven better if you put a little\nmore effort into your style.\nAnd when you feel insulted,\nthey may push the blame onto you\nby using phrases like,\ncan't you take a joke?\nAnd of course, I'm just teasing you.\nNumber two, it's becoming familiar.\nAfter a while, you might\nfind yourself expecting their\nbackhanded compliments.\nYou might even make excuses\nfor them brushing it off\nas their way of flirting.\nWhen nagging is ingrained\nin a relationship,\nit can become emotionally\nor verbally abusive.\nIf it isn't already,\nyou may feel like you\ncan't speak out against it\nbecause they'll accuse\nyou of being too sensitive\nor making them feel bad.\nIf you ever feel wrong for\nnot liking the way they flirt\nwith you, they're probably nagging you.\nNumber three, toying with your emotions.\nNagging isn't accidental.\nIt's done to purposefully manipulate.\nWhen we flirt, we want the person we're\nflirting with to feel good.\nFlirting has an emotional goal.\nNagging also has an emotional goal.\nUnfortunately, that goal is usually\nto break your confidence,\nto make you feel worse about yourself so\nthat they seem better.\nIt sounds so obvious\nand villainous when it's\nspoken out like that,\nbut the emotional impact\nthat nagging can have\nshouldn't be underestimated.\nKnowing that the person you\nlike almost likes you can\nbe catastrophic.\nImagine you are head\nover heels for someone\nand they say, I love your hair like that.\nIt makes your forehead seem smaller.\nSure, it sounds like a compliment,\nbut you'll always worry they\ndon't like your forehead.\nThe attraction you might feel\nfor the person nagging you is temporary,\nbut the negative feelings\nyou get from their backhanded\ncompliments will build up.\nIt's extremely unlikely\n- That a relationship built\non nagging will be a happy\nand satisfying one.\nIf you find that you feel less confident,\nthe more time you spend\nwith the person you like,\nthey might be nagging you.\nNumber four, narcissism\noften, but not always.\nNagging is indicative\nof narcissistic traits.\nThis isn't to say that all\npeople who do it are narcissists,\nbut it could be beneficial\nfor you to look out\nfor other narcissistic traits in the\nperson you're floating with.\nIt might feel like the\nperson is always trying\nto make themselves better than you,\nalmost like it's a competition.\nThey might constantly be trying\nto one up you with their nagging.\nThey may also neg you in a way\nthat compares you to others\nor even themselves.\nPay attention to how\ntheir compliments unfold.\nDo they turn the conversation\nback to themselves?\nDo they negatively compare you\nto others when they compliment you?\nNumber five, they think\nthey will stand out\nor seem confident.\nFlirting can be intimidating.\nWe don't always know how we're going\nto get someone's attention\nor if they will even\nrespond to what we say.\nFor some people, the\nsolution is nagging in a\nsea of compliments.\nThe insult is what stands out.\nThat may be what got you interested\nor talking in the first place.\nEspecially if insults can\nbe played off as a joke,\nit might start off as an\nobvious insult, so brazen\nthat it can only be a joke if that's\nhow things began for you.\nIt's very possible that they are\nand have always been nagging you.\nWe can't overstate the negative effects\nthat nagging can have on your self-esteem\nand your relationship.\nAll of the evidence\nsuggests that a relationship\nwith nagging is not a relationship\nanyone should be part of.\nFlirting isn't as ambiguous\nas we might believe.\nSo trust your gut and remember\nthat if someone truly loved\nyou, constructive criticism,\nmean jokes and teasing shouldn't hurt.\nIf this helped you see\nthings a little clearer,\nplease leave a like on the video\nand remember to subscribe to Psych to go\nfor more videos like this.\nYou've got this."
