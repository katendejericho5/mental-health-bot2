    "transcript": "hey psych2goers and welcome back to\nanother video before we start we'd like\nto give you a huge thanks for all of the\nlove and support that you've given us\npsych2go's mission is to make psychology\nmore accessible to everyone and you help\nus do that now let's continue\nmeet Gypsy Rose Blanchard on the surface\nshe was a girl bound to a wheelchair\nsuffering from deadly illnesses in the\ncare of her loving mother\nthings are actually much different than\nseemed behind the curtains there was a\ntragic play one that would eventually\nlead to murder Gypsy was a victim of an\nabusive household her experience offers\nus a glimpse behind the curtains what is\nthe reality of living with an abusive\nparent\nlet's Explore her story\nbeginnings of an illness\nwhen she was only three months old her\nmother Dede began taking her to\nhospitals for checkups and tests\nconvinced that she had sleep apnea even\nthough the results were negative Dede\nrefused to accept that her daughter was\nhealthy as Gypsy grew up her mother\nconvinced her that she suffered from\nvarious illnesses such as leukemia\nmuscular dystrophy intellectual\ndisability seizures and many more She\nalso caused her to undergo unnecessary\nsurgeries and take medication that\ncaused her to lose her teeth a pediatric\nneurologist Bernardo flasterstein\nsuspected that deity was likely\nsuffering from Munchausen by proxy a\nmental disorder where a caregiver feigns\nillness in someone under their care for\nattention and sympathy this disorder\nallowed Dede to gain both attention and\nmonetary gain from the donations she\nreceives as a result of pretending her\nchild was sick and unfortunately it's\nnot uncommon for an untreated mentally\nill parent to become abusive a 2012\nstudy showed that many abusive parents\nexperienced mistreatment during their\nown childhood later on they developed\npersonality disorders and continued the\ncycle of abuse with their own children\naway from a helping hand\nto ensure she had Gypsy under her full\ncontrol Dede kept her far away from her\nfamily's reach she made Gypsy believe\nher father abandoned her that he didn't\ncare about her and was having fun with\nhis new family far away from his\ndaughter in turn this made it easier for\nDidi to manipulate her daughter into\nbelieving her false reality this\nstrategy is often used by abusers in\nabusive relationships domestic violence\nresearcher Claire Murphy wrote on her\nblog that isolation is a pivotal tactic\nused in order to weaken the victims\nprevent them from hearing others\nperspectives and to bring them into line\nwith the abuser's beliefs and\nrequirements abusive parents might turn\ntheir children against other family\nmembers keep them from seeing friends or\neven restrict their phone access the\nfake mask because Gypsy was isolated and\nmanipulated nobody really knew what was\ngoing on in fact when others looked at\nher room all they saw was a loving\nhard-working single mother who gave all\nshe had to help her sick daughter what\nwas actually a selfish Act of abuse on\nthe outside seemed like the most\nselfless kind of love\nDede was hiding behind a mask the same\nmask that abusive parents often wear\naccording to the National Domestic\nViolence Hotline it's common for abusers\nto hide their harmful behaviors in\npublic they play a nice role and act\nlike Saints when other people are around\nbut as soon as they're behind closed\ndoors The Mask slips this in turn makes\nthe victim even more isolated and\nreluctant to seek help too afraid that\nno one would believe them the nightmare\nends in June 2015 Dede tried to make\nGypsy undergo another unnecessary\nsurgery but this time Gypsy was the one\nwho took control when her mother was\nasleep she let her Secret online\nboyfriend Nicholas go to John into her\nhouse and led him to her mother's room\nGypsy hid in the bathroom while Nicholas\nkilled her mother just like that a once\nsick girl got out of her wheelchair\nbecame an accomplice and stepped out of\nthat house forever while gypsy's actions\nwere extreme and unacceptable resulting\nin her being sentenced to 10 years in\nprison we can also acknowledge the dire\ncircumstances she found herself in that\nhighlighted the need for those\nexperiencing abuse to find a way out\nwhile we don't condone what Gypsy did we\ncan use her story to help save others if\nyou're in a situation where your parents\nare abusive please know that it's\npossible to find Freedom it's difficult\nwhen you're young and depend on your\nparents for things like money and\nhousing but one day you'll be able to\nget as far away as you want to even\nhaving no contact if that's what you\nwant you'll start your healing Journey\nfar away from those who hurt you\nmeanwhile please take a look at the\nresources in the description box if\nyou're in need of immediate help\nGypsy is now slowly learning to embrace\nher identity her authentic self free\nfrom her mother's influence as she said\nin an interview with Dr Phil\nmy mother taught me how to be a very\ngood liar and I'm changing that I'm\ntrying to be a good person now I don't\nwant to be like my mother and I'm\nnothing like her let her words remind\nyou that your past does not define you\nyou have the power to continue the story\nyour way\n[Music]\nthank you\nyeah"
