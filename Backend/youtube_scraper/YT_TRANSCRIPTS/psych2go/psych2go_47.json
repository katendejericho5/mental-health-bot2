    "transcript": "- NIE said, what doesn't\nkill you makes you stronger?\nIt's a quote that praises the\nsurvivors of traumatic events\nand argues that people grow\nstronger through adversity.\nHowever, the phrase often dismisses the\nafter effects of the things\nthat don't kill us, such\nas substance abuse, trauma,\nyears of therapy, and more.\nSo in this video we wanna dig deeper\nand argue that what\ndoesn't kill us doesn't\nalways make us stronger.\nTrauma, yes, it's true to some degree\nthat we are made stronger by\nthings that don't kill us.\nWhether it's rock climbing,\nfalling off a bike,\nasking out a crush, or failing a test,\nwe grow stronger with life's hurdles.\nBut what if we go through\nsomething far more painful?\nTraumatic events like\nabuse, neglect, rejection,\ntoxic relationships and bullying\nmay not exactly kill us,\nbut they certainly leave us\nwith scars from\nindescribable, hurt and pain.\nAnd it may result in unhealthy\ncoping mechanisms like\nsubstance abuse or lashing\nout to others just to numb\nor suppress the symptoms of our trauma.\nSo it might not be so simple to say\nthat people are always\nmade stronger by adversity\nbecause we may never know\nthe true impact of the things\nthat don't kill us present.\nImagine that your best friend\ncalled you in the middle\nof the night and they're crying\nbecause they just broke\nup with their partner.\nHow helpful do you think it\nis for you to say, it's okay.\nThis will make you stronger if\nyou haven't noticed already.\nThis statement refuses to be\npresent with those in pain.\nIt rushes people through the\nmoment without allowing them\nto process their emotions.\nIt also doesn't offer compassion\nor empathy when they need it the most show\nbefore you roll up your sleeves\nand jump into, quote this, it's important\nto remain present and compassionate.\nBesides, it may be best\nto let your friend come\nto their own conclusion when they're ready\nand not rush them into it.\nSelf-care. Many of us know firsthand\nthat traumatic events have a\nway of destroying our sense\nof self and distorting our worldview.\nIf left untreated, they can\nalso lead to a lifetime of\nafter effects, including\nPTSD, unhealthy attachments,\nemotional issues, or severe addiction.\nAnd in order to recover\nfrom the effects of trauma,\nit can take long periods of therapy.\nIn short, he's quote,\nfails to mention the time\nand effort it takes to recover\nfrom the effects of trauma.\nWhat he maybe should have\nsaid instead, is that only\nwith proper self-care and treatment,\ndo we have a chance at being made stronger\nfrom the effect of trauma?\nToxic masculinity,\nwhat did the following\nstatements have in common?\nMan up. Walk it off. This will pass.\nWhat doesn't kill you makes you stronger.\nThey often perpetuate toxic masculinity.\nWhile some of them can be\nmotivating under the right\ncontext, statements like\nthese don't really help people\nwho feel crippled by their adversities.\nThey offer no sympathy\nand merely force people\n- To the same thing.\nBottle up your feelings and keep going.\nBut we know that bottling up\nfeelings is never healthy.\nBesides, these statements\noften discourage vulnerability\nbecause it treats\nvulnerability as a weakness.\nBeing vulnerable\nand open about one\nstruggles against things\nthat don't kill us is actually a sign\nof mental strength, not weakness.\nHuman experience.\nThe biggest problem with the quote,\nwhat doesn't kill you\nmakes you stronger is\nthat the statement is reductive.\nIt refuses to acknowledge the uniqueness\nof our individuality\nand reduces us down to one\nsingle statement that all\nof us in every situation are made stronger\nby adversities in life.\nIn short, it oversimplifies\nour human experience.\nAll of us have unique stories,\nand the quote doesn't\nfully encapsulate the parts\nof our lives that aren't\nnecessarily made stronger\nby what doesn't kill us.\nIt can also perpetuate the\nbelief that every single one\nof us experiences the same adversities\nand should come out of\nit exactly the same way.\nUltimately, it's not\nso easy to tell whether\nwhat doesn't kill us\ntruly makes us stronger.\nYes, some adversities do\nhelp us grow stronger.\nOther times we might be left with pain\nthat we may never truly recover from.\nBut the most important part\nis that we should strive\nto acknowledge each\nother's unique experiences\nand adversities.\nIt doesn't hurt to offer\ncompassion to those\nwho are struggling\nthrough their adversities\nbecause not everyone\nwill react the same way.\nAnd what about you? Do\nyou think it's true that\nwhat doesn't kill us makes us stronger?\nTell us in the comments below.\nIf you like this video, don't\nforget to like and subscribe.\nAnd I'll say this, with\nall the love in the world,\nyou matter."
