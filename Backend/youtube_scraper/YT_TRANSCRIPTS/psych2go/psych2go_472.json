content with those who\nneed it children should always expect\nfrom their parents love and care but\nwhat if the parents are toxic\nhow would you feel if I told you that in\n2008 the administration of Children and\nFamilies in the U.S Department of Health\nand Human Services reported that more\nthan 50 000 children were officially\ncounted as victims of emotional abuse\nwhether hurtful words are intended to\ncause pain or not they can leave marks\nand memories from a short time to\nLifetime hurtful remarks can come from\nloved ones such as parents and the\npsychological and emotional damage can\nbe detrimental to a lot of people\nespecially their children\nthe way parents raise their children and\nbehave around them sets up the Basic\nGround which builds their personality\nand self-esteem so how do you know if a\nparent or caretaker is toxic here are\neight things toxic parents say that can\naffect a child's life one offensive\nwords towards their appearance\nyou're ugly too fat too short or too\nskinny or you have ugly hair degrading a\nchild based on their appearance will\nlikely only increase their physical\ninsecurity and worry about their body\nimage this could lead to Serious\nemotional issues such as eating\ndisorders\nparents are supposed to teach their\nchildren how to love themselves no\nmatter how they look on the outside\ntwo\nprovocative questions towards actions\nlike why do you act so weird why do you\nwalk that way chew that way move or talk\nthat way\nchildren tend to believe anything their\nparents say so sarcastic questions or\nremarks like these may make the child\nfeel like there's something wrong with\nthem this makes it very hard for the\nchild to be themselves around people\neven during their adulthood\nand they may then be trapped by the\ndiscomfort and fear That Others May\nlaugh at them or notice the flaws that\ntheir toxic parents made up for them\nthree selfish wishes\nI wish you were never born I wish I had\nan abortion I regret having you I wish\nyou were a different child\nparents should never say something like\nthis to a child it'll make them feel\nlike they weren't supposed to exist in\nthis world in the first place and that\nthey don't deserve to be alive these\nremarks are so harmful to a child to a\nhuman General\nthey diminish their whole sense of\nidentity which can lead to self-harm and\nearly depression instead parents should\nmake them feel loved and valued 4.\nmaking the child feel like a burden\nyou cost me too much money it's so hard\nto take care of you having you exhausts\nme\nif a parent says this to their child the\nchild will feel like a burden it'll\ncause them to unconsciously hide their\nneeds feelings and problems just to\navoid the Wrath of the parent\nconsidering that Nemours a non-profit\nChildren's Healthcare System reported\nthat lack of love and affection are\nmaterialistic things are some of the\ncauses for some children to lean on\nstealing and being abusive 5. unhealthy\ncomparisons\nwhy aren't you like your sibling cousin\nor the other kids the other kids are\nbetter than you\nthis will reduce a child's self-esteem\nsubstantially it makes them think that\nthey'll never be good enough no matter\nhow hard they try\nalso comparing siblings with one another\nonly promotes an unhealthy relationship\nbetween them this will cause them to\nfeel jealousy and resentment towards\neach other siblings should be equally\ngiven the right to build their own\nindependent identities\n6. verbally abusive words or statements\nyou're stupid useless you're a loser or\nyou'll never make it\nabsolute remarks like this will damage\nthe child's self-esteem it's important\nthat parents encourage their children\ninto believing in themselves\nseven\nthreatening abandonment\nI'll leave you I'll put you aside you'll\nwake up and never find me I'll just\ndisappear\nthis will cause the child to have\nabandonment issues fearing that people\nthey love will leave them because of who\nthey are\nwhen a child grows up this belief will\nbe unconsciously ingrained in their mind\nthey'll be unable to trust future\nrelationships for fear of them leaving\nand eight empty promises\nif you do this I'll buy you that or I'll\ntake you there next time but then they\ndon't do it\nwhen a parent makes promises that they\ndon't keep it breaks the child's Trust\nit makes the child feel betrayed\nmaking fake promises is an excellent way\nto teach a child how not to trust others\nin life\nto conclude
