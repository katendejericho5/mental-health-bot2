    "transcript": "- Everyone deserves love\nand we all need it too,\nbut sometimes whether we deserve it\nor not, we just shouldn't be.\nIn a relationship.\nIt might seem fun, important,\nor necessary from the outside,\nbut when you're in a relationship,\nthere are responsibilities\nyou may not be prepared for.\nYou have to consider the mental\nhealth, emotional wellbeing,\nand fulfillment of your partner.\nBeyond that, many people forget that.\nYou have to consider all of\nthese facets for yourself\nas well, so how do we\nknow whether we're ready\nfor that or not?\nHow do you act in your\nother relationships?\nAre you always bumping heads\nwith your friends and family?\nEven if it's not your fault?\nHow do you handle arguments?\nIf you tend to struggle with compromise\nand communication, it could\nforeshadow the downfall\nof your relationship.\nYou might think, well, if I\nreally love them, communication\nand compromise will come easily,\nbut that's not always the case.\nBad communication\nand stubbornness can\nbecome habitual behaviors.\nAccording to a study on human behavior\nand habit forming by social scientist, Dr.\nWanda Yeager, if you typically\ncommunicate in a stubborn\nor abrasive way,\nit could be very difficult\nto break that habit.\nIntroducing someone new\nto your habits, no matter\nhow much you love them,\nwill not break those habits.\nInstead, you can first try\nto improve your communication\nand conflict resolution with\nyour friends and family.\nHow do you feel about yourself?\nDo you know who you want to be?\nAre you trying to fulfill yourself\nor do you think this\nrelationship will fulfill you?\nWorking on yourself means\nmore than just trying\nto be better for other people.\nThe goal of personal growth\nis to become the ideal version\nof yourself where you are\ncomfortable with who you are\nand the path you're on.\nGoing into a relationship\nwith intense insecurities\nand jealousy can be destructive.\nOther examples like aggression\nand manipulation can lead to trauma.\nWe don't all have to be perfect\nto enter a relationship,\nbut we should at least recognize\nour flaws and work on them.\nIf you are relying on this\nperson to fulfill you,\nor if you don't know what\nkind of person you want to be,\nit probably isn't a good\ntime for a relationship.\nDo you know what you want?\nWhat are your plans for the future?\nOutside of this person, it\nprobably isn't a good idea\nto enter a relationship knowing\nit will obstruct the life\nyou want in the future.\nFor example, your partner\nmay be adamant that they want\nto travel the world and vlog for a living,\nbut you are in the middle of\npursuing a career in teaching.\nYour first instinct might be to try\nand fit yourself into that vision,\nbut is it the life you want?\nThis doesn't just apply to careers.\nDo you want children or to\nmove to a different country?\nThese are all huge things to consider\nand compromise can only go so far if you\nor your partner aren't\npursuing the life you want\nbecause one of you had to compromise.\nIt can lead to lifelong resentment,\nso be firm in your goals\nand make sure there's room\nfor someone at your side.\nDo you change to attract people?\nAre you a social chameleon?\nThere's nothing wrong with\nadapting to be more likable,\n- But if you tend to find\nyourself mirroring not only their\nopinions, emotions,\nor even physical habits to the\npoint you grow out of touch\nwith yourself, then maybe you're not ready\nfor a relationship again.\nAgain, it's about pursuing\nlife satisfaction and whether\nor not you and your\npartner can be fulfilled\nin this relationship.\nWhile the social chameleon\neffect can make someone like you\non a temporary superficial level,\nbeing less like yourself\nall the time will build\nresentment in the future.\nUltimately, being authentic\nand embracing your unique self is good\nfor your mental wellbeing\nand the confidence\nand honesty that comes from\nthat can make you more desirable.\nDo you feel pressured?\nAs obvious as it sounds,\nyou shouldn't enter a\nrelationship if you don't want to.\nThere doesn't have to be a reason.\nYou might not have strong enough feelings\nor maybe it's just a gut\nfeeling no matter what.\nIf it feels wrong, don't do it.\nMaybe you have to learn\nabout yourself more, deal\nwith your past experiences\nor focus on your future.\nSometimes you or the person\nyou like just can't be in a\nrelationship and that's okay.\nEven if it feels like\ntime is racing past us,\nit doesn't mean you should\nrush into a relationship.\nWe all need love,\nbut that doesn't have to come in the form\nof a romantic relationship.\nEmbrace your family and your friends,\nand most importantly, embrace yourself.\nYou don't have to be perfect\nor flawless to be in a relationship.\nKeep working on yourself.\nGet used to being yourself\nand love yourself.\nIf you feel like you are\nready for a relationship,\nthat's great, and if\nyou feel like you need\nto give it more time, that's also great.\nIf we've helped you consider\nsome things for your future\nor realize some things about your past,\nlet us know in the comments below.\nRemember to leave a like on\nthe video if you enjoyed it,\nand subscribe to Psych to go\nfor more videos like this.\nYou've got this."
