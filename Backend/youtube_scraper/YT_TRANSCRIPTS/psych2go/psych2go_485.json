    "transcript": "you have started a new relationship and\nyour partner seems perfect they lavish\nyou with gifts stay in touch and profess\ntheir love to you almost daily seems\nlike the start of a fairy tale right\nunfortunately this fairy tale may not be\nall it's cracked up to be the gifts may\nbe getting more expensive the 24 7\ncheck-ins may be becoming increasingly\noverwhelming and your partner never\nreally gives you any space these could\nbe signs that you are being love bombed\nwhat is love bombing licensed counselor\nand professor at Northern Illinois\nUniversity Suzanne decks white describes\nlove bombing as the practice of\noverwhelming someone with signs of\nadoration and attraction which can be\nused to win over your trust and\naffection so that the abuser can meet a\ngoal of theirs being observant and aware\ncan help you avoid being left Bond so\nhere are some telltale signs to look out\nfor it's always your birthday and kinda\ndoes your partner surprise you with\nexpensive gifts and weekend getaways do\nyou feel obligated to accept these gifts\nor go on these trips getting gifts from\na friend or partner is normal for your\nbirthday anniversary or other special\noccasions but when the gifts keep coming\nregularly this may be a sign of Love\nbombing according to the licensed\ntherapy and founder of messy authentic\ncounseling Halen zepianski and when a\npartner gives you gifts that feel over\nthe top and lets you know how expensive\nthey are that's a love bomb think back\nto the last time your grandma or Aunt\ngot you something they brag about how\nthey got it on sale and what a steal it\nwas right this brag of how much they\nspent is their way of saying they love\nyou more because they paid more this is\nalso a manipulative Ploy that creates a\nsense of application in their partner or\nguilts you into staying with them even\nwhen the relationship takes a turn for\nthe worse the textaholic does your\npartner bombard you daily with texts and\ncalls saying how much they love you and\nget mad when you fail to respond\nimmediately do they need to know where\nyou are at all times as a licensed\nmarriage and family therapist Dr Amy e\nKeller points out it feels great when a\nnew potential love interest starts\nsexting you or bombards you with texts\ncalls and flowers but one texts and\ncalls become increasingly overwhelming\nthat's a red flag in her previously\nmentioned article Dex White advises\nreaders to be on the lookout for text\nmessages that increase in frequency or\nintensity because these are often\ndesigned to manipulate you into spending\nmore time with the love bomber and less\ntime with friends family and yourself\nnow keep in mind this is different for\nevery couple some couples can talk and\ntext all day then be with each other all\nnight which works for them it's only\nlove bombing when you are not\ncomfortable with a high level of\ncommunication the Katy Perry does anyone\nremember that 2008 Katy Perry song Hot\nand Cold well that song is literally at\nthis sign does your partner compliment\nyou and then criticize you within\nseconds of each other do they have a way\nof lifting you up and then bringing you\nright back down board certified\npsychiatrist Dr Dale Archer says that\nlove bombers are experts at detecting\nlow self-esteem and exploiting often to\nfeel better about themselves like\nemotional vampires according to the\ndictionary of U.S domestic shelters the\nkey to spot left bombing is noticing\nthat things are uncomfortably intense\nconsistently sometimes to the point of\nfear if you're afraid of what will\nhappen if you ask to slow down or if you\nend things this might be a sign they're\nlove bombing you why aren't you paying\nattention to me uh does your partner\ndemand you love them above everyone else\ndo they purposefully try to separate you\nfrom your family and friends and want\nyour undivided attention licensed\ncounselor and doctor of Behavioral\nHealth at Banner Behavioral Health\nHospital Jeremiah fox says love bombers\nwill demand your attention and time\nignoring your time and schedule they may\nisolate you from family and friends and\nmay become angry or make you feel guilty\nwhen you make plans with others imagine\nit's Friday night and it's one of your\nclosest friends birthday dinner but your\npartner asks if you want to grab dinner\nand catch a movie when you politely let\nthem know you already have plans they\nget very angry at you and say things\nlike I see if I ask you to hang out\nagain or maybe I'll just go out alone\nand find someone else to find dinner\nwith license counselor Tabitha Westbrook\nput it best true love does not want all\nyour time and energy focused on them\nlove bombers do this to gain control if\nyour partner truly loves you they will\nrespect other commitments ideas and\nboundaries that doesn't work for me\nlook no one is perfect and we all have\nour own red flags when you're in a\nrelationship you might notice some of\nyour partner's red flags which could\nturn into problems if not addressed when\nyou address any issues and set healthy\nboundaries with your partner what\nhappens do they respect you and the\nboundaries or do they turn into the Hulk\non a really bad day according to Fox\nlove bombers get set off easily and\nbecome defensive or abusive if\ncriticized or challenged they may become\nviolent if they don't get their way they\nmay use controlling tactics like\ngaslighting to control their partners\nand reduce restrictions they'll\ntypically guilt-trip their partners and\npaint themselves as victims because they\nwant complete control and easy access to\ntheir Partners but establishing\nboundaries is a part of any healthy\nrelationship according to Westbrook love\nbombers get upset about any boundaries\nthat restrict access to you or you\naccepting their displays of love it's\nlike a tsunami of affection and they\nexpect you to accept it all at once no\nbreathing space copious amounts of gifts\nyour phone is going off when you're not\nwith them and when you're not in school\nor work you're expected to be with them\nif you feel overwhelmed it's normal it\ncan be hard to say no to the person we\nlove and even harder to recognize when\nthat person is not right for us but if\nyou are constantly feeling overwhelmed\nor anxious with your partner present\nthen maybe time to move on Archer says\nthat love bombing works because humans\nhave a natural need to feel good about\nwho we are and often we can't fill this\nneed on our own that's why giving\nyourself space and trusting your\nintuition is so important yes love\nbombing works because we often need\nothers to feel validated but that's why\nit's so important to remind yourself\nthat you are valid with or without\nanyone else telling you so a small part\nof us wants to be showered with love and\naffection from time to time but when\nthat adoration turns into a 24 7 show\nthat can make things toxic or dangerous\npretty fast do you recognize these signs\nfrom a previous or current relationship\ndo you know someone who may be being\nlove bombed Westbrook says it's\nimportant to be attuned to your\nintuition so you can be informed instead\nof being Carried Away by love bombing\ntactics if your intuition tells you\nsomething is wrong in your relationship\nplease consider reaching out to a\nprofessional or loved one you trust\nthanks so much for watching and don't\nforget to like And subscribe and we'll\nsee you next
