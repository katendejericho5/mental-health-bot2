to make psychology\nmore accessible to everyone and you help\nus do that now let's continue Hollywood\nmarketing companies have a lot of people\nchasing after love like it's a prize or\na status symbol but what's the big deal\nwith relationships do you need a New\nYear's kiss or a valentine are\nrelationships overrated maybe not for\neveryone but there definitely are some\nbenefits to being single relationships\ncan be wonderful but being single can\ntoo you don't have to be bitter and\nlonely let's take a look at a few of the\nbenefits of being single\nstrengthening bonds according to\nMaslow's hierarchy of needs something we\nall want is love and belonging we want\nto be loved unconditionally we want\nsomeone who we can talk to about\nanything a lot of the time especially as\nwe get older that Gap seems to become\nmore obvious and we tend to think that\nthe thing that's missing is romantic\nlove\nbecause of that we lose sight of the\nfact that we can receive love and\naffection from many sources not just a\nromantic partner\nstudy conducted in 2016 revealed that\nreceiving support from other sources\nlike your friends and family can\nmitigate feelings of romantic loneliness\nin other words spending time with\nfriends and family can keep that nagging\nfeeling that something is missing away\npermission to be selfish a 2013 article\npublished in politics philosophy and\neconomics titled in a compromise be fair\nstates that compromises need to occur in\nrelationships even at the cost of\nfairness this means compromises aren't\nalways fair but they are necessary for a\nrelationship to work\nthat's good news for single people of\ncourse compromises will still come up as\nyou balance work or school friends and\nfamily but the most stressful and\ntime-consuming compromises come with\nbeing in a relationship you don't need\nto discuss plans of a significant other\nyou can just decide on things yourself\nyou don't need to compromise\nfeel like training yourself to Sushi in\na movie on a lovely Sunday afternoon you\ncan that includes not worrying about the\noption needs or wants that a significant\nother would have no worrying that\nthey're not in the mood for sushi or\nthat they don't want to see the movie\nyou picked it's the one time aside from\nyour birthday that you can be a little\nmore selfish than usual\nlook Within\nwhen you're single and don't have to\ncompromise you have more time to\ndiscover the things that make you you\nwhether you like to spend entire days\nplaying video games or watching Niche\nfilms that make other people's squeamish\nyou can do whatever tickles your fancy\nwhen you aren't in a relationship this\nalso extends to introspection you have\ntime to look in words and learn about\nyourself you can figure out everything\nthat you need and want in life you'll\nalso have time to recognize and heal\npast trauma when you're in a\nrelationship your goals need to fit into\nthe relationship or a compromise needs\nto be met you shouldn't have to\ncompromise on your dreams and the things\nthat you're most passionate about\nin a thesis written in 2019 titled\nseeking Solitude the positive effects of\nbeing alone\nPhD candidate Samantha Voss wrote being\nan uninterrupted silence gets you\ninvolved in your own emotions and\nthoughts\nyou get to really understand them create\nan inward awareness that helps you\nimprove your outward awareness and that\nsums it up perfectly\nMental Health\nexistentialist philosopher Jean-Paul\nSartre has a famous quote that says\nif you're lonely when you're alone\nyou're in Bad Company\nbeing in a relationship shouldn't\nnegatively affect your mental health but\nit can this also goes for being single\nbut when you're single you can choose\nthat alone time for your mental health\nwhenever you need it a few Studies have\nbeen done on the effects of a\nrelationship on your mental health\nclinical psychologist Scott braithwyd\nfound that improving your relationship\ncan improve your mental health but\nimproving your mental health won't\nnecessarily improve your relationships\nthis suggests that if you have mental\nhealth issues now getting into a\nrelationship isn't a way to solve these\nissues\naccording to psychologist Adele fourth\nthere is a possibility that your\nrelationship can lead to trauma if your\npartner is or becomes abusive that\nshouldn't be something you have to worry\nabout\nwhile you're single take time to\nappreciate your own company and make\nsure your mental space is healthy use\nthis time to care for yourself do a face\nmask work out or watch some trash TV\ntreat yourself well you can always\nexperience romance on your own through a\nsolo date unlike Lady Gaga\nyou don't want a bad romance\nrelationships can be wonderful but if\nyou're waiting for the one not\ninterested in relationships or you've\njust left a relationship just know\nthere's a lot to enjoy in the single\nlife\nlet us know how the single life is\ntreating you in the comments leave a\nlike And subscribe to psych2go for more\nvideos like this and if we can leave you\nwith one thing it's
