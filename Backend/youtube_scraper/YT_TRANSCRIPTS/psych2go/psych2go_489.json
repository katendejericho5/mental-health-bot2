may\nrealize are some symptoms of inattentive\nADHD her vulnerability bravery and\nloyalty led to the affection of Hermione\nRon Harry and plenty of potterheads and\nMongols around the world unfortunately\nmany women often don't get the same type\nof support and recognition she did\naccording to numerous studies plenty of\nwomen lived their lives with undiagnosed\nADHD this leads to numerous problems\nstarting with damaging effects on\nwomen's health mental health and\nwell-being\nthrough research we have discovered that\nthere are layers to this issue so in\ntoday's video Let's dive deep into the\ntopic of undiagnosed ADHD in women watch\nuntil the end to discover the ADHD\nsymptom checklist for adult women\nlet's start with the numbers we\nmentioned that plenty of women live with\nundiagnosed ADHD exactly how many women\nare we talking about four years ago\naccording to ADHD by the Numbers facts\nstatistics and You by Kimberly Holland\nmales were already three times more\nlikely to be diagnosed with ADHD\nover the years the numbers increased in\nJune 2022 an ADHD and women article by\nDenise broadly revealed that instead of\nthree men in the U.S are now four times\nmore likely to be diagnosed with a\ndisorder in other countries cases of\nwomen with ADHD may appear to be lower\nin number but this is likely due to\nwomen and girls not being included in\nthe research methodology according to\nthe American Journal of psychiatry by\nnow you may be noticing the ongoing\npattern why is there such a discrepancy\nbetween the two sexes\nlet's find out next\nmisdiagnosis and under treatment did you\nknow that the diagnostic criteria for\nADHD will more likely identify ADHD in\nboys rather than girls this is one\ninteresting piece of information that\nisn't discussed much according to Dr\nKathleen Nadia who specializes in the\npsychological treatment of women and\ngirls is because the criteria was mainly\ndeveloped through observing boys to back\nthis up a 2020 study from the University\nof Groningen in the Netherlands\nconcluded that there are hardly any\ninvestigations about the varying effects\nof ADHD drug medications on different\nsexes\nfor decades women have been excluded\nfrom numerous research and discussions\ndue to this they are consistently under\ntreated if you're learning a lot from\nthis video please don't forget to hit\nthe like button your support means a lot\nto us now let's proceed to the impact\none may argue that ADHD is more severe\nin women than it is in men let's take a\nlook at different factors to understand\nwhy\nthe hormonal effects earlier we\nmentioned that fluctuations in women's\nhormones intensify ADHD symptoms let's\nhave menopause as an example according\nto Laura McCarthy writer of women\nhormones and ADHD around menopause\nwomen's estrogen levels drop about 65\npercent causing a decrease in serotonin\nand dopamine also known as the happy\nhormones when this happens the already\napparent symptoms of irritability\nfatigue and memory lapses become even\nmore pronounced causing difficulty for\nwomen to concentrate and make rational\ndecisions\nthe social effects it's no secret that\nwomen have complex social roles in\nsociety traditional gender roles dictate\nthat women are generally encouraged to\ndisplay emotions be nurturing stay\naccommodating and remain polite this can\ngenerate an unhealthy amount of pressure\nfor them to act a certain way even if\nthey're not inclined to do so for\nexample since an attentive ADHD is more\ncommon in women they may overwork to\nhide the symptoms of forgetfulness and\ndistractibility in order to not be\ndeemed lazy\nwithout a proper diagnosis you can\nimagine how these unexplained symptoms\nmay cause marriage difficulties\nrelationship conflicts dating struggles\nand troublemaking friends all of these\nnot only negatively impact women's\nquality of life but also the state of\ntheir mental health too trigger warning\nthe next Point may be triggering to\nthose who are sensitive to suicide and\nself-harm topics please proceed with\ncaution you can go straight to this time\nstamp to skip this part\nthe mental health impact\nafter the previous point it's not\ndifficult to imagine that due to social\npressures women may get a tendency to\ninternalize their ADHD symptoms rather\nthan seek help the current lack of\nunderstanding of ADHD in women likely\ncontributes to a societal climate that\nmakes women feel anxious and doubtful of\ntheir own condition\nsadly this isn't even the worst part\nmost alarmingly girls and women with\nADHD have been shown to be at higher\nrisk of self-harm than women without the\ndisorder the Berkeley girls in ADHD\nlongitudinal study bgals began in the\nmid-1990s and continuously examines 140\ngirls diagnosed with ADHD during\nchildhood after 10 years the girls with\nADHD diagnosis were twice as likely to\nreport self-harming behaviors like\ncutting and three times as likely to\nhave made a serious suicide attempt\naccording to childbind Institute not\nonly that in the book understanding\ngirls with ADHD Dr Ellen Littman states\nthat since girls tend to hold all these\nnegative feelings of anxiety fear and\nfrustration in nobody is usually aware\nof what they're going through until it's\ntoo late it becomes a lifelong struggle\nthat starts from childhood extends to\nWomanhood and may even get worse in\nolder adult years\nit's truly heartbreaking the girls and\nwomen all over the world are\nexperiencing this our
