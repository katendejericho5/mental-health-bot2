    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhen we go through a traumatic\nexperience it can take significant time\nand effort to heal and move on from it\nand sometimes even when we think we're\nfinally okay trauma can still linger in\nways we don't realize and leave us with\npsychological wounds that can be\ntriggered in certain situations mental\nhealth care nurse Stephanie a Wright\ndefines trauma triggers as any stimulus\nthat reminds us of a past trauma and\nelicits a strong emotional or a\nbehavioral reaction that may make us\nfeel as if we're reliving that trauma\nall over again\nthese triggers are unique to every\nindividual and may not always be easy\nfor us to recognize says right with that\nsaid here are five psychology-backed\nsigns that your trauma wound is\ntriggered according to experts\nintrusive thoughts according to\ncognitive behavioral therapist Dr Seth J\ngillahan it's common for people with\ntrauma to have intrusive thoughts most\noften these thoughts are associated with\nmemories of the trauma that they will\nactively try to block out from their\nminds only for it to return over and\nover again replaying in their heads as\nif on a loop having intrusive thoughts\ncan be upsetting but it's also a cry for\nhelp from your subconscious to work\nthrough your unhealed trauma\nnightmares insomnia another Telltale\nsign that your trauma wound is triggered\nis when you have trouble sleeping either\nbecause of insomnia or bad dreams this\nis because nightmares are another way\nour minds try to tell us that we're\nstill hurting from our past trauma and\nuntil we process it fully we're likely\nto re-experience it in our dreams when\nour subconscious mind takes over and we\nmay have difficulty sleeping says\nneuropsychologist Dr Michelle Carr\nemotional outbursts\naside from these cognitive effects we've\nmentioned there are also effective\nmanifestations of a trigger trauma wound\nsuch as difficulty regulating one's\nemotions according to Dr gillihan's\nstrong feelings of fear anxiety and\nanger are very common reactions to\ntrauma and sometimes these feelings can\nbe so overwhelming that they may result\nin intense emotional outbursts like\ngetting upset and snapping at people\nover even the littlest things people who\nhave experienced trauma may also become\nmore irritable and on edge long after\nthe trauma-inducing event is over but\nthey may not always know why if you find\nthis video relatable and helpful please\ngive the video a thumbs up and subscribe\nto the channel now moving on to the next\nPoint hyper vigilance\nwhen something triggers our trauma wound\nlike an uncomfortable situation or a\nconflict with a loved one for example we\nmay begin to feel constantly on guard\nand Hyper Vigilant says Dr Matthew tall\nprofessor of psychology and clinical\nresearchers specializing in anxiety and\nPTSD we may find it difficult to relax\nbecome more alert and aware of our\nsurroundings and avoid anything that\nmakes us feel even the slightest bit\nthreatened or uneasy sometimes this may\neven manifest as physical symptoms of\nsweaty Palms raising heartbeat and\nclenched jaw and muscle tension\naccording to Dr Tull this is because we\nwant to avoid getting hurt again and\ndon't want to be caught off guard as\ndrama has made us distrust both\nourselves and those around us and view\nthe world as a dangerous place\nguilt and self-loathing it's common to\nfeel guilty after we experience a\ntraumatic event says Dr Gillian and many\nwill often ask themselves if there was\nmore they could have done to avoid it\nbut fixating on these thoughts and\nruminating too much on negative feelings\ncan make us see ourselves as weak and\ninadequate and blame ourselves for what\nwe went through\nwhich is why victims of trauma can\nsometimes develop depression because of\nthe emotional toll trauma can take on\nour self-esteem\nas with most trauma-related beliefs\nexplains Dr Gillihan we are often more\ncritical of ourselves in hindsight and\nfeel unnecessary guilt and self-loathing\nabout our traumatic past it's a\nmaladaptive self-protective effort to\navoid traumatic experiences in the\nfuture and to try to make sense of what\nhappened to us in the past\nso what are your thoughts on this video\ndo any of the things we've talked about\nhere resonate with you they do for me\nit's important to keep in mind that\nalthough trauma can negatively impact Us\nin lasting and recurring ways there's\nstill hope for us to overcome it and\nheal the wounds it's left us with\ntrauma-informed care can help us live\nhappier and more fulfilling lives\nunconstrained by a dramatic past so\ndon't hesitate to talk to someone about\nit or reach out to a mental health
