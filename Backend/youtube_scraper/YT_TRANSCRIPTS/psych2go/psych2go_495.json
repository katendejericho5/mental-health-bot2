    "transcript": "[Music]\nhave you been dreading the proverbial\nfirst date has it been a while since\nyou've been out for a night on the town\nespecially with someone you really\nreally like are you scared of all the\nthings that could possibly go wrong you\nwant to give off the right impression\nand hopefully get to that all-important\nsecond date this sounds rather difficult\nto achieve but it's actually not don't\nworry we've got you covered here are six\ncommon first date mistakes and more\nimportantly how to avoid them number one\nover or underdressing how do you dress\non a first date do you overthink things\nor do you not plan enough in advance\nthis one can be pretty tough to navigate\nas a first date you probably don't know\neach other all too well first\nimpressions aren't everything but they\nare very important you don't want to\nshow up with the nicest outfit you have\nbecause it may come off like your trying\ntoo hard if your data is dressed\ncomparatively less fancy than you they\nmay be made to feel worse about\nthemselves you also don't want to\nunderdress and come off too casually if\nyou show up in your workout clothes for\ninstance your date may think that you're\nnot taking them seriously try a happy\nmedium of casual mixed with fancy find a\nsweet spot that both looks good but it's\nalso still comfy and choose something\nthat makes you feel confident and true\nto yourself number two showing up late\nhow do you feel when someone shows up\nlate to meet you think back to a time\nwhen someone kept you waiting doesn't\nfeel too good huh now imagine that was\nyour first impression of them do you\nshow up late often nobody likes to be\nkept waiting if you show up late to the\ndate that's special someone won't think\nthey're very special anymore even when\nyou do finally show up with the best\nexcuse in the World whether it's true or\nnot it won't matter to them your date\nwill feel like their time doesn't matter\nto you this will automatically start the\nnight off on the wrong foot you'll be\nfighting an uphill battle the entire\ntime one you most likely won't win to\navoid this you can do some healthy\nplanning in advance knowing when the\ndate is supposed to start you'll want to\nfigure out the best way to get there\nwhether that's taking a car the bus or\neven walking maybe you're a bicycle\nEnthusiast which isn't a bad thing but\nthat physical exertion may cause you to\nsweat through your fine clothes worst of\nall your stench will proceed you give\nyourself ample time to get to the\nlocation in question while being relaxed\nand ready if you find this video\nrelatable and helpful please give the\nvideo a thumbs up and subscribe to the\nchannel now moving on to the next Point\nnumber three complaining about the\nservice how do you feel when someone\ncontinuously complains about the service\nat a restaurant complaining about the\nservice is a Surefire way of having your\nday to be entirely unimpressed with you\nfor the service industry is one of the\ntoughest industries that you can ever\nwork in if you're at a restaurant for\ndinner and they're in the middle of a\nbig crazy Rush your server may not be\naround as much as you may like\nbad-mouthing other people that are\nworking hard and doing their best to\nplease you will likely be a quick turn\noff for your date if you're able to have\npatience with slower than desired\nservice your date will see your\nempathetic side if you can show patience\nthey may feel more comfortable around\nyou because you'll come off as more\nlikely to be patient with them later on\ndown the line remember to always tip\nyour service you don't want to end up\nbeing like Mr Pink in Reservoir Dogs\nnumber four bringing up your exes have\nyou ever been on a first date with\nsomeone who brought up their EX too soon\nthis is a big red flag along with\ncomplaining about the service talking\nabout your exes on a first date may just\nmake your date go to the bathroom only\nto never come back many of us have\nbaggage it's very likely that your date\nthemselves has baggage coming into this\nfirst date too the problem with bringing\nup your exes this soon could potentially\nmake them think you're not over the past\nyour date won't want to compete with\nother people you've dated before if you\nend up fully dating this person in the\nfuture when things are more certain and\nyou're both more comfortable with each\nother then it would probably be okay to\nbring up your past until then do your\nbest to keep things going positively in\nthe present if the person agreed to go\non a date with you in the first place\nit's because they like you for the\nperson you are today\nnumber five talking about your finishes\nto be clear there's no King shaming to\nbe had here as long as the acts are\nconsensual between the parties involved\npeople should be able to like what it is\nthat they like that being said talking\nabout your favorite fetish between\nbuttering bread may not be the best\napproach if you're lucky your date may\nhave similar sexual tastes as you in\nthat case whew you really dodged an\nawkward bullet there if you're not so\nlucky and your Kink is eternal for your\ndate it could be pretty difficult to\nsalvage the impending awkwardness if the\ndates gone well you may feel emboldened\nto open up about these types of intimate\nthings it's probably best to play it\nsafe and hold that card close to your\nchest until a later date maybe date five\nnumber six making the other person pay\nfor you nobody likes a cheapskate if you\ninsist your date pays for you several\nthoughts will likely run through their\nmind at super speed can you not afford\nto take them out on other dates can you\nafford to pay your bills are you\nresponsible with your money if you're on\na date with a person who agrees in being\nequal they may offer to split the Bell\nit's always kind when someone offers to\npay for you as well these are both good\nways to know what kind of person they\nare in return have you made any of these\ncommon mistakes before on a first date\nfeel free to share your experiences in\nthe comments down below First Dates can\nbe super exciting just as much as they\ncan be totally terrifying hopefully this\nlist can give you a good idea of the\nmistakes and pitfalls that many people\nhave made before you if you find\nyourself having done any of these in the\npast you're not the only one they're\ncommon for a reason and thankfully\neasily avoidable give the first date\nyour best shot and if it doesn't go well\nyou can always go on another first date\nwith someone else if you enjoyed this\nvideo feel free to leave a like and\nshare it with a friend subscribe to\npsych2go for more content
