    "transcript": "- Have you ever thought\nsomething was normal only\nto realize it wasn't,\nor that someone\nwho should seem perfectly\nfriendly was making you\nfeel uncomfortable?\nIf these are things you\nfelt in your childhood\nor you're still a minor\nand are currently feeling\nabout an adult in your life,\nit may be your intuition's\nway of warning you.\nOtherwise, if you're simply curious\nand wanna educate yourself about grooming\nor worry that someone\nyou know might be going\nthrough it, you're in the right place.\nGrooming is the manipulative\nprocess of normalizing sexual\nand inappropriate behavior\nbetween minors and adults.\nIt allows the adult to suddenly\nor overtly assert inappropriate control\nand power over the child in which the\nultimate goal is abuse.\nIt can happen to anyone regardless\nof gender or background.\nThe groomer may be a family\nmember, friend, or professional.\nIt's a chilling reality,\nbut understanding its stages\nand recognizing its signs is crucial\nfor safeguarding ourselves\nand our loved ones.\nWith that said, here are seven\nwarning signs of grooming\nto be on the lookout for\naccording to experts.\nA quick note before we\ncontinue accusing someone\nof grooming holds serious\nconsequences, so it's important\nto approach these situations\nwith care and consideration.\nSpeaking out against grooming is crucial,\nbut it's also important to\nacknowledge the nuances in\ndifferent relationships and contexts.\nFor instance, a close family\nmember may displace some\nof these signs without malicious intent.\nHowever, if someone exhibits\nmore than four signs\nconsistently, it's highly\nprobable they are a groomer.\nRemember to always trust your\nintuition. Excessive secrecy.\nIs there an older person\nin your life that messages\nor calls you often, but asks\nyou to keep it a secret?\nDo they call you their friend\nor maybe more in private,\nbut then act like strangers\nwith you in public?\nGroomers rely on secrecy\nto maintain control over their victims\nand avoid scrutiny from others.\nThey might pressure you into\nkeeping your interactions\nwith them private, using excuses like\nour relationship is special\nand others wouldn't understand,\nor it's our little secret.\nOtherwise, they risk exposing\ntheir true intentions\nand manipulative tactics.\nUnexplained gifts while receiving gifts\nor favors from someone can feel nice,\nbe cautious if their gestures\ncome with hidden expectations.\nAttached groomers may use gifts\nand favors as a way to create\na sense of indebtedness\nand make it harder for you to say no\nwhen they ask for favors.\nThis might also be a tactic\nfrom them to gain your trust\nand get you to lower your guard with them\nby making you like them more\nspecial treatment or attention.\nEver had a teacher give\nyou special treatment\nor felt that they were\noverly interested in you?\nBe careful not to let it get to your head.\nGroomers know just how to stroke your ego,\nmaking you feel like the most\nspecial person in the room.\nBut here's the catch. This\nspecial treatment isn't about\nmaking you feel good.\nIt's about gaining your trust\nand dependence so they can\ncontrol and exploit you.\nSpending time alone. Beware\n- Of adults who insist\non spending excessive\none-on-one time with you.\nPredators often seek opportunities\nto isolate their targets away from the\nwatchful eyes of others.\nThis could mean insisting on spending time\nwith you away from friends, family,\nor trusted individuals, or instance.\nA coach who constantly offers\nprivate training sessions\noutside of regular practice hours,\nmight be crossing boundaries\ninto potentially dangerous\nterritory, allowing things\nyour parents forbid.\nSay your parents forbid you\nfrom going out past midnight\nor watching graphic movies,\nbut you had an adult friend\nwho'd let you get away with it.\nThey'd probably seem\nreally cool to you, right?\nBut it's actually a major red\nflag when someone encourages\nyou to engage in activities\nor behaviors that your parents\nhave expressly forbidden.\nThey do this not only to gain your trust,\nbut also to undermine\nyour parents' authority\nand coax you into doing more\nand more dangerous things\nlike smoking, drinking,\nor having sex.\nInstead, respectful individuals\nwill honor your family's\nrules and boundaries rather\nthan encourage you to defy them.\nExcessive physical touching.\nPay attention to how someone\nrespects your personal\nboundaries and comfort\nlevel with physical contact.\nAre they constantly trying\nto get in your personal space\nor touch you without permission?\nMaybe they pass it off as a friendly hug,\nan accidental touch, or something\nlike a shoulder massage.\nNo matter how harmless\nit might seem at first,\ngroomers will always try\nto escalate these types\nof behaviors to sexualize\nyour relationship\nand maybe even use your\nnatural curiosity against you.\nFor example, they might\nproposition you with things like,\ndo you need someone to\nteach you how to kiss?\nLet's practice. Then\nminimizing others' concerns.\nIf anyone else has ever\nexpressed concern about your\nrelationship with an older friend\nor relative, a groomer\nwill always try to downplay\nor dismiss their concerns.\nThey don't know what\nthey're talking about,\nor everyone else is just so\njudgmental and malicious.\nThey'll probably try to convince you\nthat those other people\nare just overreacting\nor misunderstanding things between you\nor even gaslight you into\nquestioning your own instincts.\nAnd maybe you're right,\nthis is wrong. Oh, what?\nSo you're on their side now.\nWhen did you become so\nchildish and uncool?\nI thought we were\nfriends. That's grooming.\nGrooming is a complex\nand insidious process,\nbut awareness is your\nfirst line of defense,\nand by educating yourself\non the common tactics\nand warning signs, you'll be better able\nto protect yourself and your loved ones.\nIf something feels off or\nuncomfortable, don't ignore it.\nEstablish clear boundaries\nin your relationships, even\nwith adults, and don't\nhesitate to speak out.\nIf you witness grooming behavior\nor suspect someone is being targeted,\nyour voice can make a\ndifference in preventing harm.\nIf you found this video\nvaluable, please like\nand share to spread awareness.\nComment your stories\nand insights down below,\nand subscribe to our channel\nfor more insightful content\nlike exploring untold Trauma,\nthe dark side of kids tv,\nand six, dark psychology\ntricks to be aware of.\nThanks for watching."
