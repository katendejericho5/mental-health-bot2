    "transcript": "have you been feeling really anxious\nlately\naccording to a March 2022 survey by the\nAmerican Psychological Association\n87 agreed that there has been a constant\nstream of Crisis over the last two years\nit also showed that stress grief and\nunhealthy coping are at historic levels\nso to help you navigate this chaotic\nWorld here are five pieces of Life\nadvice you need to know\nnumber one acknowledge that the struggle\nis real you feel overwhelmed and\nblindsided by everything that's\nhappening experts often call these\nsituations buca\nvolatile since everything is changing\nfaster than you can manage uncertain\nbecause understanding and predicting\nevents are impossible so everything hits\nyou as a surprise\ncomplex as there are many forces and\nissues mixed up together that there's no\nclear cause and effect\nambiguous since what is happening and\nwhat might happen next can't always be\ndescribed or interpreted with confidence\nresearch suggests that when the Mind\ndetects a prolonged generalized sense of\nunsafety it reverts to a chronic stress\nresponse which can form a major health\nrisk this is most often triggered when\nuncertainty overwhelms everything in\nyour life including situations you once\nconsidered ordinary\nand when your social network becomes\ncompromised so when you constantly worry\nabout the past or future lose sleep or\nfeel emotionally drained remember that\nit's not just you and it's not just in\nyour head the struggle is real\nnumber two\navoid unhealthy coping\nhow do you respond when life gets\noverwhelming if you're like most people\nyou'll probably avoid risk and ambiguity\nby doubling down on familiar routines\ndecisions and habits but these might not\nbe reliable or healthy Comfort eating\nand drinking are on the rise but these\ncan lead to unhealthy weight gain and\nalcoholism which may end up just\nworsening your feeling of stress and\nlead you into a never-ending vicious\ncycle according to a review of mental\nhealth over the past few years published\nin American psychologist even subtle\ncoping behaviors like denial blame\nventing and self-distraction are\nunhealthy and have been linked to higher\nlevels of general anxiety and depression\nso the next time you're tempted to cope\nin these unhealthy ways remember that\neven if they may seem like the easy way\nout they're only going to make you feel\nworse number three Embrace uncertainty\nparadoxically the best way to respond to\nfuka is to embrace uncertainty in\nPsychology we use a tool called the\nJahari window to clarify our knowledge\nit's divided into four sections things\nthat everyone knows things that are\nknown to the self but not others things\nthat are known to others but not the\nself and things that are unknown to\neveryone usually these quadrants are\nequally sized but psychologist Susanna\nwuppan Calvert has a radical suggestion\nby redrawing the Jahari window so that\nthe unknown is by far the biggest\nquadrant you come to realize that\nuncertainty is always a core part of\nyour reality and that fighting it is a\nlost cause uncertainty is a constant\nfeature of life that you should learn to\nbe okay with experiencing not an\ninterest of enemy that you need to fight\noff so the next time you feel anxious\nbecause you can't anticipate understand\nor control something in your life\ntry to accept that you don't need to do\nthose things to thrive and try to\ntolerate uncertainty as a familiar\nfriend\nnumber four\nground yourself\npresent\nare you always thinking of the past or\nworrying about the future in moments\nlike these it's good to learn to be\npresent if you can ground yourself and\nthrive in the present you can Thrive at\nany time\nas life is just a series of present\nmoments you could go for a walk and\ncount your steps take deep breaths and\ncount them eat something slowly and\nSavor the flavor or listen to everything\naround you and focus on all the sounds\nlike grounding yourself in the present\ndistressing thoughts about the world of\nthe past and the future will fade away\nand your inner voice will become clearer\nso the next time your mind wanders to\nworries elsewhere take the opportunity\nto embrace the safety and joy of the\npresent moment\nnumber five be open to learning and\nReinventing yourself what do you tend to\ndo when you're faced with a challenge do\nyou run away or Embrace a change\naccording to organizational psychologist\nMichael Woodward individuals who Thrive\nbest in fuka are the ones who treat new\nexperiences as opportunities are open to\nchange and are completely flexible\ninstead of treating the unknown as a\nsource of fear and clinging to your\ncomfort zone commit to trying new ways\nto live your life try out new hobbies\nmeet new friends or go to different\nlocations as Woodward quoted\nwhat got you here won't get you there in\nthe future everything you consider\ncertain in life may be fleeting and you\nmay need to reinvent yourself\nbut this doesn't have to be scary as\nlong as you consider that you are in\ncontrol of your response rather than the\nworld unfairly forcing you to change\nso the next time something unexpected is\nthrown your way grasp it as an\nopportunity for growth learning and\ninsight\ndo you think you can use these tips\nmentioned in this video let us know in\nthe
