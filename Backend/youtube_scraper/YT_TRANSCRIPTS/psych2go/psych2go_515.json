    "transcript": "[Music]\nwhat do you find attractive a certain\nhair color body type or facial feature\nbut it's not really your opinion or is\nit shaped by the media\nsocial and TV media have a powerful\nimpact on our perception of beauty often\nwith unrealistic and harmful standards\ntoday we'll delve into the ways the\nmedia distorts our perception of\nattractiveness and gives some practical\nadvice on how to fight back\nthe filtered reality\nwe all want to look our best but with\nthe rise of beauty filters on social\nmedia it's becoming harder and harder to\nseparate reality from fantasy these\nfilters promise to give us Perfect Skin\nsymmetrical features and a Flawless\ncomplexion but while it may seem\nharmless they're creating a new Beauty\nNorm that can make everything that's\ndifferent seem unattractive recently\nthis problem is being recognized as a\nnew phenomenon called Snapchat\ndysmorphia in fact researchers from\nBoston University School of Medicine\nbelieve that it's linked to body\ndysmorphic disorder a condition where\nindividuals obsess over perceived flaws\nin their appearance and at the same time\nit's pulling us further away from seeing\nthe natural beauty both in ourselves and\nothers\nabsurd standards remember that Old Spice\ncommercial with the super fit ripped guy\nriding a horse on the beach\nwell that's just one example of how ads\nand commercials sell us on not just\nproducts but also beauty standards they\nshow us these toned muscular bodies as\nthe perfect ideal but let's be real most\nof us probably have a bit of a belly or\nlove handles and even if you exercise\nand have a healthy lifestyle it doesn't\nmean you'll end up with a six pack but\nby being bombarded with such bodies it's\neasy to feel guilty if you skip that day\nin the gym this was shown in a 2009\nstudy published in the journal\npsychology of men and masculinity\ncommercials like these made the guys who\nsaw them self-conscious about their\nmuscles and overall physical appearance\nthe weight of expectations\nand while some people are told to be\nmuscular in order to be considered\nattractive others are ruthlessly shamed\nfor their weight\ncelebrities are especially susceptible\nto this type of scrutiny with countless\nexamples of tabloids shaming them for\ntheir bodies from Christina Aguilera\nbeing criticized for her pregnancy\nweight to Adele being ridiculed for her\nfeminine curves and even to Demi Lovato\nbeing shamed for gaining weight after\nrecovering from an eating disorder these\nexamples show the damaging effects of\nfat shaming in the media in fact a 2019\nstudy found that fat shaming can impact\nsociety's subconscious thoughts and lead\nto anti-overweight Attitudes this sends\nan unhealthy message that thinness is\nwhat's attractive but here's the truth\nbody type is just that a body type it\ndoesn't Define your beauty or worth\nshades of beautiful\nTV shows have a big impact on what\npeople think is pretty even when it\ncomes to race\nback in 1982 writer Alice Walker came up\nwith the word colorism to describe the\nway that darker-skinned black people can\nbe judged more harshly than those with\nlighter skin nowadays Hollywood is\nguilty of promoting colorism by mostly\npicking lighter-skinned black actors and\nactresses to play the main roles in\ntheir shows while darker skinned actors\noften get stuck playing Sidekicks or\ndon't get cast at all this is a serious\nissue because it distorts people's\nperception of Black Beauty but as\nlicensed psychologist Josephine almonds\nare said for WebMD one of the biggest\npsychological impacts of colorism is the\ndamage to one's core belief making some\nwith darker skin believe they're\nunworthy and causing emotional distress\ndepression and hopelessness\nrewiring for beauty\nhow can the media have such influence on\nwhat you perceive as attractive to\nanswer this we can take a look at the\npsychological concepts of familiarity\nand mere exposure effect first examined\nby social psychologist Robert zajonk in\nthe 1960s basically when we're exposes\nsomething repeatedly it becomes more\nfamiliar and we start to like it more\nso when you see retouched images and\nso-called Beauty ideals over and over\nand over again in the media it starts to\nshape your idea of what's attractive\nbut here's the good news you can take\ncontrol of your own perception of beauty\nstart by unfollowing people who promote\nthose unrealistic standards and follow\nthose who celebrate authenticity by\nseeing more realistic and diverse\nrepresentations of beauty your brain\nwill start to recognize and appreciate\nthose qualities as attractive that way\nhopefully you'll see that natural beauty\nin yourself and others are there some\nother ways the media twists our\nperception of attractiveness\nhow do you think we can challenge those\nNorms let us know in the comments we\nhope you don't let the media's distorted\nview of Attraction dictate your\nself-worth but instead embrace your\nunique features and celebrate your own\nBeauty\nand remember you matter we're releasing\nour first book filled with fun\npsychology
