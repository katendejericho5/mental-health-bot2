    "transcript": "according to marriage and family\ntherapist Dr Darlene Lancer most\nemotional abuse goes unnoticed and\nunreported and although it is an often\noverlooked form of abuse that doesn't\nmake it any less harmful or serious than\nphysical abuse Dr Lancer defines\nemotional abuse as behavior that is\npurposefully derogatory controlling\npunishing or manipulative towards\nanother person both men and women can be\nvictims of emotional abuse explains Dr\nLancer but unfortunately many don't even\nrealize when it's happening to them one\nof the reasons why emotional abuse is so\nhard to recognize is because abusers\nwill often blame their victims to\ndeflect their wrongdoings a common\ngaslighting and manipulation tactic\ncalled darvo that you should be

for\ninstitutional courage she defines darvo\nas a psychological manipulation tactic\nthat generates self-doubt and mistrust\nand exploits lack of awareness in\nvictims and those around them it stands\nfor D deny responsibility\na attack R rolls become reversed between\nthe V true victim and the O offender\nafraid first witnessed darvo in\ninstances of sexual assault or in those\naccused would often attack the victim's\ncredibility an outright denied the\nallegations against them making the\npublic distrust the victims in her 2017\nstudy together with fellow psychology\nProfessor Eileen zubrigan braid found\nthat victims of darvo often end up\nblaming themselves and self-silencing\nbut darvo can happen in friendships\nfamily relationships and even\ninstitutional Dynamics for

emotional\nabuse darvo in action Amanda kippert\neditor-in-chief of domestic shelters.org\ndescribes the three-step method of darvo\nmanipulation as follows deny abusers\nwill vehemently deny what they did and\nGaslight their victims into thinking\nthat they're just making a big deal out\nof nothing attack abusers will then\nattack the victim's credibility by\nbringing up anything in the past that\nthey can use against them this is so\nlike you remember when or questioning\ntheir victims mental stability values\nand motives are you in your right state\nof mind I can't believe the things\nyou're saying why are you doing this to\nme reverse victim and Defender at this\npoint most victims will often become\nstunned into silence and confusion they\nmay even begin to believe what the\nabuser is telling them which the abuser\nwill likely take as an opportunity to\nmanipulate the narrative further they'll\nmake themselves out to be the victim I'm\nso hurt and betrayed that you could even\nthink that about me what kind of person\naccused as a loved one of that and guilt\nthe true victim for even speaking up\nabout it in the first place and in doing\nso so they overshadow what the victim\nwas even trying to open up about and\nforce the true victim to defend\nthemselves from the abuser and others\ninstead of getting the help and support\nthey need tips for coping with darvo\npsychotherapist and Trauma recovery\nspecialist Dr Heather Kent says that\nemotional abuse such as darvo\nmanipulation can be very difficult to\nrecognize when you're on the receiving\nend of it and often it takes someone\nfrom the outside to help you realize\nwhat's actually happening and how it's\nnot okay the solution Dr Kent says is to\ngain more awareness and get out of that\nsituation as soon as possible\nprofessional counselor and\ntrauma-focused CBT therapist Eric\nPatterson also encourages and empowers\nvictims to resist darvo by recording the\nstory to reaffirm their perspectives\nfinding a safe space to heal from\nemotional distress and seeking support\nfrom loved ones recognizing and\ncountering their attacks and role\nreversal education Patterson says is
