    "transcript": "- They're egocentric, they're demanding,\nand it's always about them.\nNo, we're not talking about Andrew Tate.\nWe're talking about narcissists,\nbut even worse, a sexual narcissist.\nSexual narcissism is defined\nas a self-centered pattern\nof sexual behavior.\nFrom manipulation to shaming.\nThis type of narcissism is toxic\nand dangerous for anyone\nwho encounters it.\nThe purpose of this information\nis to identify the harmful\nand toxic behaviors of a sexual narcissist\nand to recognize if you might\nbe a victim of their abuse.\nNow, let's begin.\nNumber one, what about my feelings?\nIf your sex life was a movie,\nthen the sexual narcissist believes\nthat they're the main character\nwith the sexual narcissist.\nYour feelings, thoughts,\nand opinions about sex\ndon't really matter.\nIt's only ever about what they want.\nSince they view you as\nmerely an empty vessel\nfor their sexual desires and\nfantasies, for example, before\nor even during sex, you\nmay try to take the lead\nand disclose to your sexual partner some\nof the things you'd like to try.\nA sexual narcissist will not\nonly disregard your request,\nbut they'll belittle\nyou for even attempting\nto voice your opinions or desires\nfor the sexual narcissist.\nSex is not a shared experience\nof two bodies and minds.\nIt's an opportunity for\nthem to elevate their ego\nand exercise superiority.\nNot only that, they may\neven use humiliation\nas an abusive tactic to attempt\nto lower your self-esteem\nbecause the more vulnerable you are,\nthe more they can prey\non your insecurities.\nNumber two, manipulation.\nThis sign is one of the most harmful\nand toxic behaviors to look out for.\nSexual narcissists often\nemploy tactics of manipulation\nto get their needs met in the bedroom.\nThis includes violating boundaries, guilt,\ntripping, and lying.\nIf you don't agree to\nsatisfy their every whim,\nthey can even resort\nto disregarding consent\nand can use persuasive\ntactics to weigh you down\nuntil you say yes to having sex with them.\nFor example, if you are\nnot in the mood one day\nand you decline the narcissist\nrequest to have sex,\nthey may try to convince\nyou by using guilt.\nWell, if you really care about\nor love me, you'd want\nto have sex with me.\nOr even worse, they may\nprey upon your emotions\nand feelings for them by\nthreatening to break up\nwith you or stop seeing you.\nIf you don't engage in sexual activity,\nnever allow another person\nto coerce you into sex.\nIf you don't feel comfortable\nand they still insist on having\nsex, it's better to cut ties\nwith them altogether.\nNumber three, aggression.\nStanding up to a sexual\nnarcissist can trigger them\nto rage at you and it can get dangerous\nand violent real quick if you're\nnot careful. This behavior\n- Is in entitlement\nbecause the sexual narcissist\nbelieves they deserve\nto get their every desire fulfilled\nand that you have to follow\nsuit without question.\nAnd yes, this includes having sex too.\nWhen you don't do exactly\nas they say in the bedroom,\nthey might start to\ncriticize or devalue you.\nThey may start to pick apart your physical\nappearance and even mock you.\nWhen you try to draw healthy boundaries,\nwhich can be traumatizing\nand triggering the sexual narcissist,\naudacity is usually very brazen.\nThey'll act like you owe them something,\nespecially if they've\ntaken you out for dinner\nor just bought you lavish gifts.\nDoes this sound familiar?\nNumber four, craving validation.\nHumility is clearly not\nthe sexual narcissist\ngreatest strength.\nYou'll notice that being with\nthem is emotionally draining\nbecause you have to\nconstantly reassure them\nand boost their ego so\nthat they can keep their delusional sense\nof self-importance intact.\nThis also translates to the bedroom.\nEven when the sexual narcissist is trying\nto please you at first,\nthey're only doing it so\nthat you let your guard\ndown and trust them.\nThey do this so that\nyou view them favorably\nbecause despite their best\nefforts to hide insecurities,\nthey care deeply about\nhow others perceive them,\nwhich includes their performance in bed.\nIf you don't shower them with praise\nand adoration, you may see\na very ugly side of them\nand they may even rage against you.\nNumber five, infidelity.\nThe sexual narcissist\nusually resorts to infidelity\nbecause they're craving more\nattention and validation,\nand one sexual partner isn't enough.\nThis also comes right\nbefore they plan on discarding you,\nwhich is something narcissists tend to do\nto others in general,\nbut it's also common for them\nto discard their sexual\npartners when they feel they've\nserved their purpose\nand no longer view them\nas useful or valuable.\nIt's cruel and inconsiderate,\nbut this is why narcissists\nare known for lacking empathy\nand sexual narcissists are no exception.\nYou won't be the first and\ncertainly not the last.\nIt's better to realize as soon as possible\nthat the sexual narcissist is preoccupied\nwith their own needs\nand desires, so discarding\nyou comes easy for them.\nRemember, someone does\nnot need to be diagnosed\nwith narcissistic\npersonality disorder in PD\nto be a sexual narcissist, and\nalthough both possess similar\ntraits, they're not the same\nand one requires a diagnosis.\nHave you ever dealt with\na sexual narcissist?\nWhat was your experience?\nLet us know in the comments.\nIf you like this video,\nbe sure to check out\nwhat is sexual narcissism\nlinked in the description.\nAs always, have an amazing day."
