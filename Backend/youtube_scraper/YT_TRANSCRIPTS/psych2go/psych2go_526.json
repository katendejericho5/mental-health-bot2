suffered from a rocky\nrelationship with her father which\ncaused bouts of depression and\nself-hatred starting from her teen years\nher success at such a young age caused\nher to feel guilt and she felt like she\nshouldn't feel such an emptiness when\nshe had everything\nin truth depression has no bounds as to\nwho it can affect young old Rich poor it\ncan Target anyone\nunfortunately many teens have been\nisolated in their homes with their\nparents due to the nature of the past\ntwo years and for many it has only\nworked to fuel their depression and make\nthem more susceptible to it many parents\nhave trouble understanding the overall\nconcept of depression so when they're\ndirectly confronted with it they might\nonly make it worse so with that said\nhere are some things that parents do\nthat fuel teenage depression\nnumber one they're constantly comparing\nyou\ndo you feel like you can never do\nanything right they might always find\nsome fault in what you do and compare\nyou to a friend or a family member\nasking you why you can't be more like\nthem\nit seems like everything you do is\ncompared to another like nothing is\nentirely your own this can leave you\nwith a feeling of failure and confusion\nas to why you aren't good enough you\nalso might personally start to compare\nyourself while every teen at some point\nCompares themselves to their peers it's\nreally damaging when it's Amplified by\nyour parents as a teenager in these\nyears of critical growth and change it's\nimportant that you stay true to yourself\nand that you are your own person\nwhen those you trust the most begin to\ncompare you the lines can easily become\nblurred and you can lose sight of Who\nYou Are\nyou start questioning your overall\npersonality and worth which can cause\nunhappiness and low self-esteem\npotentially spiraling into depression\nnumber two they shut down moments of\nvulnerability\nbeing truthful and emotional with your\nparents can be scary and it takes a lot\nof courage to do do you find that when\nyou do finally open up to your parents\nthey find ways to completely dismiss the\nfact that you're struggling that they\nthink your depression is just some\npassing phase in your teenage years so\nthey don't take it seriously they might\nsay things like why are you so sad\nyou've got a good life\nor maybe if you weren't on your phone so\nmuch you wouldn't be so depressed they\nfind excuses and tiptoe around the issue\nat hand and just don't understand how\nyou are actually feeling they have\ntrouble coming to terms with your\nsituation and therefore deny it and find\nother reasons as to why you might be\nfeeling in a certain way this may leave\nyou feeling unheard and unsupported\nbecause really all you're seeking is\nthat parental love and understanding\nthat every child should have especially\nin the unpredictable years of being a\nteam\nthe lack of the support might succeed in\nmaking you feel even more Hollow and\nlonely number three they guilt trip you\nyour parents might do certain things to\ninduce a reaction out of you\nspecifically feelings of guilt or shame\nfor instance they might make passive\naggressive comments about your state\nparents often do this to make you feel\nguilty enough to dismiss your issues\ninstead of dealing with them\nthey may say your depression is\nburdening the whole family which makes\nyou feel remorseful for even feeling\nwhat you're feeling in the first place\nurging you to ignore your depression so\nthat you're not such a burden they might\nalso ignore any attempts to talk about\nyour situation leaving you feeling like\nit isn't important and not a real\nproblem their guilt tripping only\nrepresses your emotions keeping them\nbottled up and with this there's a risk\nthat eventually your emotions will\ndangerously hit you all at once\nnumber four they're overly strict\ndo you feel like you can't do anything\nwhen you ask to do something like spend\ntime with your friends or something even\nremotely fun they deny it and tell you\nto do something more productive like\nschoolwork\nthey don't let you explore the joys that\ncome with the youthfulness of your teen\nyears and instead restrict you and\nsuffocate you this may lead you to feel\nisolated and cause anxiety when you\nactually do go into social situations\nthe lack of exposure to the real world\ncan affect your socializing skills in\nthe future which can in turn disturb\nyour career and personal relationships\nand all of these things can fuel\ndepression\nnumber five they blame you for\neverything\ndo you ever feel like you're the\nscapegoat for every argument your\nparents might pull you into a situation\nthat doesn't involve you and put you in\nthe middle you become the target of\ntheir anger and Scorn for instance you\nmight find yourself taking the blame for\nsomething a sibling or maybe even one of\nyour parents did\nit's exhausting and it causes you to\nlive on edge waiting for the next fight\nyou'll find that you feel isolated and\ndifferent from those who are supposed to\naccept and nurture you\nyou might also start to think that\nyou're actually doing something wrong to\ncause such a reaction from your parents\nthis specific kind of isolation one that\nmakes you feel out of place in your own\nhome can be extremely detrimental to\nyour mental health they're constant\nberating only puts you at risk of\nfalling into or fueling your depression\ndo you struggle with depression are your\nparents showing these signs if so try\nreaching out to a trusted friend teacher\nschool counselor or any other adult that\nyou trust to help you get some real\nconstructive care\nalthough you might not have the support\nof your parents you can ask for\nassistance from other trusted adults\naround you to ease the weight off your\nshoulders\n[Music]"
