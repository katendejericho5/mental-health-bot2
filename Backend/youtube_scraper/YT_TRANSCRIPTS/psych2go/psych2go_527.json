purposefully\ndelivered to shatter your sense of\nself-worth however there is something\namiss when you are extremely sensitive\nto criticism according to psychiatrist\nGlenn gabard in comparison with their\ngrandiose counterparts covert\nnarcissists tend to possess the thinnest\nskin and are super sensitive they are\neasily triggered and feel offended\nwhenever they receive real or

sigh I look old but in reality they\nwant others to come to their rescue and\nshower them with statements to negate\ntheir self-deprecation by downplaying\ntheir strength the covert narcissist has\nfound a sneaky way to make others\ncomplement them so that they feel good\nabout themselves they are most likely\nunaware that the underlying reason\nthey're behaving like this is because

people\nare feeling and thinking but they're\nunable to develop emotional empathy on\nthe surface people with covert\nnarcissism may seem to be compassionate\nand generous but on a deeper level their\nkind behavior is self-serving as they do\nit to be seen as the good guy and\npraised by the people around them if\nthese behaviors are not admired the\ncovert narcissists will be resentful\nno
