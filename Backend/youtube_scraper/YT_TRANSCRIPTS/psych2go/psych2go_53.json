    "transcript": "- Have you experienced trauma\nor neglect in your childhood?\nIt may seem like a part\nof you will always carry\nthat darkness within you,\nbut recovery is 100% possible to achieve.\nIt's a long journey that\nwill have its ups and downs,\nbut as long as you stay hopeful\nand motivated, you can find\nyour way towards healing.\nThis video will cover some\nof the steps you can take\nto get closer to your goal of healing.\nThe information in this video\nis based on a book called\nRunning On Empty, overcome Your\nChildhood Emotional Neglect.\nIt was written by Dr.\nJohnny Sw, who specializes in\nchildhood trauma and neglect.\nLet's see what advice\nshe has for you in store.\nNumber one, realize it's not your fault\nbefore you start your recovery journey.\nAs Dr. Webb explains, you need to come\nto an important realization.\nLet's try an exercise together.\nSay these words out loud.\nIt's not my fault. Really say it out loud.\nChildhood trauma and neglect\ncan often make children develop\nfeelings of guilt, blame and shame.\nYou might feel that somehow\nyou deserved to be treated\nthat way, but that's not the case at all.\nThere is nothing you could\nhave done to deserve it.\nYou were an innocent child\nwho wanted to be loved,\nand you should have gotten that love.\nSo if your memories sometimes\ntake you to those bad places,\nremember to say it out loud.\nIt's not my fault.\nNumber two, welcome your emotions.\nAn emotionally neglecting household is an\nemotion free household.\nIn a way you are trained to ignore\nand diminish your\nemotions for that reason.\nGetting back in touch with\nwhat you feel is an important part\nof overcoming your trauma.\nThe first step is to understand\nthat even if the child in\nyou blocked your emotions\nto protect itself, that\ndoesn't mean they aren't there.\nMaybe you can't describe them yet,\nbut you're experiencing a\nrange of emotions every day.\nEven Carl Rogers, a notable\nAmerican psychologist,\ntalked about acceptance.\nThe curious paradox, it is\nwhen I accept myself just\nas I am, then I can change.\nSo try to accept your emotions\nand welcome them as a\nvaluable part of your being\nas you begin healing.\nNumber three, recognize\nand identify your emotions.\nThe next step is learning how to recognize\nand identify those emotions.\nSometimes you'll find it hard\nto identify the feelings you're\nexperiencing when that happens.\nPay attention to your body.\nFor example, are your muscles tense?\nAre you mindlessly fidgeting?\nThis could mean that you're anxious\nor nervous about something.\nAnother thing you could\ndo when you're not sure\nhow you're feeling is to take\na look at an emotion chart.\nDr. Webb provides great tools\nin her book, a detailed list\nof emotions as well as an\nemotion chart, so feel free\nto check them out if you need help\nwith learning about what you feel.\nNumber four, keep track of how you feel.\nOnce you learn how to recognize\nand identify your emotions,\ntry keeping track of them.\nYou could use a journal\nor download an emotion\ntracking app on your phone.\nThe effectiveness of this\ntechnique was shown in a few\ntrauma survivors in a 2002\n- Study authors of said Study.\nBelieve that journaling about\nyour feelings could help you\nprocess repetitive intrusive thoughts.\nSo every few hours,\nwrite down where you are,\nwhat you're doing, and how\nyou're feeling at that moment.\nWriting it down could help\nyou build a habit of tuning in\nwith your emotions so\nthat one day you can do it\neffortlessly and automatically.\nAlso, you'd be able to go back\nand take a look at your\nentries, which would allow you\nto see a possible trend.\nMaybe you find out that certain people\nor situations consistently\nmake you feel down.\nIs there something you can do\nto make those instances more bearable?\nOr you may notice\nthat you've been exceptionally\ncheerful during the last week.\nWhat is it that made you so happy\nand how can you get more of it?\nNumber five, find ways to self-soothe.\nAs a neglected child,\nthere's a chance your\nparents didn't give you\nmuch needed comfort.\nWhen you were upset, they\nprobably weren't there\nto wipe your tears or rock you to sleep.\nAs a result, today, you\nmight have trouble dealing\nwith stress, anger, or any\noverwhelming situation.\nYou might still seek\nsomeone to comfort you,\nbut recovery actually means finding\nthat comfort within yourself.\nYou can achieve that by\nlearning to self soothe.\nAs the name suggests, it's a skill\nand enables you to calm\nyourself when you need it\nand find some peace when things get rough.\nA 2017 research article shows\nthat this technique can\nreally be beneficial even\nfor those suffering from PTSD.\nYou can try out three simple steps\nto learn how to self-soothe.\nStep one, make a list\nof possible strategies\nthat you could use to calm yourself down.\nDo you like a cup of hot\nchocolate on bad days?\nCurling up in a fluffy\nblanket, cuddling your pet.\nYou can put as many things\nas you like on that list.\nMake sure to include some things\nthat are easily accessible\nwherever you are, such\nas taking three deep breaths.\nFor example. Step two.\nThis is where emotions charts\nand identifying your\nemotions come in handy.\nWhen you notice a strong negative feeling,\nit's time to check out your list.\nAnd step three, try out\ndifferent strategies\nand pay attention to what\nworks and what doesn't work.\nMaybe petting your dog\nworks when you're sad,\nbut not when you're angry.\nFeel free to modify your list.\nCrossing out strategies\nand adding new ones.\nYou may find it hard at first\nto come to terms with yourself\nand your emotions.\nIt'll probably seem scary,\ndifficult, and unachievable,\nbut please don't lose hope.\nStart with small baby steps\nand work your way up when it gets hard.\nRemember the child you once were,\nand remember, you're doing this for them.\nGive them all the love you didn't receive.\nIf you'd like to read the whole book\nto gain even more insight into\ntherapeutic strategies you\ncan take, visit the\nlink in the description.\nWe got your back.
