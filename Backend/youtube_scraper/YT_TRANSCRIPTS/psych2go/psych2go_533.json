a lot of\nmisconceptions about introvert simply\nnot liking other people or introverts\nbeing around others can be draining and\nthere could be a biological reason for\nit\nstudy in the Journal of cognitive\nNeuroscience found that introverts\nprocess social stimuli in the brain\ndifferently from extroverts when exposed\nto images of human faces extroverted\npeople were associated with having 300\nbrain waves with higher amplitudes study\nalso found that extroverts were more\nsensitive or attentive to and found\ngreater motivational value in Social\nstimulus introverts introverts tend to\nkeep to themselves a lot more often than\ntheir extroverted counterparts after a\ncertain time their social battery runs\nout which is when being around others\ncan be tiresome the study might explain\nwhy for introverts being around other\npeople might not provide as much value\nas for extrovert making them prefer\nbeing alone more to other people\nyou're a highly sensitive person\naccording to psychology today a highly\nsensitive person HSP is someone\nsensitive to sensory processing\nprocessing and increased emotional\nsensitivity or reactivity to external\nand internal stimuli it's estimated that\n15 to 20 percent of the population are\nhsps\nyou're in HSP you might find it\ndifficult to be around others because\nthere's so much information to process\nthe conversations actions or even\nemotions of other be overwhelming issues\nwith processing might even make you\nupset in social situations for instance\nbeing around too many people can lead\nyou to feel over stimulated or\noverwhelmed even irritable or anxious\nsensory processing sensitivity is not\nsomething that can simply be switched\noff which is why hsps might avoid overly\nsocial settings\neye intelligence research suggests that\nhighly intelligent people actually\nprefer to be alone instead of around\nothers in a paper published in the\nBritish Journal of Psychology by Lee and\nkanazawa it was discovered that highly\nintelligent people experience lower life\nsatisfaction when they socialize more\noften with friends these findings were\nbased in evolutionary psychology in\ngroups the more intelligent members were\nable to solve problems without needing\nhelp from their friends and are happier\nbeing alone to solve challenges on their\nown Solitude is a way for highly\nintelligent people to reset themselves\nafter being in highly stressful Urban\nenvironments still even though highly\nintelligent people might feel like they\ndon't benefit as much from friendships\nhe still might socialize just as much or\neven more often than last intelligent\npeople this isn't to say that highly\nintelligent people don't socialize but\nif you find yourself able to thrive and\nsolve problems better on your own it\nmight be one of the reasons why you\ndon't like being around others final\nthoughts it's important to understand\nwhy some people may not enjoy
