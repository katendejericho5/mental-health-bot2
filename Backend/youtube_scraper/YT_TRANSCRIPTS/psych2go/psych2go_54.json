    "transcript": "- Let's be so real right now.\nIf you're not already\nin a happy relationship,\nchances are you're looking\nfor the one, your soulmate,\nyour peanut butter to your jelly.\nDepending on how you were raised,\nyou may have developed a\nparticular attachment style,\nwhich we unfortunately bring\nwith us into the dating search.\nWe've talked about them\nbefore on this channel,\nbut let's recap the four\nmain attachment styles.\nSecure a long and healthy relationship.\nThis is the one we all strive for.\nAvoidant can't build long-term\nrelationships avoids any type\nof intimacy, anxious, codependent,\nand scared of rejection\nor abandonment, disorganized\ntrouble, trusting others,\nand changing behaviors.\nWe're going to focus on avoidant\nand anxious attachments,\nand we'll see what happens when\nthese two attachment styles\nend up in a relationship.\nYou want to hug? Ew.\nAvoidant attachment is\narguably the most difficult\nattachment style to have\na relationship with.\nLike the other attachment styles.\nIt's developed due to the way\ntheir caregivers raised them.\nThis doesn't mean their caregivers ignored\nor avoided their child.\nThe caregivers avoided\nany display of emotion\nor intimacy with a child.\nThink of a child falling down,\nscraping their knee and crying.\nSometimes children cry out of fear\nor shock, not necessarily due to pain.\nAdults know this instead\nof comforting the child\nand helping them realize\nthat they're all right.\nThe caregivers may see something like,\nyou'd better stop crying\nor I'll give you something to cry about.\nThis lets the child know that\nwhat just happened isn't\na valid reason for tears\nand crying should be\nreprimanded in the future.\nThe child may not want to show sadness\nor let people see them cry.\nThis is also the same for\nparents who may not give hugs\nor physical intimacy to their child.\nIn an adult relationship,\navoidant attachment can show up\nas a strong sense of\nindependence, avoiding emotional\nor physical intimacy,\nfeeling threatened by anyone\nwho attempts to be close\nand a belief that they don't need anyone.\nA read out of the Woods.\nTaylor Swift's song Out\nof the Woods was a bit of a\ncontroversial one when it came\nout for such a talented lyricist.\nA lot of people were\ndisappointed with the chorus.\nIf you haven't heard\nit, the song's Chorus is\njust Taylor repeating.\nAre we out of the woods\nand are we in the clear?\nAt first glance, it seems a little easy,\nbut once I found out\nthe reason I was gagged,\nthat depicted level of anxiety\nand codependency in a toxic relationship,\nthe lines were repeated over\nand over to mimic the cyclical feeling\nof the relationship's, ups and downs.\nThis is a great way to\ndescribe anxious attachment.\nThose with anxious attachment\nmay have had caregivers\nthat went from being attentive\nto indifferent to the child.\nThese caregivers may have\nalso gone overwhelmed easily\nor possibly blame the child\nfor being the reason\nwhy they're overwhelmed\nor upset in a relationship.\nAn anxious attachment can\nmanifest as being clingy\nto their partner, needing\napproval from their partner,\nbeing scared of actual or\nperceived criticism and judgment,\nand having feelings of\nunworthiness put 'em\ntogether and what do we have?\nThe dating world is crazy\nand beautiful all at once.\nOne of the beautiful things is that we get\nto meet people from all\nwalks of life. The crazy\n- Thing that we have to find\nways to work together to create\nthat healthy relationship.\nWhat if an anxious attachment,\nlet's name her Amy,\nand an avoidant attachment.\nLet's name him. Mark got together.\nWhat would happen as an avoidant?\nMark never received any signs of physical\nor emotional intimacy from his caregivers.\nWhenever Amy goes to give\nhim a hug or a kiss just\nbecause he moves out of the way or cringes\n'cause Amy is incredibly\nsensitive to rejection,\nshe now believes that\nMark is upset with her\nor possibly doesn't love her anymore\nas an anxious attachment\nwith codependent tendencies,\nAmy wants Mark to come with\nher to the grocery store.\nShe figures they can make a day out of it.\nMark immediately declines\nbecause he can do his errands on his own.\nSo should Amy. These two\nconsistently trigger past wounds\nfrom each other's childhood,\nbut they don't realize it.\nThey're also not communicating these\npain points with each other.\nUnfortunately, if they don't communicate,\nthey will continue unknowingly hurting\nand invalidating each\nother and the relationship.\nIt will quickly spiral into\nan unhealthy toxic one.\nI don't know about you, but Amy\nand Mark's relationship seemed miserable.\nNow, let's clarify that any\nkind of individual with any kind\nof attachment style can be in\na relationship with anyone.\nHowever, the trick is to\ncommunicate with your partner\nand even a mental health\nprofessional to see\nhow you can work through\nyour attachment style\nand how to make it work with your partner.\nHave you ever been in\nthis relationship dynamic?\nShould we do another video like this\nwith another combo of attachment styles?\nLet us know in the comments\nand don't forget to like,\nsubscribe and share with a friend.\nSee you next time."
