    "transcript": "Hello site to go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Emma McAdam you\nmay know her from the YouTube channel\ntherapy in a nutshell where she creates\ncontent centered on psychology and\nmental health she's also a licensed\nmarriage and family therapist Emma's\nbeen a guest on psych2go before and\nwe're so excited to have her here again\nto discuss the topic of derealization\nand depersonalization welcome Emma thank\nyou so much for joining us today hey\nthank you so much for having me I'm\nexcited to be here\nwe are too we're so excited to have you\nhere so can you tell us a little bit\nabout yourself and your background sure\nyeah so I'm a licensed marriage and\nfamily therapist I've been working in\nthe treatment field since 2004 and I've\nI've worked in a bunch of settings like\njuvenile Corrections\num I worked in a Wilderness a couple of\nwilderness treatment programs a couple\nof Adventure treatment programs and\nresidential treatment and currently I do\nOutpatient Therapy in Utah\nand how long have you been on YouTube\nuh let's see I put my first YouTube\nvideo up about six years ago\nwow yeah that's amazing and I'm a big\nfan just on a personal level thank you\nthank you yeah I do I do love it so yeah\nawesome and just for starters so just to\nbegin on the topic how do you define\nderealization and depersonalization\ndisorder I know those two terms are used\ninterchangeably so if you wanted to like\nDefine both separately I just want to\nknow like why people use it\ninterchangeably as well be interesting\nyeah yeah so D realization is like where\nthe world feels unreal and\ndepersonalization is where you feel like\nnot a person or detached from your\npersonhood so if we break that down just\na little bit derealization often feels\nlike when someone's experiencing really\nhigh anxiety things might start to feel\nfuzzy or off things might um like sounds\nmight sound different or\num that time might feel really fast or\nreally slow or they might feel kind of\nBuzzy and fuzzy and so that's like the\nreal uh the realization is like things\njust don't feel the way they normally do\nthings don't feel real or deep\npersonalization is you don't feel\nconnected to yourself to your body to\nyour mind or your soul like you feel\nlike you're maybe floating above\nyourself sometimes or people I've had\none client who described this to me is\nlike I just don't feel like I'm a person\nI don't feel like I'm like I'm a real\nperson here like I'm looking at myself\nand being like what is that you know oh\nthat's interesting what are the main\nsymptoms to look out for in yourself or\nsomeone else\nso usually\num I and I do want to kind of make it a\ndistinguishing like to separate\ndiagnoses here so usually when we're\ntalking about derealization and\ndepersonalization we're talking about\num when your anxiety gets so high that\num your body kind of creates this\num or your brain and body kind of create\nwhat they call an airbag where it kind\nof numbs or deadens your Sensations or\nAlters your sensation so usually when\nwe're talking about dere personalization\nwe're talking about it in conjunction\nwith an anxiety disorder sometimes a\ndepressive disorder and frequently with\ntrauma so and Trauma you know\ncontributes to anxiety and depression so\nthe symptoms are with those you usually\nhave a lot of anxiety a lot of stress\nthings are building things are mounting\nor you're having a panic attack and when\nthey hit that like climax of like kind\nof the worst then your body creates this\nkind of like Goose like like you like in\nmovies where you see people kind of\nseparate out from themselves and things\nslow down\num sounds sounds different or um you\njust feel detached from a sense of\nreality from your Sensations thoughts or\nemotions or your Sensations just feel\nreally kind of weird\nand those differences are important\nright in like diagnosing mm-hmm\nthey are so when we do a differential\ndiagnosis um you know a lot of people\nwonder like does this mean I'm\nschizophrenic does this mean I'm like\nyou know having um a delusion here and\nit's it's important to note that it's\nnot like derealization depersonalization\nare connected with anxiety depression\nand Trauma and schizophrenia sometimes\nhas some similar symptoms but they're\nnot the same at all like that's a\ndifferent diagnosis and um comes with a\nlot of different symptoms so if you're\nexperiencing derealization\ndepersonalization it's it's not\nschizophrenic it's it's anxiety\ndepression or trauma usually okay that\nmakes sense because um I was gonna ask\nwhat does it have to do with childhood\ntrauma especially because I know that\nfor both disorders\num dissociation is a major symptom so\nyep yep so okay I like to think of this\nfrom a polyvagal theory approach so poly\nBagel is a body-based approach to\nunderstanding trauma and if we look at\nyour nervous system when you're um you\nknow just doing your thing your default\nsetting is this safety mode this um rest\nconnect did just feed and breed right\nthey say so you're relaxed you're able\nto enjoy connecting with people you are\ninterested in eating your nervous system\nis kind of calm and it heals and stuff\nand then when there's a threat you bump\nup into this nervous system arousal or\nnervous system activation where you do\nthe fight flight freeze response and if\nyou can fight off that threat you know\nyou often have this heightened kind of\nlike your your body goes into fight or\nflight mode most people know what that\nis but your your blood uh your your\nheart rate pumps uh your heart pumps\nfaster and your muscles get activated\nand all of that and then the next step\non this poly Vega ladder actually I'm\nkind of doing it up like upside down but\nyou have the safety mode you go into\nactivation mode and when something is\noverwhelming when the threat seems\nimpossible to overcome the third state\nof your nervous system is this shutdown\nresponse\nso the shutdown response and and the\nsometimes people refer to this as freeze\nbut there's a type of freeze where\nyou're like and you're really keyed up\nand you're like frozen but like really\nat like a high activation level and the\nshutdown response is like a flip gets a\nswitch gets flipped and you go down into\nthis\num very old nervous system reaction that\nprotects you from a danger that you\ncan't escape\nso I'm sorry if this is getting a little\ntoo technical here but this this\nshutdown response\num essentially numbs your feelings it\nhelps you dissociate from your feelings\nso let's imagine you're a little baby\nimpala and a cheetah is chewing on you\nlike the old you can't kick it away you\ncan't fight it off the only thing your\nbody can do is make you just shut down\ndetach not move maybe the cheetah will\nget bored and you won't be feeling it so\nmuch when it's happening and then you\njust jump up and run away like I've seen\nvideos of this where this has happened\nso the shutdown response protects you\nfrom Big overwhelming threats that you\ncan't escape so if we compare that to\nChildhood drama that's what your\nquestion was childhood trauma and I'm\nlike here let me teach you about the\nnervous system but thank you for that\nit's a childhood trauma\num if you think about being a little kid\nin a chronic trauma experience like\nwhere your family is abusive a cptsd\nexperience then there's frequently these\nexperiences you can't escape they're\nfrequently painful you're frequently\nscared or you're unable to connect with\nsomeone for safety so maybe people are\nyelling and you're all alone or maybe\nyou're in threats of physical or sexual\nviolence and you can't escape it your\nbody is gonna shift from feeling safe to\nfeeling activated and it's like well I\ncan't escape there's nothing I can do\nabout this let's dissociate to protect\nmy human that's what your brain will do\nit'll trigger that dissociation response\nas a protective mechanism and\num to protect you from those painful\nfeelings it can it can kind of like flip\na switch it's like okay let's make you\nnot feel real for a little while while\nthese bad things are happening and it's\na good protective mechanism in the short\nterm but if it's a habitual response\nthat becomes learned and you know how\nneural Pathways work the more you do\nsomething the more likely your brain\nwants to do something eventually that\ndefense mechanism becomes habitual and\nit's no longer helpful so now maybe as\nan adult you're in a work meeting and\nyou feel a little stressed out and then\nall of a sudden you like that switch\ngets right and you're no longer\nconnected to yourself and that can feel\nquite scary too\nyeah and as a result when you dissociate\ncould you become emotionally numb is\nthat what it is as well like an a\nnumbness especially over time yeah\nnumbness is a really big part of it yep\nso um as you'd associate yeah emotional\nnumbing is a big part of it emotional\nblunting or feeling separated from your\nemotions or shut down\nand you mentioned in one of your videos\non depersonalization that dissociating\noccasionally doesn't necessarily mean\nthat you have the disorder so how can\nsomeone tell the difference that's a\nthat's a good question I think in\ngeneral\num and we could pull up the DSM we could\npull up with the the diagnostic manual\nsays but in general with these disorders\nwhen they're persistent when they happen\nfrequently when they're unwanted and\nwhen they interfere with your ability to\nfunction in your life so they're\ninterfering with your ability to connect\nin your relationships or to do your job\nor to just feel okay in your life that\nthat usually indicates that it's time to\nget some help\nyeah and so the feeling of being outside\nyour body I mean is that common for\neveryone to experience or is that just\nsomething that you know happens to some\npeople can everyone like kind of relate\nto that\nyou know I think\num I I don't have the numbers on that I\ndon't know but depersonalization where\nyou feel separate from your from from\nyourself is is kind of a unique\nsituation and I was looking at some\nnumbers and and it said you know up to\n50 of people with depression have\nexperienced some form of derealization\nor depersonalization so it's more coming\nthan we think yeah more common than we\nthink that they maybe would experience\nthis and then again I think I read\nsomewhere people with panic attacks\nmaybe 17 to 30 percent of the time\nexperience this feeling\nand then how can someone be diagnosed\nwith derealization or depersonalization\nlike if they were wondering if they have\nit and they want to find out yeah yeah\nyou would definitely want to work with a\nlicensed mental health professional so\nsometimes doctors would diagnose this\nbut in general you'd go to a therapist\nor counselor with a degree and they\nwould um they would go through the\nchecklist with you and and um\ndecide if that diagnosis fits your\nsituation best\nand I was going to ask um like how is\nsomeone diagnosed maybe like if they\ndon't know that they're going through it\nbecause a lot of people I like when I\nwas reading about it I was shocked I was\nlike oh this is something I think I\nmight have experienced and I didn't even\nknow this was an actual disorder So like\num have you ever like diagnosed someone\num and then we maybe they didn't realize\nthey had it you know not secretion so\nthis is interesting because I really I\nthink of this as\nis a good question I've never personally\ndiagnosed someone with this diagnosis\nfor two reasons one is because it in my\nmind it often just falls under the\ncategory of trauma so when I'm working\nwith someone with trauma I think of this\nin the whole context of a nervous system\napproach I think of this in the whole\ncontext of a trauma-informed care and\nfor me like the thought of dissociation\ndepersonalization derealization is a\nsymptom of PTSD and we're treating PTSD\nso usually the label that\num we go with if we want to get funding\nso I'm also kind of the second reason is\nI'm kind of like at arm's length with\ndiagnoses I have a love-hate\nrelationship with diagnosis diagnoses\nare absolutely helpful when we want to\ncommunicate with other people when we\nwant to get funding for our treatment\nwhen we want to do research diagnoses\nand labels are really helpful and when\npeople over identify with the diagnosis\nand they say well this is who I am this\nis how I am this is something permanent\nabout me then diagnoses can create a\nlittle bit of learned helplessness and a\nlittle a bit of cause a little bit of\nharm there so yeah that's one of the\nreasons why I don't I'm kind of arm's\nlength with diagnoses like these but\nunderstanding the symptoms and giving\nthe symptoms a name like oh this is a\ndissociative episode this is what\ndissociation or derealization is and\nthis is there's a name for it now\nsomeone can come to me and say well oh I\nhad a derealization episode or I'm\nexperiencing derealization is\num something that's really helpful for\npeople so going back to what you said\nyou know have I ever diagnosed someone\nwith this there's definitely been times\nwhere I'm working with someone with PTSD\nand I'm like and and they're having a\ndissociative episode where they're\nfeeling you know derealization or or\nsomething like that and I'm like hey\nthis is what you're experiencing did you\nnotice what led up to it let's talk\nabout the triggers let's talk about\nwhat's going on mentally for you or the\nstressors you were having that led to\nthings getting so overwhelming that your\nbody decided oh let's protect my person\nby triggering this response so\ndefinitely helpful to add that\nlanguaging I've never worked with\nsomeone who experienced these symptoms\nall by themselves themselves and I know\nthere are people like that I saw a video\num\nI think it was on the BBC there was a\nYoutube video um from the BBC about\nsomeone in England who they just have\nfelt like depersonalization for years\nyears and years and that's kind of their\nonly diagnosis that they mentioned\num but for me I usually kind of put it\nas a sub diagnosis under under\ndepression anxiety or um PTSD it's\nperfect that you touched on that because\nI was about to ask that what causes\num the realization and deep\npersonalization I know you said\nchildhood trauma is a big one so if you\ncould expand on that and also maybe some\nother possible\num causes for it yeah I mean I worked\nwith a client who had a bipolar disorder\nand when he was hypomanic straight\nbipolar 2 when he was hypomatic which is\na low Mania he just felt like highly\nenergized for like a week twice a year\nhe just felt like a lot of energy went\nout and bought some stuff and like was\nexcited and then for the other like six\nmonths of the year at a time six months\nand then a week and then six months in\nthe week he would just feel kind of like\nlow and down and dead and numb and that\nwould be like in that situation I do\nthink it was bipolar that was really\ndirectly contributing to those feelings\nof of derealization like he just felt\nkind of num num num and in that\nsituation bipolar is probably a better\ndiagnosis for him\num I think in general when we look at\nhow stress Works\num depression\nis usually preceded by high levels of\nstress and an anxiety disorder is\nessentially about stress and uh PTSD is\nabout chronic stress so or well cptsd\nlike when we talk about childhood trauma\nabuse and neglect\num PTSD by itself can be a short-term\nstress a very acute stress that then\nbecomes chronic by the way we look at it\nso what causes depersonalization and\nderealization my conceptualization of it\nis when your nervous system gets\noverwhelmed by stressors\num that you aren't resolving so you've\ngot these things coming up in your life\nmaybe with anxiety disorders it's like\nworry and you just worry and you worry\nand you worry this is the main stressor\nthat causes generalized anxiety disorder\nand you're constantly worrying and\nworrying and worrying then eventually\num\nthe long-term effects of that is that\nyour internal mental reserves and your\nphysical reserves get worn down and you\ndon't have the ability to kind of face\nthose worries anymore and your body's\nlike I'm overwhelmed\nlife is too overwhelming my human is too\noverwhelmed we've got to revert to this\nshutdown state to protect my human and\nso that kind of triggers that that\nderealization experience and and with\ndepression I think you know chronic\nstressors like well first off like\ninternal stressors like beating yourself\nup constantly telling yourself you're a\nbad person and that can also stem from\nhaving been told you're a bad person or\nbeing mistreated as a child right but\nlike just constantly feeling like\num everything's awful catastrophizing so\nthese cognitive distortions these are\nall essentially stressors they're\nthreats your body perceives them as\nthreats your brain perceives them as\nthreats and with depression I think\nmy favorite conceptualization of\ndepression is when you're when your\nsystem gets overwhelmed by adversity it\ngoes into again like a kind of a\nshutdown state so yeah I love that you\nbrought that because I think that you're\nthe first person on YouTube to actually\nlike really um\nsort of lump it in in a good way like\nlump it in with childhood trauma and\ncomplex PTSD like even in our own videos\nI've never\num seen the connection and now I see it\nlike the stress can make someone\ndissociate and I can see how it would\ncause that and um I was going to ask um\nso when it comes to disassociation what\nare the in from what you've seen what\nare the emotional and physical\nmanifestations of that mm-hmm\nwell dissociation is interesting because\nit's like leading up to dissociation or\ndepersonalization derealization leading\nup to it the emotions are often big\nintense loud emotions like fear\num stress\nShame Shame is a big one\num\ndiscouragement and so or or as\nespecially anxiety agitation and fear\nright the the aspects of fear so as\npeople lead up to dissociation there's\ngenerally this like building and\nbuilding and building and building and\nwhen people don't have the resources but\nthey don't have the support network or\nthey don't have the skills to take those\nemotions one at a time and process\nthrough them and work through them and\nresolve them so let's say you're like\nyour little kid and your parents are\nfighting and screaming and it's scary\nall the time in your house and they\ndon't let you talk to anyone or you\ndon't know you don't have words for it\nright those emotions get bottled up and\nthey just build they just build and and\nthen and we're super resilient like\nhumans are super resilient we all have\nan inherent ability to resolve emotions\nto resolve stress but the problem is\nwhen it happens too fast for us to\nmanage we get overwhelmed or when it\nhappens for too long we have like\nreserves and we have reserves and we're\nresilient and we keep trying and then at\nsome point our body's like okay\nthat's enough like I'm not going to be\ndealing with this anymore we got to\nprotect your brain's like I'm gonna\nprotect my Human by just like detaching\nand it's not like people do it on\npurpose it's not like people do it\nintentionally it's just something that\nhappens and so a lot of times people can\nfeel kind of out of control about it\nlike this is something that happens to\nme really messes me up\num oh one of the other features that I\nforgot to mention is kind of a loss of\ntime people feel like they don't\num they lose time like they forget stuff\nthey don't store memories or they feel\nlike time passes really fast like\neverything's happening so fast I can't\ndeal with it\nand I also heard that memory loss is\nassociated with it yeah that's one of\nthe things I meant yeah like by yes\nmemory loss absolutely thanks for\nclarifying that's what kind of what I\nwas trying to say yeah and um so with\ndissociation\num\nwhen one dissociates um what's like what\nis dissociation and what is it not like\nwe already explained like what it is but\nlike sometimes people will say like I'm\ndaydreaming I dissociate it is that the\nsame thing or\nhmm\nso\nhumans are just it's a good question\nMichelle so humans humans we're really\ngood at\num suppressing avoiding distracting\nourselves from our feelings we're really\ngood at avoiding threats we're really\ngood at doing this in lots of creative\nways and daydreaming can be one of those\nbut so can defense mechanisms like me\nlike oh if if I make a mistake at work\nor I'm a little nervous about my ability\nto perform at work I might create a\ndefense mechanism like blame like oh my\ngosh I hate my boss he's such a jerk as\na way to protect myself from feelings of\nanxiety around oh yeah\num around my ability to perform and I\nmade a list the other day of all the\nways that we kind of are really good as\nhumans at avoiding our feelings\nand that that can include daydreaming it\ncan include um just mental avoidance\nsuppression trying not to think about\nthings blaming\num lots of defense mechanisms like\nblaming ourselves blaming other people\num making reasons intellectualizing and\njust straight up distraction\num in addition to like other things like\nkeeping really busy like just staying\nreally busy with something else so I I\nwould consider all of these even coping\nskills can be a form of just\num distraction and avoiding our feelings\nI'm gonna try and cope I'm gonna even\nmeditation can be used as a form of like\ncoping and in the short term these\nthings can work really well just for a\nmoment and then but in the long term if\nwe engage in them too much they become\nhabitual and they stop us from living\nour life they stop us from engaging with\nour problems and solving them and living\nour life Direction because we come we\nbecome kind of dependent on them so I\nwould consider like daydreaming and\nother kind of short-term distraction\nthings as more of avoidance skills or\nmaladaptive cope open skills or defense\nmechanisms I wouldn't necessarily\nconsider daydreaming uh\nit it depends on how it's used so if\nyou're sitting in class and you're bored\nand you start daydreaming and boredom is\nan uncomfortable emotion right but you\nuse daydreaming to like Escape that\nboredom is that dissociation nah maybe\nbecause if the situation got more\nintense like the teacher all of a sudden\nlike dropped a loud book or like started\nyelling at the class you'd pop right\nback into reality yeah I think that's\nthe main difference yeah right like it's\nlike a lot of these distraction\ntechniques they aren't at the peak of\nyour emotions they're like all of the\nlong-term little little emotions whereas\nif you're having a trauma response or\nlike a really strong dissociation\nresponse the world can be burning\nand you're still just kind of like like\nlocked in a little bit\num because it's not it's not it's like\nat the peak level of nervous system\narousal or nervous system activation is\nwhen that dissociation derealization\nhappens now I do think it's possible to\nhave it at a lower level in a chronic\nlevel like these people who experience\ndepersonalization for years\num they they might feel like a low level\ndissociation I I'm not going to deny\nthat that's a real experience for people\num\nbut in general I would consider this\nlike\nif we look at I'm doing this mental\nchart of like okay safety activation\nshutdown and like it usually happens\nwhen we're in the shutdown response not\nwhen we're in like the mid-level\nemotional activation stage\nand um so does dissociation sometimes\nlike severe dissociation maybe cause\nsomeone to be in a catatonic State\nalmost is that almost what it sounds\nlike they're catatonic like it can yeah\nit can yeah it's like severe trauma and\ngrief yep I've definitely worked with\npeople who have\num kind of dissociated shutdown not\nknown where they were we were talking to\nthem we were gently touching them and\nthey weren't able to connect they\nweren't able to re-engage that's\nheartbreaking honestly just thinking\nabout it because I've seen that too and\nso what are some treatment options that\nyou recommend in a situation like that\nyeah so there's there's two two things\nhere so the first thing is like oh if\nyou are in a dissociative episode or you\nfeel yourself dissociating what can you\ndo and then what's the long-term option\nI'm going to start with the long term\noption because a lot of times if you\nread articles on the internet they all\nkind of say the same thing\nwell look at this I'm going into the\nshort-term option okay all the articles\non the internet here's the short-term\nanswer to dissociation right the\nshort-term answer is try to calm your\nnervous system down practice deep\nbreathing use your senses to connect to\nyour environment so um there's a lot of\ngrounding skills most people who watch a\nlot of psychology stuff would know but\nlike re-engage with your senses so one\nof the things they say is like you can\nput a mint in your mouth or even better\nif you put something sour in your mouth\nand I'll tell you why it's all about the\nnervous system when our nervous system\nis relaxed we release saliva because\nwe're releasing digest we're doing our\ndigestive\num stuff rest and digest is the\nparasympathetic response the calming\nresponse so you put something sour in\nyour mouth it releases you get the\nsaliva in there and then um it also\ntriggers your nervous system to calm\ndown which is pretty interesting to me\num so you could taste something you\ncould feel something like this is when\nI'm working with clients who are\nactively dissociated I'm like what do\nyour pants feel like right now and\nthey're like Pat they're legs they'll\ntouch their pants they'll feel the\ntexture they'll touch their face you do\nsight sound touch taste um\nsmell you're like oh what can I smell\nwhat can I hear and you try and\nre-engage with your senses because often\nthe present moment is safe if we can\nre-remind our nervous system that we are\nsafe that'll help us calm down so deep\nslow breathing and sensory stuff are\nkind of the main treatments in a\ndissociative episode when you're right\nin the middle of it\nthe long-term solution\nis learning to process emotions it's\nlearning to work through those emotions\nso that they don't build up so like if\nyou've got a ton of stressors like let's\nsay you have stressors from your\nchildhood those aren't in the past\nthey're in the present moment in the\npresent moment you have feelings of\nShame pop up or in the present moment\nyou have memories that are really\npainful that you haven't worked through\nor in the present moment a little like\nsomething outside happens like maybe\nyour husband gives you a piece of\nfeedback that's like a little bit of\ncriticism and you feel like a little kid\nagain who's getting yelled at right and\nso in the present moment you're having\nthis reaction and you don't know how to\nsolve this problem you don't know\nwhether you're a good person or not you\ndon't know whether\num you don't know how to work through a\na relationship communication issue so\nthe solution to that is like learning to\nwork through relationship problems or\nthe solution to the job experience is\nlike oh\nlearning to either develop the skill you\nneed at work or learning to treat\nyourself with so much kindness and\nrespect that you can handle it even if\nyou aren't good at something right so\nthese are like all just I just break\nthem down into like the tiniest little\nskills and the so the and where do we\nlearn to do these things I mean I think\npeople are awesome people who are\nlearning these skills on the internet\npeople who are reading books and\nimproving themselves but really going to\ntherapy can be one of the fastest ways\nto like learn these skills because\nit's hard to learn them on your own\nabsolutely we're like expected to know\nright but like unless you have someone\nwho's like taught you that since you\nwere growing up it can be really\ndifficult and so is it almost like a way\nof preventing dissociation in the future\nto like knowing how to process emotions\ngrief all of that it helps prevent that\ndissociation in the future yep\nabsolutely you can build skills and it's\nliterally like a like a muscle to like\nwork through really big emotions I read\na book by someone who uh she was writing\nabout uh somatic experiencing therapy\nshe's a transomatic experiencing\npractitioner and she just got she had\nhad some childhood trauma she learned\nthese skills she was practicing as a\ntherapist and um unexpectedly her\nhusband died and she said because of all\nthe skills she had she was so good at\nfeeling her emotions and working through\nthem\nthat she was okay like of course she was\nsad and she was really good at feeling\nthat sadness and of course she felt\ngrief and she was really good at feeling\nthat grief and so it didn't take her\ninto this Panic danger mode it was like\noh I am capable I don't need to get\noverwhelmed I I'm capable of feeling\nthese feelings and being okay\nand I'm not I'm not saying that in a way\nlike everyone should you know be fine\nwhen they experience grief I don't mean\nit like that I mean like we can just get\nreally good at feeling\nabsolutely I could see that like if you\nknow how to process the emotions then it\ncan prevent like a more severe response\nlater on yeah absolutely yep so like I\nlook at some of these clients I've had\nwho've experienced like cptsd and\num so like they'll start experiencing\nthese little stressors like a little bit\nof work like work is stressful and then\nthere's a little problem with their\nhusband and that's stressful and like oh\nthey're running they're worried about\nmoney and that's stressful and you know\nthe childhood environment they grew up\nin they never learned to manage money\nthey never learned to like just base\nlike a basic skill like showing up to\nwork on time and obviously they're\ngetting in trouble at work because they\ndon't have that consistency and that is\none of the symptoms of trauma right like\nlike disorganization like our executive\nfunctioning goes down and then maybe\nthey also feel kind of really shameful\nbecause of this childhood abuse and it's\nlike as we work in therapy we teach life\nskills like oh how to set an alarm clock\nand how to show up and how to go to bed\non time like how to regulate your\nschedule as much as like how to regulate\nyour emotions like okay let's talk about\nshame what are you ashamed of like shame\ndies in the sunlight how do we process\nshame what's the truth about the\nsituation who was really at fault and\npretty soon that shame Reservoir goes\nfrom like 10 to like yeah like two and\nall of a sudden every day they don't\nhave all these like mountains of shame\nthat they have to deal with their life\nis less stressful and they're having\nless and less dissociative episodes as\ntime goes on\nabsolutely and so that brings me to our\naudience segment where we answer your\nviewer questions I'm really excited for\nthis let's begin so Kayla asks Emma so\nevery time I see happy couples I\ndissociate because of my traumatic\nexperiences with a really bad\nrelationship how do I overcome this\nwhoo\nsuch a good question yeah that's a\nreally good question thank you Kayla\nmm-hmm\nso\nthe first question I would ask if I was\ndoing therapy with this person which\nobviously this is not therapy this is\neducation but we're talking about like\nthe treatment the treatment plan so\num what would we do we'd look at what's\nthat feeling what's that feeling you\nhave that seems overwhelming when you\nsee other couples and is it um is it\nsadness or is it guilt like I don't know\nis it\num grief and then I would say can we get\ngood at working through that feeling\nwhat would it look like if we allowed\nwhat would it look like if you allowed\nyourself to feel that feeling for one\nminute\nwow what would it look like if you made\nspace for that feeling and this is a\nreally practical skill from acceptance\nand commitment therapy it's called\nwillingness and I'm not trying to plug\nmy own channel but the reason I made my\nchannel so people could learn these\nskills so if you Google willingness or\nif you search willingness in YouTube\nyou'll probably see some videos\num of mine come up and the idea is you\ncreate a present like so how do you feel\nfeelings instead of dissociating with\nthem right how do you feel feelings\ninstead of dissociating you get present\nwith them you expand you like make space\nlike I can handle feeling this intense\namount of sadness and we don't judge\nfeelings as good or bad we accept them\num\nwe get curious about them so\num you pretend like you're a scientist\nwho has never felt sadness before and\nyou're like taking notes on it like huh\nwhere do I feel sadness in my body huh\nif I were describing sadness to someone\nwhat would it be like we have what\nBuddhism calls a beginner's mind or\nwe're just really curious about it and\nthen\num\nyou can also just soften your body as\nyou feel it like you just like open up\nand make some space while you feel these\nfeelings and you would practice\nfeeling your feelings instead of\ndissociating from them that's the short\nanswer the acronym I just used there was\npeace so like present moment\num you get present instead of\ndistracting yourself you stay here and\nthen now expand accept curious\nI can't remember what the other e is\nyou'll have to watch one of my videos\nfor it now that I'm bringing up my own\nacronym\nbut that's the idea willingness that's\nwhy you're the expert\nthat's why I write things down right and\nyou know if processing that that grief\nor sadness from that Old relationship\nfeels so hard there's a lot of tools\nthat we use in therapy to do it one of\nthem is talking about it\num one of them is letting people cry\nlike can like so sometimes people like\noh I can't feel that feeling because if\nI did I'd cry what would happen if you\nlet yourself cry right they have this\nthey said I can't show these feelings\nand then the third one I would say is\njournaling right so like okay write\nabout it and if writing about it sounds\nso hard do it for one minute that was a\nreally long answer for a short question\nperfect and I just wanted to ask Emma on\nthat so does processing the feeling\num or I mean does sitting on the feeling\nand just allowing yourself to cry does\nthat help you process it\nsometimes yes and sometimes no like\nemotion processing is complicated\nmore than one step and so there you can\nkind of feel the difference between\num feeling your emotions and moving\nforward and feeling your emotions and\ngetting like drowned by them\nyeah and I think working with\nprofessional can help you know like if\nyou're moving forward with them because\nsometimes when you are moving forward\nwith them it does feel like you're\ndrowning yeah but like if you're feeling\nthem I would say like include movement\nbecause that that third stage of the\nnervous system where you're in shutdown\nis immobilization so if you're feeling\nthem and you feel like you're drowning\nwith them try to take some action like\npaint them draw them sing them listen to\na song about them write them down so\nlike we just want to avoid\nimmobilization when we're drowning yeah\nin a feeling yeah we just want to take\nsome action\nthen a lot Alexis asked a really great\nquestion what is the connection between\nADHD and dissociation hmm\nI'll be honest I don't know I will take\na stab at it and say that\num\nif we want to process emotions it\nrequires a couple of different steps\nlike we were just talking about and if\nwe take if we if we look at how ADHD\naffects the brain a lot of its executive\nfunction which is um impulse control and\nmotivation and making yourself do things\nyou don't want to do and organizing your\nthinking and so\num with ADHD\nit's hard to remind your brain what\nyou're trying to focus on with ADHD so\nthat's that's what the executive the\nrole of executive function in your brain\nis is to kind of choose like okay I want\nto be eating ice cream but I'm going to\nchoose to go for a walk or I should be\nworking on my paper and instead I want\nto watch Tick Tock and so like the\nexecutive function kind of\nthe executive function part of your\nbrain helps you do the things you don't\nwant to do it helps with impulse control\nand motivation and stuff like that so if\nyou were dealing with dissociation and\nADHD then it might be a little bit\nharder to redirect yourself from this\nhabitual learned response of\ndissociation like oh you've just been\ndissociating over and over and you need\nto break that neural Pathway to shift\nyour attention back to the present\nmoment would be a little bit harder when\nyou have ADHD because of that executive\nfunction piece\nmm-hmm that makes sense thank you for\nclarifying that and then\num\ntells me as I don't want to Butch your\nname but tells me as I'm someone\ndisconnected detached all the time is it\ndissociation it's hap it's happened for\nmore than a year\nso would you say that's dissociation so\ndissociation is connected with OCD\num and that can happen OCD is no longer\nin the the chapter on anxiety disorders\nin the DSM like they are a little bit\ndifferent but OCD is connected with high\nanxiety and high anxiety about thoughts\nso if someone with OCD\num if this is really OCD where you're\nhaving this thought or an intrusive\nthought and it just keeps replaying and\nreplaying and replaying and replaying\nand you're focusing on that that can\ncause extreme distress and\num that could do two things right one of\nthem is like a hyper focus on that\nthought or hyper focus on fighting that\nthought where you get just as engaged in\na process of distracting yourself from\nthe thought by like doing all these\nrituals to not think of it whether\nthey're mental or physical whether it's\nhand washing or whether you're counting\nin your head or doing something in your\nhead to like avoid that thought or the\nother thing that can happen is your\nnervous system just gets so activated\nso anxious about this thought or so\nanxious about the situation that it does\nkind of trigger that switch and and flip\nyou to\num\nflip it into dissociation so if you've\nbeen feeling like you're in dissociation\nfor a year\nI would say like oh yeah let's treat\nthat like let's definitely treat that\nlike go get some help or\num start to learn the skills\nto deal with that thought differently\num\nand there are like practical skills you\ncan learn to not get engaged in those\nthoughts Cycles\num and again I don't mean to toot my own\nhorn but we do have a course on managing\nintrusive thoughts on my website if\npeople want to take that course or I\nmean there's videos on intrusive\nthoughts out there if you if you want to\nlearn like some really practical skills\nacceptance and commitment therapy\nteaches you to\num disengage from those thoughts a\nlittle bit and it's shown to be\neffective\nthank you and then Elsa asks how do you\nknow if it's the realization or if\nyou're choosing to disengage and it kind\nof Fades out during an uncomfortable\nsituation and you're getting lost in\nyour thoughts\nso is the question here I'm wondering if\nthe question here is like oh is\nderealization something that happens to\nyou and is disengaging something that\nyou do yeah I think that's what it's\nlike how do I how does she's asking kind\nof like how do I know if it's like a\nchoice or if I'm doing it like or if\nit's just something that's happening to\nme uh-huh yeah and I would say I don't\nknow but what does matter is what you\ncan change so um we look at we say uh\nwhat is in your control right now and I\nthink I think sometimes people have this\nidea with derealization or with any\ndiagnosis that a diagnosis like\nespecially mental health diagnoses that\na diagnosis is something that happens to\nyou and that um everything else is your\nchoice and the truth is it's a lot\nfuzzier I'm certainly not going to blame\npeople for their diagnoses like it's not\nyour fault if you're experiencing a\nmental health condition\num but there's usually quite a bit you\ncan do about it so I would worry a\nlittle bit less about like oh is this\nsomething that happens to me or\nsomething I could do something about and\nI would instead focus on well how is I\nwould ask these questions how is it\nimpacting your life is it impacting your\nlife negatively I would ask the second\nquestion would be what do you want your\nlife to be about what are your values\nand this is all straight from acceptance\nand commitment therapy this is the work\nwe do in acceptance commitment three\nwhat do you want your life to be about\nis this dissociation or disengaging\nwhether it's derailization or just\nyou're choosing to disengage they\noverlap right it's a spectrum here\nthat's not just like\none of them is a something that just\nhappened to you it's like the spectrum\nof like okay biology psychology and your\nchoices all add up to make this so\num what do you want your life to be\nabout is this interfering with it and\nthen third what can you do about it so\neither way whether it's intentionally\nkind of\ndisengaging with reality because it's\npainful or that's just such a habitual\nresponse that you learned over the last\n20 years of childhood trauma that you\ncan't really stop yourself from doing it\neither way the same treatment approach\nis I want to learn skills so that I can\nbe intentional about what thoughts and\nfeelings I act on I want to learn skills\nso that I have more flexibility in my\nlife so that I can live the life I dream\nso if I want to be engaging in uh my\nwith my family I want to be engaging\nwith my family but I have these old\nmemories that make me feel ashamed and\nthen I just shut down and then I\ndisconnect from my family I'm like okay\nI want to learn to work through these\nold memories and this shame\nso that I don't disengage when I'm\nhanging out with my family and\nso I would just ask yourself the\nquestion\nwhat can you change and it would be\nlearning\num learning to be more present with your\nfeelings\nEmma and then Hannah asked how do I\nexpress what I'm feeling to other people\nI have autism and it makes it hard for\nme to express my emotions I think this\nis a great question it is a great\nquestion and I think\num it's a really hard question even for\npeople who are neurotypical it's hard\nfor us to like us I don't even know how\nneurotypical I am but it's hard for a\nlot of people to express and explain\ntheir emotions how do I express what I'm\nfeeling\num if we were to take this\nfrom like just baby steps the first\nthing I would say would be like let's\nget words for what you're feeling let's\nlet's develop words for what you're\nfeeling and\num it could be helpful to even just\nprint out a list of all the emotions and\nlike in a situation you could like\nCircle for ones you're feeling and be\nlike yeah this this right\num or the other thing one of my new\nfavorite\num apps and these are not sponsored in\nany way but one of my new app my my new\nfavorite apps is called Lotus bud and\nit's free and what it does is just\nthroughout the day it just prompts you\nto check in with yourself and your body\nso like you can set it to go off a\ncouple times an hour or just one or two\ntimes a day and when it goes off it\nwould you could say okay how can I\nidentify what I'm feeling\nwhat am I feeling right now so low Spud\ngoes off it Chimes you say okay right\nnow I'm feeling excited\nand then you find the word for that just\npractice finding words for it that would\nbe the first thing I would say now the\nsecond thing like people express\nfeelings we're not talking about just\nidentifying that's the first step is\nlike noticing naming what you're feeling\num and then the third step would be\nactually putting it into some other form\nof communication that other people can\nunderstand and the easiest one is words\nbut for a lot of people that's not the\neasiest one and if you're neurodiverse\nit might include\num art or music or memes or emoticons or\num sometimes like you just find a meme\nthat just like speaks to your experience\nand you could share that with other\npeople so there's a lot of ways to\nexpress your feelings isn't that such a\ngood feeling when we find a meme we can\nrelate to right yeah you're like on\npoint it's so relatable yeah facts and\nthen Misty asks how can someone support\nsomeone with the realization\ndepersonalization there's a really\nreally good question because I think\nthat we need to like know we need that\neducation to like support people yeah\nso if someone's right in the middle of\nan episode or like a dissociative\nepisode or they are on like feeling\nunreal\num\nlike helping them reconnect to the\npresent moment like redirecting your\nattention hey it looks like you're\nzoning out a little bit can we come back\nto the here and now like giving little\nprompts like that might be helpful or um\nlearning yourself uh as a as a parent\nright you could learn these skills\nyourself like how to get grounded how to\nhow to ground your nervous system how to\nget present how to practice a little bit\nof mindfulness in a healthy way and then\nyou can teach those to your kids\num with younger kids like sometimes\nwhen my kids are really upset I'll help\nthem just notice like a physical\nsensation oh can you feel how soft that\nblanket is can you feel your teddy bear\num and then on an emotional level\nconnection is the opposite of\ndissociation so connecting with someone\non a real emotional level is the\nopposite of dissociation and connection\nis one of our greatest forms of safety\ndissociation is a defense mechanism when\nwe feel like we're in danger so\nconnecting with them on an emotional\nlevel is kind of an antidote to\ndissociation so having real\nconversations with them making eye\ncontact with them hugging them touching\nthem asking them how they're doing\nchecking in with them on their emotions\nall of these forms of connection are\ngrounding for the nervous system\nokay\nawesome thank you for that and I just\nwanted to\num give a shout out to this person to\nthis viewer before I end the segment I'm\ntelling you I said I love it when two of\nmy favorite channels collab ah thank you\nthanks Antonio thank you thank you so\nmuch and so that concludes our stream\nand our interview today thank you so\nmuch Emma for being here you're you know\na friend of the channel and we everyone\nwas like requesting you on this topic so\nthank you so much for being here today\nthat's cool thanks so much for having me\nreally appreciate it awesome well
