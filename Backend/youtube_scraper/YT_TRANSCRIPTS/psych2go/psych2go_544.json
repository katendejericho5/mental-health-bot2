thank you so much for\njoining us today hello hello thank you\nfor having me it is a pleasure to be\nhere of course we're so excited so can\nyou tell us a little bit about yourself\nand your background\nsure yeah absolutely so um again my name\nis Shawna um like you said I model\num I act I'm um I've been born and\nraised in Detroit my whole life um I'm\n23 I'll be 24 in November so I'm a\nScorpio me too oh awesome\nyeah November 7th\nI'll be so yeah yeah\num got that coming up I'm going to\nFlorida this year um for my birthday so\nI'm getting ready for that that's\nawesome I'm gonna go to South Beach\nMiami\num so I'm going to Orlando I'm going to\nEDC um excuse Marquette I've never been\nwe love cats here at psych2go yeah\nwith the um EDC it's like a music\nfestival\nso it'll be my first time out of state\nso yeah I'm really excited that is so\namazing lucky you\nso starting off when were you diagnosed\nwith Borderline Personality Disorder so\nI was diagnosed\num really way back in like 2018.\num I started seeing um a psychiatrist\nbecause so\nwell I also didn't really get to touch\nbase on on the soft white underbelly\nvideo which um is really not which I\nlove that video by the way it's great so\nmuch I appreciate it so um I've actually\nbeen dealing with um 80d since I was\nlike very young so um I do have to take\na medication for I have to take like\nAdderall for that so for ADHD yes wow so\num but you know that hasn't really been\nreally bother me I mean I have little\nsymptoms but I'm sorry about that\num you know I I have my symptoms with\nthat but you know that's that's it\nprobably has an impact though yeah\ndefinitely it can make things a little\nmore um intense than they need to be\nsometimes like um I just my mind and\nthen but top of my you know my anxiety\nand then my board Like It's just\nsometimes freaking get a little chaotic\nbut um yeah I see my psychiatrist she um\nshe diagnosed me because yeah we um I\npretty much told her um\ntalk you know talked about uh how I was\nfeeling you know my symptoms I brought\nit up to her I pretty much told her that\nI think I might you know be a candidate\nfor such so we um\nyeah we we did an appointment with that\nand I got diagnosed it was uh I I kind\nof seen it coming though it was one of\nthose things like I said like I wanted\nto ask her you know like her opinion on\nit and um you know I just something that\nI kind of all like I just knew I was\nalways like it was more than just\ndepression it was more than just\nanxiety attacks like it was way more\nthan that you know when you do it so I\num yeah all if you always trust your gut\ntoo you know you know I it's just one of\nthe things I trust in my good I knew I\nhad to talk to somebody about it because\nI knew I wasn't going crazy\nabsolutely and was it difficult first\nlike when you heard that diagnosis like\nyou have this did it make you feel like\nhow did you feel about it so\nsurprisingly it wasn't as difficult as I\nthought it was more so kind of in a\nsense reassuring again it was just\nalready\nknew and it was like if it wasn't that\nthen what what was it so in a sense it\nwas like\nagain I expected it like I it was\nsomething that I\nkind of just had a gut feeling about you\nknow doing my research and whatnot\num once I noticed like things were just\nnot the same for me as they were for\nother people so I um again just trusted\nmy gut feeling you know talk to her\nabout it and then we got answers so it\nwas just more so reassuring for me just\nbecause\nI again it was something I knew kind of\nin my heart was it almost like a sense\nof relief like maybe I'll get that yeah\nno that's awesome I love that outlet\nyeah yeah so um you know it still was\nlike okay you know now I have to it was\nlike a wake-up call like now I you know\nthat it's here and we know it's here\nlike not what you know but\nyeah it was still listen to relief and\nso you said that you feel like you knew\nlike deep down and said that you had it\nwhy so like what were like the symptoms\nyou were exhibiting so mainly I noticed\nlike it was how it's like so my emotions\nare just like like I don't get angry\nlike a regular person I don't get sad\nlike a regular person like I've noticed\neverything since I was a child is just\nintensified like everything is just\nintensified everything is just times 10\nlike if some like it would be the\nlittlest you know I was always extra\nsensitive over like the smallest things\nI'd always have like freakouts over like\nthings that I've noticed most people\ndon't really freak out over so you know\nit was just um\nthose kind of things I was like okay I'm\nstart I I feel like there's something\ndifferent or something wrong here\nbecause like why am I so angry about\nsomething that I shouldn't be this upset\nabout like if I were to get into it with\nthe you know like my significant other\nlike I just I get like\nit's a rage like I I almost black out\nit's like it's not even me like the\nemotions are just overwhelming yeah\nmeans like\nit's like a rush of just on\nunneeded adrenaline like it's just too\nmuch yeah and so on that how did you\nstruggle due to borderline personality\ndisorder and how has it impacted your\nrelationships\nso what I really struggle with is again\num my emotions my thinking can be a\nlittle more um like I overthink a lot so\nthat can also affect my relationships to\nlike you know my current relationship my\nfriendships which my friends you know\nthey're all very like supportive like\nthey already know like what's up so I\nlove that yeah so I don't really like\nit's more so my own battles and that's\nanother problem like it's it's never my\nfriends it's never anybody and I'm very\nlike self-aware so with me being\nself-aware of my issues it's like\nI it's like I know it's wrong I just\nlike I I know that I'm mad because of my\nown personal issues or what I'm going\nthrough or because of how I'm feeling\nbut it's like ice my mind still won't\nallow me to like go hang out that day or\nnot be you know not dissociate like I'll\nhang out I'll dissociate because like\nI'm so in my mind or I feel like there's\nlike something wrong or you know that's\nsomething I've also been working on you\nknow like having a like the extra\nanxiety music is like my anxiety has\nbeen my biggest issue lately like in the\npast year since I've done the video it's\nbeen about a year since I did the video\nfor softball underbelly and um my\nanxiety has been getting like really bad\nalso and so do you have intrusive\nthoughts as well like just really\nintrusive thoughts yeah absolutely and\nwhy do you think your anxiety got worse\nafter the video\num I don't think it was necessarily\nanything like with the video I think it\nwas just something like\nI've noticed and then now that I'm like\nI've noticed it it's just kind of like\nI'm now I'm always like I think it's\njust something that I'm always like kind\nof noticing now it's like I don't know I\njust kind of was like oh\nlike I just been really anxious lately\nand then I kind of just been anxious\never I don't know like it's it's weird\nyeah like I just been\nanxious just for no reason like all\nI don't know like I wake up and then\nit's like if I find something to be\nanxious about all of a sudden and I\ndon't know why like I have no idea where\nit came from I think I really just um I\nthink it's just something that I\neventually needed to work on that's just\ncoming\nout of the box you know and something\nelse I have to work on so do you feel\nlike you're more like self-aware\nself-conscious about yourself absolutely\nand that's like another reason why I\nknew\nI was a possible candidate for um\nborderline because like I just I'm very\nself-aware I've always been self-aware\nand that's also an issue though because\nI'm I'm so self-aware that\nmy ego I feel like like makes me feel\nlike I don't need therapy that is my\nbiggest challenge right now I'm trying\nto get myself back into therapy it's\nlike you would think you know oh just go\nto therapy know it\nyou can be really difficult because it's\nhard to find the right therapist\nespecially when again like your\nself-aware and it's like well I already\nkind of have a like I kind of know\nwhat's going on I know what's wrong I\nknow why I do these things I don't you\nknow my back of my mind is like I don't\nneed somebody else telling me you know\nhow to do stuff how to you know how to\nthink you know I already know you know\nit's it's kind of makes you feel better\nyou know battle with yourself mainly\nyeah but it can be hard because\num you want to find a therapist who may\nbe like tailors to like who understands\nand sometimes it's hard to do that or\nsomeone who's gonna give you you know\nsometimes they're a therapist who talk\ntoo much or don't talk enough right yeah\nit's like silence yeah it can be hard to\nfind a good therapist too yeah\nabsolutely and then um what treatment\noptions have worked for you though like\num you mentioned that right now you're\nnot in therapy but what has worked for\nyou\nso at the moment again I'm not in\ntherapy\num I did stop taking\num my medication that was that was\nprescribed to me about two years ago now\nbut um I've stopped I I stopped taking\nthat that's another thing I I don't know\nwhy I did but I talked about that in the\nsoft fight underbelly video as well but\num so my medication I'll be completely\nhonest and everyone you know feels how\nthey feel and mm-hmm it is what it is if\nI'm not like I usually smoke like that\nlike marijuana that's my everyday like\nmm-hmm\ntype of girl but um I've also been for\nthe past like almost two years now\ngetting into um you know magic mushrooms\nand psychedelics I feel like um you know\nand it doesn't have to be like a you\nknow a big trip or you know a bunch of\nlike you know it's you can micro dose\nlike micro dosing it has been proven to\nreally\num help with like depression and um\nanxiety you know mental health in\ngeneral and I can't vouch for my\nexperience you know I might uh micro\ndose like once a while just to kind of\nclear my mind refresh like my mindset\nyou know it really does help out a lot\nand it's helped you like like what what\nsymptoms have you noticed are like has\nit helped with like anger it makes me\nlike think clear like I I feel like I\ncan think more clear when I um like\nmicro dose I feel like um I'm not like\nanxious for no reason like I continually\nget like a peace of mind and feel more\nlike relaxed and you know enjoy like be\ngrateful about the little things when\nyou also have like mental health like\nextreme like borderline personality it\ncan be hard to be like grateful about\nthings sometimes because it's like\nyou'll like at the moment you know I'm\ngoing through a financial issues at the\nmoment like I was just on the you know\njust talking to my boyfriend about how I\njust so like stressed and then I'm so\nlike\nI'm so overworked it's it's so like like\nI can't even\nstink right I can't like I'm I'm not\nhappy but you know like at least I have\na roof over my head I have a car you\nknow I really I need a new one but you\nknow like I still try to be grateful\nabout the little things and that's\namazing it's amazing that like you're\nworking so hard and um that you're\ndealing with your mental health issues\nbut despite that you're working so hard\nand you know doing your thing so I\ncommend you for that that's awesome\nthank you thank you absolutely and so\nyou said that so okay there's a big\nstigma and I think you know this with\nborderline personality disorder the\nstigma is that\num people with BBT are over sexual\nviolent crazy how do you feel like the\nstigmas harm\num you know people who have BPD because\nI think those stigmas are harmful and\nthey're usually inaccurate I know\nespecially because like that's you know\nand everyone's different yeah like I can\njust at least for my case that's I'll\nshow you what I'm definitely not um over\nsexual I think it would be the complete\nopposite like like I'm so like in my\nmind all the time I don't want to be\nover sexual you know I'm so like yeah I\nget angry and violent but it's never\nlike it's like I still have a conscience\nlike I'm still an empist like I still\nhave like a like a like I'm still\ncontent like you know I'm still like I'm\nI'm aware like I'm like I'm I have\nempathy still so like I'm not about to\nsit here and like get extra violin and\nwant to like I've I've never put my\nhands like on my boyfriend or my friends\nI've never done anything like that I'm\nlike I don't you know I've never been\noverly violent the most like I'll get\nlike I'm you know like if I'm really\nangry and having like a really bad like\nbreakdown I might like toss My Own\nFurniture but it wouldn't ever be and I\nhaven't done that in years\num it wouldn't be like ever at nobody or\nyou know never like I don't you know I'm\nnot like a like it's like I'm angry at\nmyself so why how why would I be angry\nat other places like I have no reason to\njust lash out on people like exactly\nwork that way like I'm more mad at\nmyself than anybody so yeah it's like\nit's it's a me thing you know that's\njust for me like I you know some people\nmaybe don't have a control on that or\ndon't want to have a better control on\nthat I do so I'm I make a conscious\ndecision to\nlike you know somewhat you know\nobviously not every time is gonna be\ngreat but you know somewhere\nyou know a ground level and I love that\nyou brought that up because that is like\nthe misconception and the stigma and I\neven heard like in this podcast I'm\ngonna talk about like oh people in the\nmedia or like um in movies and shows the\nway they portray people with borderline\nand someone mentioned Fatal Attraction\nand boiling bunnies I'm like that's so\nharmful and it's so stigmatizing and\ndisgusting and it's inaccurate like what\nyou said I think why do we use like um\npsychosis and um like like real mental\nissues like you know borderline like\nwhich technically if you look it up they\nsay borderline personality is borderline\nyou know that's why it's called that\nborder yeah psychosis but I don't like I\nthink people like use that and then take\nit farther like\nit's more so episodes like I'm like you\nknow I feel like people like you say\nlike overstigmatizing it's giving you\nknow like that's more so someone was\nsevere like mental issues that should be\nyou know in a getting treatment like\nthat that don't sound like you know\npeople with BBT like BPD is not\nwe don't you know we don't you know I\ndon't know it doesn't get like that it's\nmore so just like frogging for me\npersonally it's like um\nuh what's the word I'm with I just said\nit too it's it's like um you know it's\njust it happens like it doesn't it's\njust\nit kind of just comes and goes like it's\nyeah it's kind of hard to explain but\nyou know it's definitely not yeah I I\nagree I don't know why people make it\nsuch\nyeah\nof course like I'm fine you know I don't\nneed like to be in the psych ward like\nI'm okay you know you mentioned a really\ngood point that like um the name of the\ndisorder borderline is uh maybe that's\nwhy sometimes people think that way do\nyou think they should change it do you\nthink it would help if they changed the\nname because borderline makes it sound\nintense yeah like you're bored you're on\nthe Spectrum like no\nlike yeah and it's like right now I\ndon't you know I I'm you know I'm not\nlike a doctor I wouldn't know what else\nto like really call it I'm sure Farley\nthought about it I could think of a name\nmaybe to call it but definitely\nborderline is I think pushing pushing it\na little bit yeah\nyou know it's like how they it's like\nhow they change the name from okay so\nlike how um it used to be multiple\npersonality disorder and they change it\nto disassociative I think that's what\nthey change it to I'm not sure but I\nknow they changed the name I think that\nwas borderline it would help to actually\nchange it because I think that's why the\nstigma exists because the name is so\ndramatic\nabsolutely I I agree 100 I think the\nname is definitely just dramatic\nborderline personality disorder like\nokay\nit's just more so again I just I feel we\nfeel things more intensely than others\nlike that's literally yeah I feel the\nbig difference like\nI'm more so I'm I'm more liable to like\nhalf depressive episodes I'm more liable\nto like have panic attacks I'm more\nliable to have anxiety which is pretty\nmuch yeah you know I'm I'm just I can I\nI can last Shadow like you know it's\njust things that are different like my\nmind operates a little different but\nexactly and you shouldn't be\nmarginalized or stigmatized for that or\nlook as an alien like oh she's a\nborderline a lot of people honestly have\nlike not everyone is perfect so there's\nthere's something with you know\neverybody grenades is it to that extent\nno but you know like everyone's\ndifferent yeah like\nand I feel like there's a lot of more\npeople that are um coming out like that\nare actually borderline and then like\nyou you never would have knew like a lot\nof people like a lot of my friends you\nknow they watch the video they were like\nwow like I never would have knew you\neven had that or we're going through\nthat yeah so you know like yeah because\nI'm not I'm not\nlike the stereotypes yeah you're like\nthe harmful stereotype exactly so that\nbrings me to our audience segment where\nwe answer your viewer questions I'm\nsuper excited and so Lauren asked Shawna\nhave you ever been bullied for having\nborderline personality disorder\num no not for having borderline no um\nhave I went through like\nan elementary middle school and height\nlike have I had like moments where I've\nbeen bullied because of like um my\nemotions or it's usually because of my\nemotions too which is funny\num like I'll just uh like I'll get\nbullied for being like over sensitive to\na certain situation I know that sounds\nstrange but I really would\num you know I would get bullied for like\num lashing out like in in class like you\nknow like not lashing up but you know\nlike I'll like get into the teacher or\nI'll cry like you know like I would like\nlittle stuff like that you know and it\nwould be by my so-called friends too but\num at the time I didn't even know I had\nit so no it's never specifically been\nfor that and the people who do know you\nknow which is mostly everybody now\num everyone that does know has been very\nsupportive so um no as a you know as an\nadult no nobody has ever\nno\num so Victoria this is a great question\nactually how was it for you when you\nfirst told someone about your diagnosis\nso actually crazy crazy story\num I the only person that knew about my\ndiagnosis before I made the video was my\nboyfriend and he\num I mean it was just it was always you\nknow it's that you know like this is\nwhat it is you know it's not something I\nalways gave him the option if it's not\nsomething that you know you don't have\nto stay with me you don't have to deal\nwith like you know I'm not trying like\nyou don't have to that's not fair to you\nto like you know I should at least tell\nyou you know before I tell everybody\nelse so you know he made the decision to\nyou know be with me so we're still\ntogether as far as everyone else\neveryone knew from when I made that\nvideo and\num yeah when I the video came out again\nI've I had support I didn't really get\ntoo many like\nquestions or like nobody really like\ncame like bombarding me with a bunch of\nquestions it was just support if\nanything I just got a lot of like um\ninboxes of pretty much like supporting\nme\nthat's amazing it's really it's because\nyou're being um you're inspiring other\npeople and I think people really see\nthat and it resonates right definitely\nand so then lollipop asked has anyone\never thought you faked your disorder\nhave you ever gotten that like through\nthe internet or just in in real life\num\nI wouldn't no no one has ever like said\noh you're faking it but I did have a\ngroup of friends who I'm no longer\nfriends with that group um I do believe\nat a point granted they didn't you know\nknow the extent of um my issues and I\nwas still figuring out what was going on\ntoo this is before I got diagnosed\num\nI think they didn't like think I was\nserious about my like I think they\nthought like I was like playing around\nabout my mental health that I was like\nlying you know like that I was trying\nlike saying things to like not hang out\nor trying to like you know I definitely\nget that feeling that they\nbecause that's kind of why we we weren't\nfriends they kind of didn't really\nunderstand like\nwhat was going on like you know it's\nokay you don't have to understand it was\nthe way they were going about it they\nweren't very nice to me about it so um\nyeah no they've um I don't think they\never like thought I was lying to my like\nthey never said it to my face but I\ndon't know I've always felt like that's\npretty much why I'm not friends with\nthem no more but no I've never had\nanybody um come up to me and tell me you\nknow like I think you're lying or\nanybody inbox me that or any comments so\nI would hope not I have no reason to so\nbut you know everyone has their own\nopinion I don't know it is what it is\nabsolutely and then um\nTroy asks how did your family react when\nthey found out you had BPD\num\nhonestly so my parents specifically my\nlike my parents\num that was who I was worried about the\nmost uh my other family man I don't\nreally have a lot of family members so\nthe ones that I did find out again all\nsupport my parents did it not support\nlike they supported me but\nif you've seen the video you kind of got\na glimpse of how they can be so it was a\nlittle you know like oh well\nwhy did you make the video like you kind\nof made like they were more concerned\nabout them how they looked you know and\nthat's an issue really like they were\nconcerned about their image yes they've\nbeen doing that for a while though like\nthey they do that\nthey can they do that often which I love\nmy parents but you know they've there's\nalways kind of been a thing with them\nlike if it makes them look bad and you\nknow which my parents have done a lot\nfor me but I think the issue with my\nparents are that um they think me\nspeaking on um a trauma for me or\nsomething that I might have went through\nas a child back then they they take it\nas disrespect or me like wow knocking\ndown their like their sacrifices they\nmade which I've never done I've never\nsaid that like they're the horrible the\nworst parents ever I've never said that\nI've they have done a lot for me you\nknow they have kept the roof over me and\nmy brother's head like you know like\nthat's all very true but you know just a\nclassic case of um\ntad bit narcissism\ndoes it feel invalidating in a lot of\nways yeah you know because it's like I'm\nnot trying to comfort you like I love\nyou I'm still here talking to you and\nthey have yeah you're allowed to tell\nyour story yeah I can still tell my\nstory like you know absolutely and then\nvaishal asked have you often dissociated\nfrom yourself how do you cope with it\nyes\noften\num how I cope with it\nhonestly it's\nI I have to push myself if I don't like\npush myself to like\num clean the house go outside go talk to\nfriends you know I could probably sit in\nmy living room all day feeling\nabsolutely nothing feeling numb to the\nworld like there has been recently I\njust recently like two days ago I'm\nstill kind of getting back out of like\nthat mode because I was just in that\nmode like\nnothing feels right nothing feels real\nyou know I I don't wanna\nlike everything just feels kind of weird\nyou know I definitely again how I cope\nwith it it's a push like honestly like\nif if you don't push yourself to cope\nit's not gonna you're not gonna\nyou gotta push that's really absolutely\nand then have you ever um so they asked\nthe mass and I asked Shawna have you\never ruined a relationship when you were\nsplitting I'm not sure if we discussed\nthe concept of splitting in BPD did you\nwant to touch on that real quick\num we can yeah yeah yeah so\nmy so I've the most\nI'm trying to trying to think because\nI've really only had like bad BPD and\ntwo relationships the relationship that\nI was in previously and the one that I'm\nin now\num have I ruined the last relationship\nbecause of it no we broke up because\nthat you know we just we I agree with\neach other we just had different paths\nthat's that's really why we um broke up\nnow have I ruined this for um no but do\nI feel like it and do I tell him that\nyes I do feel like when I kind of\nlose myself a little bit that um yeah I\ndo feel like I can be I did not\nliterally just have this conversation\nwith him like I feel like I can be like\na bad girlfriend I feel like I can like\nruin things I feel like I'm ruin your\nhappiness like I don't want to do that\nlike I feel bad like\nI I feel like I ruin things but he\nclaims it's not true do I think that's\ntrue not really but\nyou know mm-hmm\nand then ritza asked when experiencing\nrage how can others best support you in\nthat moment I think this is a great\nquestion\nyeah so I actually I know as crazy as I\nget that um I've actually gotten that\nbefore somebody asked me that because\ntheir friend like asking for a friend\nthat has BPD so I um yeah I actually get\nthat a lot but um so\nhonestly\nunfortunately sometimes\nlike you you gotta kind of like for me I\nhave to go through my emotions like I I\nsometimes sometimes you know I just need\nto calm down maybe smoke a blunt or go\nfor a walk you know sometimes I just\nneed to breathe other times like I'll be\nso much built up that it's you know and\nit's so as scary as it can be to watch\nor it's like sad it can be to watch like\nsomebody you care about like experience\nthese like intense emotions sometimes\nyou know it's just best like to like for\nme I need to feel those emotions and let\nit out like I I need to cry for 30\nminutes straight and just scream and cry\nthat's just sometimes what I need to do\nand you know once I let it out I'll feel\nbetter you know I can then I'll probably\nbe able to talk about a little more\nbecause like that's another thing with\nme it's hard for me to talk in that\nmoment like when someone you know all\nlike what's wrong like I can't always\nlike I don't have the words at the\nmoment I feel like I just I need to feel\nthem like I just need to feel right now\nthat's the only thing I need to do and\nafter once I can feel and validate my\nfeelings like in my emotions then I can\nprobably explain it better\nabsolutely\num and then motivational ask this is\nI'm gonna just say trigger warning\nbecause this is a difficult question and\num it might be upsetting people so just\na trigger warning before I ask\nmotivational ask can you ask Shawna if\nshe has ever engaged in self-harm my ex\nhad borderline personality disorder and\nsometimes she would cut this is a very\ndifficult question and you don't have to\nanswer it but yeah this is what she\nasked so um you know I don't I don't I\ndon't mind so I haven't I I used to Yes\num I've never really like I've never\nreally been like a cutter though like um\nI've had a experience in middle school\nwhere I like\ntry to harm myself and then I think when\nI was like 20 when I first moved into\nthis apartment\num I did try to um like cut my like\nself-harm and then I also like had a lot\nof suicidal thoughts so no like yeah\nthat's definitely a thing you know it's\ndifferent for everybody some people um\nI've I've been dealing with suicidal\nthoughts for a long time but I'm also\nlike I'm spiritual so I you know I do\ntarot and stuff so it's like I have a um\nI have a different um and this is just\nme personally for me\num what what made me kind of calm down\non the suicidals which I still get trust\nlike every time I get in my modes I I\nlike I wanna like I can't do it like I\nliterally just don't want to be here\nright now but um I haven't tried to like\ndo any physical harm lately but that's\nbecause I\nI have a um\nnew\nyou know I I I'm going through like a um\na theory with this like I have a saying\nwith like I know in my heart and soul\nI'm not ready to die yet I feel like and\nI know that's powerful yeah I I just I\nknow it like again that's just me you\nknow I do Spirit like again I'm into\ntarot so like you know if you know the\npeople that know you know if you were\ninto it you get it you know it's just\nI'm I know like mine's like I'm just I'm\nnot ready for it so that's what kind of\nkeeps me here and I also I don't think\nI'm ready to see what's after this you\nknow like I don't um you know I have my\nown beliefs so I just I don't know\nwhat's after this so yeah that keeps me\nhere that keeps me grounded\nit's really powerful and courageous that\nyou like um admitted to that we\nappreciate it and thank you for like\nyou know inspiring others because that's\nyou know it's really takes a lot of\ncourage to like admit that it really\ndoes yeah thank you absolutely\nof course and then um how do you see\nyourself this is Nevin's question how do\nyou see yourself if you were alone with\nthese issues and how would you treat\nyourself\nso\nthat's a good question\nhow do I see myself if I were alone\num I think about that a lot um so like\nthat's why it's a good question I think\nabout that a lot and\nI'll be honest I don't know if I um even\nhave an answer for myself like for that\nyet\num I don't I think like sometimes I feel\nlike you know\nI would probably like you know if I'm\nnot in a relationship or if I'm alone if\nI was to be single at the moment you\nknow I have this big plan in my head\nthat you know I used to dance like I'll\nI just go start dancing again and I'll\njust go make a bunch of money and then\nmoney will keep me happy and I'll go see\nmy friends and then maybe I won't feel\nso alone but realistically I know that's\nprobably not how it would happen\num I think once a while I'd probably be\nsitting on this couch all day crying\num I definitely would have been having\nmy moments and I don't really um yeah I\ndon't know if that would always be good\nor bad for me I'll be honest I really\ndon't but um how I would treat myself\nagain I'd probably just try to keep\nmyself at work if I don't want to be\nhome I try to keep myself out if I if I\nneed to be home I would try to stay home\nI try to you know\ndo what I best can do if I were by\nmyself I can still try to do me\nso I'm just taking it day by day\nabsolutely\nand then Samantha asked um how does ADHD\ninterfere with BPD and do you still take\nAdderall for it yes I do still take my\nAdderall for it so it doesn't\num\nreally affects like too too much but the\ndates like you know I'm not every day\nlike I'd say like if like Adderall is\nmore so like when I need to like get\nthings done like when I when I know I\nhave a productive day which is usually\nalmost every day like I have like out\nyou know if I gotta go to work like\nwhich is again it's easy almost every\nday you know how you know I gotta take\nmy medicine but um you know like if I'm\nchilling you know like\ndoesn't really affect me it just it's\nmore so like I'm an overthinker like it\njust keeps me overthinking like\nI just I consistently just if it all\ngets bad together I just I just\noverthink more like that's really the\nonly thing I've noticed like I just feel\nlike I have to go like do like I look at\nmy house and I'll be like oh my house\nlooks so messy and then I'll get into\nlike a big like thing and then I'll get\nupset and then I'll just start like and\nit's like I'll do all this complaining\nabout how the house is messy I'm so\nangry that I I don't even clean the\nhouse you know like it's unproductive so\nit's just it can be a big mess like\nthat's really the only thing it's like\nthere's so much going on you would think\nthe ADHD would like make me want to\nstart doing stuff no I just want to\ncollapse like you know what I just know\nlike I'm that's too much\nand then Elsa asked how would you\nsuggest reconciling with someone who has\nBPD if they keep going silent after a\nlash out on you and you they still view\nyou badly through though you were only I\ndon't know what the last part says but\nno you were only the last Dropout yeah\nso I'm just gonna say how do you\nreconcile with someone who um has bpdn\nhas lashed out on you who's recently\nlashed out on you so\nI would try to you know and there's no\nexcuse like you know BPD you're not like\nyou know like you gotta still try to\nmake the conscious like decision to\nlike on your lash outs like you know\nlike again that's something that I've\nreally worked on a lot so\num you know try not to blame them too\nmuch you know especially if you know\nthey had BPD like it's you know get give\nthem that benefit of the doubt but you\nknow also don't be scared to hold them\naccountable like some people just aren't\ncan't get you know and if that they're\nthe type of person that you hold them\naccountable they're not gonna like it\nthen that's their demons but you know\nhow do you know just just be there for\nthem you know let them know that you\nstill care about them but also let them\nknow that you know your feelings still\ndid get hurt in the process like if they\nlashed out on you like I told my\nboyfriend and my friends like if I'm\never\ncombing it like please let me know like\nI want to talk about it like how do you\nknow I never mean to do that like\nit's for me again I'm an empist most I\nfeel like I've noticed a lot of people\nwith BPD are like MPS so it's like we\ndon't mean it most of them I I I never\nmean it for real like it probably just\nwasn't you know in her right mind but\nstill hold that person accountable you\nknow I love that yeah absolutely\nand then let's see last question when\nfaced with challenges or difficult\nbecause they ain't sorry because they\nasked when faced with challenges are\ndifficult situations how do you\ntypically cope and find Solutions so\nwhen I'm going through difficult\nchallenges\num I'm trying to get back into my\nmeditating uh meditating nope um that's\na good coping strategy definitely\ndefinitely get into your meditating I\ndon't know if you know if anyone's in\nthe chakras if you are getting to that\nthat goes hand in hand with meditating\num I honestly try to\nI it's like I have to\nrevert my mind back like I just it's\nmore so when I cope I I usually have to\nI have to take some steps back and\nreflect like that's that's really like\nhow I cope like I reflect more so so if\nI'm faced with a difficult situation\nit's like especially if I know like\nagain for example now like I have a lot\nof financials I still have to like get\ndone like in the next like week or two\nyou know it's like am I gonna sit here\nand keep crying and keep like stressing\nmyself out keep overthinking keep you\nknow\nbeing upset am I going to keep letting\nmy mind get this way or am I you know\ngonna shed a few tears suck it up tough\nit up and just do what you know do what\nevery other person has to do and make it\nwork you know like when like it's just\nyou got to get up like yeah it's just\nlike how do you it's more so finding a\nway of like how do I get up and like fix\nthis because at the end of the day it's\nstill like no matter what like you're\nnot gonna change unless you make those\nchanges like things aren't gonna get\nbetter like No One's Gonna Come sit down\nand save you unfortunately I I wish it\nworked like that it just doesn't you\nknow so you know you still got to get up\nyou still gotta adult you know I know\nthe adult thing is ghetto but you still\ngot to do it\nit's just but you know it's hard it's\njust unfortunately it's hard in the\nworld doesn't\nsee like uh you know unfortunately the\nworld isn't like oh you know I know\nyou're having mental health problems and\nI know you deal with mental health\nproblems so we're gonna make this a\nlittle eat like it just it doesn't work\nlike that like yeah\nyou gotta gotta cope you gotta figure\nout what work what works best for you\nand go from there you have to be like\nyour own Advocate
