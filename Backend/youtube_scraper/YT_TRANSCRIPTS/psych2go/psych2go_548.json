    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey there.\nThanks for joining us here at Psych2Go.\nJust by watching this video,\nyou're showing a curiosity about others,\nwhich makes the world a better place.\nYou've heard about the spectrum.\nPhrases like, \"I'm on the spectrum,\"\nor phrases like, \"Maybe\nthey're on the spectrum.\"\nBut what does it really mean?\nFirstly, a spectrum in this case\nis a condition or scale\nthat suggests variance.\nMeaning there are wide varieties\nof types that can fit within.\nAutism is itself a spectrum.\nSo although awareness of its existence\nhas increased recently,\nso have the misconceptions.\nThis has led to harmful\nmyths and stereotypes,\nmostly around the use\nof all-inclusive generalizations,\nsuch as any statement\nusing \"all\" or \"never.\"\nYou may not even realize they're not true.\nSo come along with me to learn more\nabout this spectrum.\nHere are six things autistic people\nwant you to know\nwritten by our autistic specialist writer,\nand based on his experiences\nand the experiences of\nothers on the spectrum.\nNumber one, we're not all geniuses.\nDon't deny it.\nI know you're mentally playing scenes\nfrom the movie \"Rain Man\" right now.\nStop, desist, please.\nI mean, we're flattered you think\nwe're super human observers\nwith computer-like\nabilities of calculation,\nbut most of us aren't.\nTrust me, this belief simply sets us up\nfor failure and disappointment,\nfor the both of us.\nIt doesn't benefit anyone.\nThe reality is that we're finding\ncertain basic activities\nlike speaking or making appointments\nincredibly difficult.\nIf you're expecting this uber human,\nwe'll both just experience\nuber disappointment and frustration.\nAdditionally, this pedestal\ngives the impression\nthat we don't need any\nsympathy and support\nbecause we're so gifted.\nNumber two, we're not all beyond hope.\nAll right, so we've established\nthat we're not all human supercomputers.\nAnd on the flip side,\nwe're not all completely, utterly,\nhopelessly incapable either.\nRemember, variance.\nUnfortunately, even well-meaning experts\ncan dismiss those on the spectrum\nas being eternally a drain or load\nwith no ability to learn or improve.\nYou might recognize it\nwhen they use the word \"never\" too much.\nLike they will never graduate,\nnever get a job, et cetera.\nWe appreciate that our\nincreased difficulty\nwith these normie activities\nis being recognized.\nHowever, calling them\nimpossible or \"nevers\"\ndeny us the encouragement\nand guidance needed\nto see if it's even possible.\nWe're at risk of being locked out forever.\nThis \"never\" assumption forces us\nto be less self-sufficient.\nNumber three, we're just as varied as you.\nRemember the whole spectrum thing?\nThe whole point of\nrecognizing the spectrum\nis to show there is a range.\nThinking we're all the same thing\nis exactly the opposite of a spectrum.\nWe're not a \"you've met\none, you've met them all\"\nkind of group.\nIndividuals on the spectrum\nhave just as much variety\nas those outside it.\nAnd it's not just a simple scale\nfrom high to low functioning,\na whole bevy of variable factors\nmake up each individual profile\nincluding, but not restricted to,\nissues with sensory overload,\nphysical coordination or communication.\nAlso, sorry, not sorry, Hollywood,\nwe're not mostly young Caucasian males.\nThe spectrum doesn't discriminate.\nNot by gender, race or age.\nThere is no typical.\nCramming us all into a typical\ncookie cutter isn't helpful.\nNumber four, we're not\ntrying to make you uneasy.\nIt's a well-known trope\nthat the unknown or unfamiliar\nis the scariest thing ever,\nbut it could be illogical.\nNo Spock jokes, please.\nBasically, social things\nthat are automatic to you,\nthings as natural as breathing,\nare things we have to execute\nas consciously as writing an exam.\nStress much?\nAll right, here's a scenario.\nYou talk to someone.\nYou naturally stand or sit\na certain distance away\nthat is acceptable\nto the culture you live in.\nYou look them in the eye\nand break eye contact every few seconds.\nThe other person reacts to something you\nsay with a surprised facial expression\nwith widened eyes and open mouth.\nYou pause and adjust your tone and volume\nto continue the conversation\nin accordance with this reaction\nand the environment.\nDid you think about any of that?\nI mean, did you seriously\nin your head say,\n\"Oh, they look surprised.\n\"I have to react appropriately.\"\nLikely not.\nYou just do it.\nYou know what happens with us?\nWe think consciously of every aspect\nas that paragraph reads.\n\"I have to break eye contact now\n\"and now and again.\n\"Am I too far away, too close?\n\"Okay, the person's eyes widened.\n\"Their mouth is opened.\n\"They are shocked.\n\"All right, how do I respond to this?\"\nAnd our neurology means\nthis can't be learned\nas an autonomous response.\nWe consciously memorize rules\nand scripts for your comfort\nso you can feel\nwe appear normal enough\nto communicate with us.\nOtherwise, we appear unnatural,\npossibly creepy to you,\nand we're shunned or worse.\nWhen someone stands way too close\nor laughs and smiles at\ntotally the wrong time,\nsure, that can be creepy\nand sometimes threatening,\nbut only if that person\nis well aware naturally\nthat these behaviors are not acceptable\nand does them anyhow.\nWith us, we actually have no idea.\nAnd there's sometimes a delay\nbefore our conscious\nthought kicks in and says,\n\"Hey, not the right time to laugh.\n\"And you're standing too close.\n\"Look at yourself.\n\"You are now just staring at the person.\n\"You haven't broken eye contact in time.\n\"Okay, how are you going to adjust now?\"\nUnfortunately, our neural differences\naren't readily visible\nand awareness isn't to the point yet\nwhere people automatically consider,\n\"Hey, is this person on the spectrum?\"\nIt's still, for the most part,\nan automatic jump to \"danger, danger.\"\nAnd this is especially dangerous for us\nbecause we are seven times more likely\nto encounter law enforcement.\nThese encounters often turn violent\nwhen our mannerisms and stress responses\nare misinterpreted as\nsuspicious or threatening.\nJust as a side note here,\nthe most dangerous people\nare often actually\nperfectly charming and charismatic.\nYou know, the too good to be true types.\nNumber five, we're often\nmore not okay than we let on.\nDoes doing all that extra\nprocessing sound exhausting?\nYou're right, it is.\nWe're constantly navigating a reality\nthat expects things\nthat aren't natural\nand neurologically can't be\nautonomously learned by us.\nIt's not a choice.\nWe are forced to manually\nmask our behavior\nto blend in with neurotypicals.\nWhen we mask,\nwe hate to hear that\nwe're acting normal or less autistic.\nLike it's a compliment.\nIn reality, it just means\nwe're very good at hiding\nthe constant stress,\nhours of prep before an activity,\nand hours of burnout after.\nThe endless over analysis,\nyears of trauma,\nand development of majors\npsychiatric and health problems.\nOur average lifespan is only 36 years,\nwhich can be partially explained\nby the increased suicide rate.\nIt's nine times higher\nthan the general population for adults\nand 28 times higher for children.\nThose of us who have been labeled\nhigh functioning or mild by others,\naren't necessarily struggling less.\nWe're just better at faking it.\nNumber six, our reality is not your joke.\nAutism is a real medical\nneurological condition.\nIt's not a choice\nand it's not some curable illness.\nJoking about it or using\nthe term \"autistic\"\nas an offhand insult\nlessens its gravity in reality.\nThe unthinking burns\nallow the stigma to fester.\nIt also allows our\nactual medical condition\nto be lumped into other\nstereotypes and slurs\nthat belittle our struggles.\nIgnorant people see\nour social difficulties\nand label us loners.\nThey see our awkward interactions\nand label us creeps.\nOr they see our troubles with self-care\nand label us neckbeards\nwithout giving a second thought\nto the difficulties\nthat are beyond our control.\nWe're already putting in\ndaily Herculean efforts\nto make you comfortable\nand maintain the basic social norms\nof your neurotypical world.\nWe are running a 24/7 equivalent\nof a marathon, CrossFit, bootcamp combo.\nAnd this is all for you, the normie.\nSo imagine what it's like,\ndespite all of this,\nthat we're dismissed,\nhumiliated or villainized.\nTo avoid doing this,\nall you'd have to do is ask\nor at least care enough to get some facts.\nSo there you have it.\nSix things autistic spectrum\npeople want you to know.\nThis isn't a lecture.\nWe just want to raise\nawareness and understanding,\nwhich we hope leads to true acceptance.\nHave you learned anything new?\nLet us know what you\nfound most interesting\nin the comments below.\nDon't forget to like\nand share this video\nif it helped you\nand you think it could\nhelp someone else too.\nIf you're interested in learning
