and\noften don't feel the need to apologize\nmarriage and family therapist Lindsey\nFerris says Blame shifting is typically\ndone when one person has a complaint or\nfrustration and the receiving partner\nfinds a way to shift the blame back\nmaking the focus and accountability off\nof themselves this sometimes looks like\nminimizing or invalidating your feelings\nfor example they may say that the\nproblem isn't what they did the problem\nis that you got so upset about it it's\neasy to shift blame In the Heat of a\ndisagreement however if this escalates\ninto them continually blaming you
