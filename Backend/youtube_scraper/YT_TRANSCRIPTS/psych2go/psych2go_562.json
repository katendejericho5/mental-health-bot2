    "video_title": "Experiencing ADHD as a Highly Sensitive Person: How Are They Related?",
    "transcript": "hi there's an important message that I'd\nlike to share and it's really my belief\nactually that mental health diagnoses do\nnot begin to explain the impact it has\non someone's quality of life\nso let's take ADHD as an example ADHD is\na neurologic psychiatric disorder that\nis characterized by hyperactivity and or\ninattentiveness that significantly\nimpacts someone's quality of life\nit's a mouthful right like what does\nthat actually mean how does that\nactually manifest in someone's academic\ntheir social their work life and so on\nso that's essentially today's aim to\ntalk about ADHD and to really understand\nwhat ADHD might actually feel like for\nsomeone who experiences it\nI'm Monica and I'm today's host for the\nask and Advocate series\nI am so lucky to be joined by Jess who\nis a full-time content creator and\nmental health advocate\nI'm going to introduce you all to her\nnow hello Jess hi how's it going Monica\nhello everyone\ngreat thank you so much for being here\nit feels like such a big honor I have\nalways been such a big fan of the\npsychical Channel and to be here is just\na dream come true so thank you for\nhaving me\nof course and thank you so much for\nagreeing to share your story can I just\nask if possible like would you like to\ntell us a bit about yourself and to\nintroduce yourself to the sexy girl\nCommunity oh yeah absolutely hello\neveryone I'm Jess I also go buy baby\nblue online\num I'm a ex-flight attendant's turn\nfull-time content creator it all started\nwhen I was laid off from my flight\nattendant job of full career of over\nfive years during the pandemic\num at the same time this was also the\nmark and the end of my two year long\ndistance relationship\num this doesn't this definitely stunted\nwhat I felt was progress in my life\num I was a lot I was really lost as to\nwhether I wanted to go back to school or\nto take a trade\num I ended up taking the opportunity to\ntry live streaming on Twitch with the\nhelp of my friend to set up my Discord\nand also my\njust all my overlays on Twitch itself\num kovid left me with a lot of time to\nthink during this period I recognized\nthat I had a lot of unhealthy\nrelationship patterns\num from this I decided to attend therapy\nweekly and document what I call now my\nhappiness Journey\num on stream for the world to see little\ndid I know I opened up Pandora's Box and\nwas faced with a lot of Library trauma\nI've learned a lot about myself and it\nwas also when I was officially diagnosed\nI hope to use my platforms to advocate\nfor mental health in hopes that it will\nallow people to feel less alone\nand possibly have the courage to reach\nout for help\nI'm excited to share my personal\nexperience with ADHD and HSP also known\nas highly sensitive person\nthank you so much for opening up I know\nit's not easy and to really have the\ncourage to share your whole journey like\nbreakups are not easy\num covid was difficult for so many of us\nso to really document that takes a lot\nof courage and\nwe need more people like you so thank\nyou so much no thank you I'm glad I'm\nable to share this with you guys\nlove to hear about more about your\nexperiences with ADHD and what that\nmight have been like for you know\nstarting a new career as a content\ncreator and navigating challenges\nso in ADHD fashion I was very hyper\nfixated in trying something new anything\nto get my mind off of my long-term\nrelationship and the end of my career I\nwas really at a loss so I've come to\nrealize that ADC really affects my\nattention span organization and pulse\nimpossibility every single day I have a\ngeneral routine that I've built for\nmyself however I still struggle with\nconsistency especially in the form of\ncognitive function and time management\njust doing things that I have planned\nfor my day\num there are a lot of self-reflection\nand obtaining more knowledge to therapy\nand research I've learned how to better\ncope and most importantly to be less\ncritical of myself\nwell that's great and you did mention\nearlier on I picked up on what you\nmentioned a highly sensitive person do\nyou mind elaborating what that\nexperience is like for you\num so essentially being a highly\nsensitive person is a personality\ndisorder and it amplifies my sensitivity\nto external and internal stimuli\num from this I've become hyper fixated\nI'm learning about what could be the\ncause\num applying this knowledge to my past\nhas been both a relief and a source to\nmy continuous confusion as I move\nforward in life\nit really has helped validate my\nsensitivities when I was younger and\ndysregulated\num I always thought I was or I've been\ntold I was a crybaby as a kid and I\nnever really understood that and was\nbeing quite critical of myself\non the other hand it also makes me\nespecially aware of other people's\nenergies in the same room\nit really sounds like you put a lot of\nintrospection and thought into your\nwhole journey and I wonder whether there\nwas kind of a moment when you\nrealize that oh I might have symptoms of\nADHD and I identify as being someone who\nis a highly sensitive person was it\nreally a moment or was it sort of kind\nof\nover time\nit was definitely a gradual process it\ndidn't happen overnight\num I got into a lot of trouble\nespecially in school and at work for\nbeing forgetful and late I would\nrationalize that it was a product of\ndepression this whole time I thought it\nwas just depression that led me to have\nthe symptoms that I did\num I came across the symptoms of ADHD on\nthe internet one day and it really\nresonated with me with some mixed\nemotions\num as for being HSP I noticed my\nsensitivity still sounds and smells in\nparticular broadly High\nI see and was this something that you\ndecided to pursue like formal diagnosis\nfor in terms of ADHD or um because I\nhaven't actually by the way as a side\nside note I never came across a term of\nhighly sensitive person until I read\nmore about kind of the literature around\nit because I think it's not formally\nclinical terms so it's something really\nnew to me and it's also a great learning\npoint I think for both me and possibly\nthe community oh absolutely I do believe\nit's fairly new I also just learned\nabout this diagnosis through my own\ntherapist as well so it was really\ninteresting deep diving into it\num\nuh a little bit more about HSP I wanted\nto add was that\num it this included my emotional\nsensitivity\nand I thought I was maybe perhaps on the\nspectrum of being an over empathizer\num because my heart can't handle\nconsuming too many triggering topics\nsuch as death abuse or violence I really\nhave to be mindful of my state of mind\nbefore engaging in these certain parts\nof life especially with consuming media\nand the process of seeking like\ndiagnosis for HD and HSP during a\ntherapy session I discussed my\ncomplicated childhood with the guidance\nof my therapist honestly the best person\never that has made such a big difference\nin my life and I've always advocate for\ngoing to therapy\num I asked her if my current symptoms\nmay be rooted in ADHD\num at that very moment I was able to\nconnect the dots and I had an epiphany\nthat perhaps it was my untreated ADHD\nthat influenced my depression\nmm-hmm\nit's common that there's a lot of\ncomorbidities so overlapping conditions\nand that one could mask another or that\none could really exacerbate another so\nsometimes it's really hard to know what\nthe root cause really is and I wonder if\nthere was a process for you to really\nfind out that or for you and your\ntherapist together to find out that it\nwas really ADHD at the core of it\num so I after our\nfirst session she had asked me if I\nwanted to do a test and just sit down\nand look at a PDF with her and go\nthrough all the questions\num she carefully explains the meaning of\nevery question and when she put up back\nall the scores it was very present that\nI had ADHD and that's also when I\nlearned that adg came in different forms\nit wasn't always hyperactivity which is\nwhat I thought was the definition of ADC\nat the time\nyes I think that's a really good point\nthat you brought up because speaking\nabout medical misinformation something\nI'm very passionate about by the way I\nalways think that children who have the\nidea or anyone actually has the idea of\nADHD they think of like Tigger in Winnie\nthe Pooh right someone who's always like\njumping so happy full of energy\nyes that is part or can be part of it\npresenting as hyper uh hyperactivity\nright but there's another form in\nattentiveness or mix right so just like\nyou mentioned there's many different\ntypes and it's important that I think\npeople know of it so it's not always\npeople making that connection between oh\nsomeone who's going bonkers all the time\nequals\nADHD you know as an example\noh yeah absolutely and so that really\nturns my world upside down because what\nI thought I knew by ADHD is very very\ndifferent from the truth\nright so in terms of kind of that\nprocess of learning about more about\nADHD were there any resources you found\nwere particularly helpful in kind of\npsycho education in terms of teaching\nyourself and in addition to teaching\nothers who might be around you\ncaregivers and so on oh yeah so aside\nfrom learning more about myself and\nlearning about CPT which is cognitive\nbehavior therapy techniques for my\ntherapist I also look to books art\nprograms and online resources two books\nthat I would recommend are you mean I'm\nnot lazy stupid or crazy and the five\nsecond rule the first book is really\ngreat in trying to teach you how a\nperson with adhd's brain works and to\nhave a lot more compassion towards\nyourself and the second book the five\nsecond rule by Mel Robbins is really\namazing for helping you jump start\nbetter habits because I feel like\npersonally for me I struggle with a lot\nof uh you have a cognitive function\nwhere I just can't get myself to get up\nand do what I need to do and so she\nteaches us this metacognitive Behavior\nwhere you count from five all the way to\nOne backwards kind of like a Rocker\nRocket blasting off and it's just\nsomething so magical about it and it\nreally launches you to do what you need\nto do like for example getting up on\ntime instead of hitting the snooze\nbutton multiple times\num yeah and then a comic artist named\nPina I really enjoy uh they created a\nvisual representation of how it feels\nSusan she'll be a HD alien oftentimes if\nmy friends or my peers don't understand\nwhat I'm going through I find that\nlinking them to a small little comic\nbook uh image helps them visualize and\nunderstand a little bit better where I'm\ncoming from\n[Music]\num recently I subscribed to an online\nworkshop on this app called inflow\ncreated by a doctor who has ADHD in\nitself it provided courses of all sorts\nof topics and it's very very ADHD\nfriendly and that it assigns you a coach\nto keep you accountable and uh it not\nonly provides text courses but also an\naudio portion and you can control the\nplayback speed I don't know about you\nbut on YouTube I watch majority of my\nvideos at like 1.5 or 1.75 playback\nspeed oh absolutely\never since\num kind of realizing the power of two\ntimes beating everything I've only just\nwatched things on two times speed like\nlectures videos because now I can watch\nthings two times as fast and get two\ntimes the amount of information at the\nsame time so yeah definitely with that\nand another thing I wanted to say is\nthat I love how material these days in\nterms of like psycho education comes in\nso many different forms so you mentioned\nLike Comics love that I I still love\nComics I still read Calvin Hobbes I know\nit's a side tangent but I love it love\npeanuts Comics\num love how they're Comics related to\nmental health now I really love how\nthere's also\num things being created by people who\nexperience ADHD themselves because it's\nreally great to know that this is\nsomething created by someone who gets it\nyou know oh yeah it feels so much more\nrelatable in that sense where it's not\njust books it's also YouTube or even\nTick Tock and for example some online\nroosters that I personally enjoy\num I know you guys had the opportunity\nto interview and Dr K from healthy gamer\nGG\num and then there's also Jessica McKay\nfrom how to ADHD and then eventually I\nfound you guys like to go as well\namazing I know it's also like on the\nother kind of\nI think spectrum of materials available\nI'm someone who loves to read kind of\nlike textbook heavy things so for\nviewers who also are into that kind of\nstuff the GSM is the Bible for\nPsychiatry\num it's currently the diet it's the\ndiagnostic and statistic called manual\nfor mental health disorders or mental\ndisorders and I think it's currently at\nthe fifth\nEdition like fifth revised Edition or\nsomething so if people are really keen\non reading really dense texts that's\npsychologists use or clinical\npsychologists use and that's also\nanother resource but I will say there's\na lot of jargon in there and sometimes\nit's not always accessible so having\nthese options as well that you mentioned\nare yeah really great that's amazing\nI feel like I'm gonna hyper fixate on\nthis and just go into like a binge\nreading everything\nit's always such a great thing to do\nthough I feel like I definitely go into\nrabbit holes like just have moments when\nI really focus well right and then no\nones that I don't but in the moments\nthat I really focus about I like really\ndig into a topic and I love that it's\nreally a fulfilling process and uh yeah\nI would encourage everyone to do the\nsame\nso you also mentioned I picked up even\nbefore our shot our little uh tangent\nabout\num the ds7 resources that some of the\nchallenges you faced were things like\norganization and you mentioned some sort\nof like\num things related to cognition as well I\nwas curious to know if there are any\nother challenges you might face\nespecially with relation to being a\nhighly sensitive person and to having\nADHD as well\num so\nI would have to say\nit's very apparent in my daily life\num there has been an improvement of\nquality in my life since discovering my\ndiagnosis and I'm still taking it day by\nday and I'm still working on these\nchallenges I believe it's a never-ending\nJourney for me to learn more about\nmyself and how other people cope as well\nis there anything specific that you\nthink that you learned in CBT that is\nsuch a great resource for example you\nthink it's worth sharing\nyeah I believe having a lot of grounding\npractices such as meditation and making\nsure that you allow\nyourself to have the space to feel what\nyou need to feel in that moment because\nI feel emotions on such a strong extreme\nlevel it gets very frustrating and my\nfirst instinct previously was just to\nblow up or cry\num I believe that now that I can\nrecognize these symptoms from the very\nvery beginning my therapist calls it\nlike the the green light the yellow\nlight the red light if I ever sense the\nyellow light symptoms that's when I take\nmyself away from the environment really\nbreathe and truthfully I've\nwas I had difficulty with meditation\nbecause I couldn't concentrate long\nenough and so what really helped me\nstart with meditation before that was\nthe Wim Hof method where I just focused\non breathing\nvery very quickly like in a certain\nmethod where I just inhale exhale exhale\ninhale exhale exhale and that helped me\na lot with with my emotions\num for ADHD it really helped by using\nresources such as setting alarms to\nremind myself to use a toilet eat food\num and every single time I feel like I'm\nburnt out I just go back to the basics\nmy basic needs and that's to sleep\nenough get my hours in have proper\nnutrition because you are what you eat\nas your summer really produces all the\nserotonin that your brain needs to have\na happy brain physical activity it\ndoesn't have to be much just 30 minutes\na day and of course mindfulness and\nmindfulness if meditation is not your\nthing I find journaling is very very\nhelpful\ndefinitely agree with that and I also\nfind it really fascinating how you're\nable to adapt kind of how you use\nmindfulness to work for you because\nclassically we think of mindfulness as\nyou know focusing on the moment right\nand there's also actually a common\nmisconception that people think they\nneed to be focused but\nwhat I've learned and I think what the\nliterature generally says it's like it's\njust being aware of the present moment\nso whether that's having thoughts that\nare so I don't know distracting or\nwhatever it's kind of like calmly\nbringing those thoughts back\num and like really centralizing yourself\nrather than feeling like you need to\nfocus on one thing per se\num but yeah it's just to say that\nthere's different approaches to\ndifferent psychological approaches to\nbetter feel grounded in the moment and\nthank you for sharing those of course\nI also wonder if there's\nI know with many psychological and\nneurological conditions that\npharmacology is also a whole Topic in of\nitself and I frankly believe that is\nvery important so we previously\nmentioned lots of different\npsychological techniques so things like\nmindfulness things like journaling you\nmentioned\num for me I actually find it really\nhelpful to have a calendar I plan like\nevery minute of my day\num but yeah what are your thoughts on\nkind of pharmacology in terms of\ntreatments for ADHD I'm all for it\num previously I was personally very\nskept not skeptical but very cautious\nabout medications because I don't know\nhow my body would react to certain\nsymptoms and of course the side effects\nwith anything there's always pros and\ncons and I still I think it's very\nimportant to talk to professional when\nit comes to medication but I'm all for\nit personally for me I've have taken\nWellbutrin and essentially in Canada\nspecifically it's prescribed for\num\ndepression and for ADHD but in America\nit's specifically for depression but\nawfully label for ADHD\num when I was first starting this\nmedication I didn't know what to expect\nand I think I'm one of the very few\nlucky people who did not have any bad\nsymptoms such as\num sensitivities to the sunlight I had\nfriends who would break out in rashes\nfrom sunlight but to me personally\nalthough it doesn't uh cure all of my\nsymptoms ADHD it definitely really\nhelped get me into the right mindset to\ngo towards the right direction\num so I'm all for medication I believe\nthat your mileage may vary you shouldn't\ngive up if it doesn't work out for you\nuh be very mindful of what the side\neffects may be and keep on trying if\nit's not for you there are other ways\naround it too like supplements for\nexample there's so many studies about\nwhat supplements are really good for\npeople with ADHD for example I believe\ntaking iron supplements is really good\nmagnesium calcium\nand one main one that has proven studies\nto help improve with ADHD symptoms are\nuh Ginkgo and ginseng mm-hmm I have\nnever really heard of kind of like\nalternative ways I've just been more\nfamiliar with kind of like classical\nways like textbooks ways of treating\nADHD in terms of pharmacologically but I\nreally believe that there's just so much\nkind of variation out there for example\nlike how do we know how do we\nclassically treat ADHD so there are two\nkind of classes like there's stimulant\nmedications you think of things like\nmethylphetal date\num it's an example Ritalin\num Concerta you think of other sort of\nstimulants like um what is it called\nVyvanse a project and then there's like\nnon-stimulants so things like animosity\nwhich is known as Strattera these are\nclassically like medications that will\nincrease norepinephrine in your body\ndopamine in your body and try to help\nyou focus more but not everyone responds\nto them hence the need to look at other\nsort of kind of Alternatives whether\nit's alternative medications\nvitamins\npsychological things so on so I think\nit's really great that there's so many\noptions out there and I think I really\nwanted to bring up this point of\npharmacology just as a way for people to\nbe aware that there are options so it's\nlike if one thing doesn't work which I\nwill say it's frustrating but I would\nencourage to\nkeep trying because\nit's a whole journey and it will be a\nrewarding one once there's a moment when\nyou feel like\nthere's there's something you can do\nabout it and that there's hope\noh 100 and I also went to the point that\nMonica was making but I feel like a lot\nof people may feel some sort of Shame\nwhen it comes to taking pharmaceutical\napproaches and I really don't want you\nguys to get trapped into that bad\nfeeling at the end of the day it's your\npersonal journey and you know your body\nbest and if you've done all the research\nand you've contacted a professional I\ndon't see anything wrong but trying to\nmake the quality of your life easier and\nbetter\nexactly I think one way that I think\nabout it is that if you have a\ncholesterol problem your doctor is going\nto probably prescribe you like a Statin\nlike cholesterol lowering drug you're\nnot gonna feel like oh I'm not gonna\ntake it because like I I've got like\ncholesterol problem similarly similarly\nif you have let's say diabetes you're\nnot going to stop taking your medication\nor like taking your daily glucose level\nchecks because\nwhatever reason like because you feel\nbad I think mental health conditions\nneurological conditions are they are the\nsame they are they are medical\nconditions and they wore the same kind\nof care and the same sort of attention\nso uh just to really second what you\njust said there\nI'm also wondering\num just as a kind of I think a holistic\num perspective of how do you feel that\nhaving ADHD as a HSP highly sensitive\nperson really has changed your\nperspective of life after you know\nseeking help after kind of making these\nadaptations to improve your quality of\nlife how has it all gone how's it been\num it's definitely been a roller coaster\nof emotions I guess at one point I was\njust really confused and lost as to\nwhere it even start\num dissecting where I can improve the\nquality of my life at the same time by\nlearning more about these symptoms and\nwhat's considered normal I've become a\nlot more compassionate towards myself I\nbelieve that a lot of people with ADHD\nincluding myself and others can relate\nto the feeling of being especially tough\non ourselves uh when it comes to the\ndaily life and just the daily tasks that\nyou need to finish\num it's given me the ability to also be\na lot more open-minded towards other\npeople too with other neurodivergence\nmental illnesses\num and that's why I started just\ndocumenting everything online I really\nwant to use my platforms to show that\nyou guys are not alone and there's no\nshame in trying to find out more\ninformation about yourself\namazing and just wanted to highlight for\neveryone watching your links Jess's\nlinks are in the description so after\nthis episode please take a moment to\nsupport her and to follow her journey\nbecause it's really a journey after all\nwith any sort of medical condition\nphysical or psychological it is a\njourney and it's an important one\nso just to finish off today's interview\nI wanted to ask you if you had one\ntakeaway for someone who might have ADHD\nor for someone who might be supporting\nsomeone with ADHD what would that\ntakeaway be\n[Music]\num\nI would say it takes a lot of\nself-awareness to recognize that you\nexperience the world differently and I\nreally like to applaud your confidence\nfor that good on you for making it this\nfar I know I've been wandering around\nlost in the dark for a long time before\nmy diagnosis\num I never ever want you to fall into\nthe stigma of not being normal and\nalthough there's no harm in doing your\nown research my advice would to be to\nspeak to a professional and get a formal\ndiagnosis if possible I know therapy can\nbe costly however I believe it is worth\nthe Investments there are so many\nresources available with affordable\noptions don't be discouraged as there\nare communities that you can seek for\nsupport most importantly remember that\nyou are not alone there are resources\navailable to help you navigate\non your journey of self-discovery and\nself-acceptance I am proof that of that\nand there's so many successful people\nout there with HD such as Justin\nTimberlake Trevor Noah Einstein Emma\nWatson and our wonderful host who's a\nmed student Monica\nyes thank you so much and yes if I were\nto also add to that message you were\nsaying about you know seeking help\nseeking therapy and all that really you\nare an investment and I would encourage\neveryone as well to if they feel\ncomfortable to seek help and do\nsomething about it because there's just\nso much to it's a whole journey there's\njust so much to experience and it's\nreally a learning process so\num that's all I have to say on my end\nthank you so much\nno thank you and thank you everyone for\ntuning in I really appreciate this\nopportunity\nyes thank you to all the psych2goers as\nwell thank you to Jess and if you have\nany comments questions or feedback\nplease leave it in the comments I'll try\nto get back to every one of them bye bye\nIreland"
