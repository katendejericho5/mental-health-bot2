    "transcript": "it's only somewhat true that ADHD and\nTrauma merely show similar symptoms for\nmany years researchers believed that\nADHD was genetic or only caused by a\nchange in the brain structure Science\nNow shows there's a strong association\nbetween childhood trauma and adult ADHD\naccording to a survey up to 17 of\ntrauma-exposed children meet the ADHD\ncriteria as well\nso what is the link between trauma and\nADHD the American Psychological\nAssociation defines ADHD attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder as a\nbehavioral symptom characterized by six\nor more symptoms categorized as either\ninattention and or inactivity these\nsymptoms usually hinder social academic\nor occupational functioning and begin to\nappear before the age of seven\nwhile trauma is an emotional response to\na disturbing experience resulting in\nextreme fear anxiety or other deep\npsychological upsets such as\ndissociation helplessness confusion and\nother disruptive feelings\nalthough we've seen portrayals or have\nsocietal Notions as to what ADHD is and\nwhat it looks like recent studies point\nto its correlation to trauma to truly\nunderstand ADHD we must try to\nunderstand where it comes from\nhowever while comparing both conditions\nit's important to understand that in\nPsychology nothing is black and white it\nsays James M Greenblatt MD medical\ndirector at Psychiatry redefined and\nauthor of The ADHD book finally focused\nmeaning that drama does not directly nor\nimmediately cause ADHD or not all ADHD\nis a result of trauma a 2018 survey\nconducted by Paul fruen and his team\nlifetime traumatic stressors and adverse\nchildhood experiences found that many\nADHD patients experienced form of Early\nChildhood trauma or trauma suffered in\nutero these traumatic events became\nstressors with long lasting consequences\nin some the consequences were expressed\nas ADHD when they reached adulthood this\nnew study breaks the old thinking that\nADHD only expresses itself during early\nchildhood a 2019 study by zoning Chang\nand colleagues associations between\nadverse childhood experiences and health\noutcomes in adults aged 18 to 59 years\nexplains how adverse childhood\nexperiences change the structure and\nfunctioning of the brain making these\nchildren more at risk of developing\nmental or somatic disorders\nbecause adverse child experiences also\nknown as Aces alter cognitive and\neffective processing and heightens\nsensitivity to stimuli it's no wonder\nthat Aces can cause ADHD this study is\nfurther backed by a 2017 study that\ncompares Aces scores and indices to ADHD\ndiagnosis and severity\nthe study found that children with ADHD\nhad had more traumatic experiences in\ntheir childhood than other children\nnow to be clear trauma or Ace does not\njust Encompass physical trauma but also\nemotional and sexual trauma neglect\nsocioeconomic hardship familial mental\nillness neighborhood violence and other\nfactors these researchers found a\nsignificant correlation between a\ntraumatic childhood event and the\nseverity of ADHD interestingly enough\nADHD does not only express itself during\nchildhood\nit can also manifest itself in adulthood\nbecause the aces or trauma cause long\nlasting changes these changes may take a\nwhile depending on the social\nenvironment to manifest\na 2013 study published by Kevin M Angel\nand colleagues post-traumatic stress\ndisorder and adult attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder clinical features\nand familial transmission\nas well as many other studies find that\nadults with post-traumatic stress\ndisorder PTSD or even cptsd are more\nlikely to have ADHD\nin adults both these conditions are\npresent difficulty concentrating\nirritability or heightened sensitivity\nrestlessness and difficulty sleeping\nbecause both present similar symptoms\nit's difficult to untangle them from one\nanother\nso how do you heal from trauma and ADHD\ntreatment for both conditions differs\nfrom person to person some do well with\nCBT or DBT therapies While others choose\nmedication there is a theory that\npresents neuroplasticity as an answer\nbecause trauma fundamentally Alters the\nway your brain processes information\nwhile storing your neuroplasticity and\nreframing your perception and how your\nbrain processes information may be\nhelpful it's always a good idea to seek\nprofessional help to choose the most\nsuitable treatment\ndid you know about the links between\ntrauma and ADHD what are your thoughts\non what you've learned let us know in\nthe comments below if you enjoyed this\nvideo and found it helpful please\nconsider liking and subscribing to our\nchannel for more content like this your\nsupport means a lot to us and helps us\nto continue creating valuable content\ndon't forget to hit the notification\nBell so you never miss an upload see you\nin the next video thanks for watching"
