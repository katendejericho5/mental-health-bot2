    "transcript": "what are some manipulative behaviors how\ncan you spot them and most importantly\nhow do you deal with it\nnumber one playing the victim guess who\nplays the victim game the best\nmanipulators\nin order to get what they want they make\nthemselves seem like victims or Martyrs\nthey say things like nobody understands\nme they feel sorry for themselves and\nwant to make others feel the same way by\nacting this way they're trying to gain\nyour sympathy and make you feel bad if\nyou don't help them or do as they say\nthey keep throwing pity parties for\nthemselves and make everyone else seem\nlike terrible people who are plotting\nagainst them\nnumber two gaslighting no that didn't\nhappen it's all in your head you're just\noverreacting again\nclassic manipulator lines making you\nquestion your own reality also known as\ngaslighting manipulators use this\ntechnique when they want to make you\nbelieve that what you think or remember\nis wrong\nwhen they first start you might be\nconfused because why do you remember the\nsituation differently but after some\ntime you may start blindly believing\nthem and questioning your own mind you\nmay even start feeling like you're going\ncrazy and that's what makes this\nmanipulative Behavior dangerous for your\nmental health\nnumber three passive aggression another\nbehavior that manipulators exhibit is\npassive aggression passive aggression\nmeans indirectly expressing anger then\ninstead of directly saying how you feel\na passive aggressive person desperately\nneeds to feel dominant and in control\nand they do it by making others feel\ninadequate they often have sarcastic\nremarks tease you about your\ninsecurities often pick fights or give\nsilent treatments if you don't fulfill\ntheir wishes\nnot only do they feel these tactics can\nensure they get whatever they want from\nothers but it also makes them relive\ntheir own feelings of deficiency\nnumber four guilt tripping manipulators\nknow that people will do things out of\nguilt so when they want to manipulate\nyou into doing something they might use\nguilt tripping with the strategy they\nmake you feel bad about yourself so you\nend up doing things even if you really\ndon't want to do the things\nmaybe it's going out with them even\nthough you're too tired or helping them\nwith something even if you're just too\noverwhelmed with your own\nresponsibilities they might say things\nlike oh but I do so much for you why\ncan't you return the favor or well I\nguess I don't mean that much to you\nanyway\nby using guilt they make you feel like\nyou owe them something or make you seem\nlike a bad person\nand at first you feel like helping them\nwould make you feel better but it makes\nyou feel miserable instead and number\nfive using cruel humor\nlaughter in this case is not always the\nbest medicine\nthis last tactic that manipulators often\nuse is meant to poke at your weaknesses\nthat make you feel insecure if they make\nyou look and feel bad they get a sense\nof psychological superiority and think\nthey gain power over you they know your\nsoft spots no matter if it's your looks\nsome embarrassing thing that happened to\nyou or your recent breakup they'll bring\nit up like they're saying a joke and act\nsurprised when you say it's not funny\nthey'll just simply say why can't you\ntake a joke even though they know very\nwell it's not just a joke\nso what do you do this is how\nmanipulative Behavior looks but how do\nyou protect yourself from it no remember\nyou're right it's not easy to remember\nyour worth when you're being manipulated\nyou may feel like you can't really trust\nyourself anymore but that's why you\nshould remember the basic rights you\nhave as a human everyone deserves to be\nhappy right everyone deserves to have a\nchoice to have boundaries to be valued\nby others if you believe other people\nhave those rights you do too tell\nyourself something kind every day and\nactively choose to respect and love\nyourself in spite of that person who\nmakes you feel the opposite and distance\nyourself if possible try getting away\nfrom that person as far as you can don't\nreturn their calls or answer their texts\nunless it's really important\nif they ask you to meet use the good old\nI'm busy excuse if you unfortunately\nlive together try going out for a bit\nwhen they become too much to handle you\ncould also try inviting someone over\nsince they're less likely to show their\ntrue colors if someone else is watching\nalso don't give any meaning to what they\nsay\nafter or even during a conversation with\nthem challenge every word they say\nwhy would what they say be true did they\nsay that because they have your best\ninterest at heart is there a good and\nrational reason for you to believe them\nwould someone else behave the same\ntowards you finding faults in their\nwords could make it easier for you to\nbreak free from their influence and ask\nfor advice sometimes all we need is a\nchange in perspective so when a\nmanipulator tries to sell you their own\nreality it would be a good idea to use a\ndifferent set of eyes\nif there's a person you trust call them\ntell them about what's happening and ask\nfor their opinion maybe they'll be able\nto give you more insight and make you\nsee that other perspective that the\nmanipulator doesn't want you to see\nin the end the most important message is\nthis\nif you are being manipulated it's not\nyour fault how people act towards you\nand the choices they make are not in\nyour control\ntry to be gentle on yourself as much as\nyou can maybe test out some of the\nadvice here you're not alone in this and\nthere's always someone happy to support\nyou even if it's a comment section full\nof strangers we got your back uh and\nwe'll be straightforward with you we\nlike the likes and it helps us keep\nmaking these videos so if you tap that\nlike button we definitely do appreciate\nit thanks
