well either\nway welcome it can be difficult to\ndiscuss or even simply contemplate your\nsexual desires and Fantasies you may\nfeel stressed or anxious thinking some\nof your sexual fantasies or thoughts are\ntaboo or unusual but odds are some of\nthem may be more common than you think\nand we're gonna dive deep into the most\ncommon sexual fantasies discussing them\nthat is from a psychological standpoint\nwhy do people have sexual fantasies\nwhat's the reason you may remember that\nthere's a few reasons if you watch the\nfirst part in our most common sexual\nfantasy series in part one we discussed\nthe results of a survey of over 4 000\nAmericans in a psychology today article\nby psychologist Justin lemiller the most\nreported reasons for participants in the\nsurvey were simply to experience sexual\narousal while 69.8 percent of Americans\nreported they had sexual fantasies\nbecause they were curious about\ndifferent Sensations and sexual\nexperiences following that participants\nreported having these fantasies to meet\nunfulfilled sexual needs Escape reality\nfor a while or to express or fulfill his\nsocially taboo sexual desire see lots of\npeople have seemingly taboo sexual\nfantasies which is why it's important to\ndiscuss this topic according to an\narticle from Insider evidence suggests\nthat those who have sexual fantasies\nexperience less anxiety and a greater\nsense of self-esteem so what are these\nseemingly taboo thoughts well here are\nthree more of the most common sexual\nfantasies\nhomoroticism and gender bending\naccording to Insider gender bending is\nwhen a person challenges societal\nexpectations of their gender anyone\nregardless of sexual orientation can\nparticipate in gender bending for\nexample someone participating in a drag\nshow might be participating in gender\nbending\nsome may get the term gender bending\nconfused with transgenderism but they're\ndifferent according to Insider\ntransgenderism is when someone has a\ngender identity or gender expression\nthat differs from their assigned to sex\nat Birth but what about homoeroticism a\n2019 paper published in Social forces\nsuggested that 3.6 to 4.1 percent of men\nand 7.6 percent to 9.5 percent of women\nreported having a level of romantic or\nsexual attraction to the same sex\npalmoloroticism is another common sexual\nfantasy it's when one has sex with or\nparticipates in sexual acts with someone\nof the same sex as them\nyou don't need to identify as queer or\nhomosexual to fantasize or experience\nhomoeroticism it's quite common for\nheterosexual people to have this fantasy\nas well an article from Insider explains\nthat sexual desire is not an either or\nsituation nor does it Define your sexual\nidentity for example a heterosexual\ncisgender woman who is in a sexually\nfulfilling relationship with a cisgender\nman can still have fantasies about other\nwomen\nsex therapist and clinical social worker\nDeborah Fox believes sexuality is on a\nbell curve or Spectrum she explains to\nInsider that people might identify as\nstraight but they can have a little\ntitillation about you know imagining or\neven engaging in same-sex sexual acts\nFOX also adds that some heterosexual\npeople do have sex with the same gender\nperson occasionally having that\nhomosexual fantasy I don't think it\nnecessarily means anything about their\nidentity in and of itself\nRomance\nperhaps one's most common sexual fantasy\nis a romantic evening with their partner\nin The Miller's same survey he found\nthat 87 percent of gay and bisexual men\nand women 88 of straight women and 91\npercent of straight men fantasize about\ntheir current romantic partner it's\ncommon for many people to fantasize\nabout romantic sex\nwhat that means is different for each\nperson romantic sex May mean a candlelit\npassionate night with your lover or\npartner or maybe tantric sex is often\nthe focus of your romantic fantasies\ntantric sex is often a slower sexual\nexperience that focuses on connection\nand the feeling of the experience\noverall not focusing on orgasm as the\nmain goal Healthline explains that when\nyou practice Tantra you and your partner\nlearn to be physically aware and\nspiritually present feeding each other\nenergy that continues to grow well after\nyou've finished having sex I'll find\nalso adds that Tantra also allows you\nboth to explore and expand all aspects\nof your personalities so that you begin\nto truly know the other person inside\nand out\nvariety and Novelty sex\nwant a bit of Adventure some people may\nwant to spice things up in the bedroom\nor out of it one common sexual fantasy\nis having sex in a new or exciting\nlocation under a waterfall on a private\nplane okay well maybe some of those will\nhave to stay fantasies but maybe just\nnot in the bedroom this time\ndo keep in mind in the United States\npublic sex is illegal so some locations\nmay just very well be in your fantasies\nsome people may just want a bit of\nnovelty or Variety in their sex life\ntrying out a new sexual activity sexual\nposition or simply a new location are\nall common fantasies and desires\naccording to sex educator Cassandra\nCorrado with oh School\nthe feeling of facing the unknown and\ntrying something for the first time can\ngive you a thrilling adrenaline kick and\nfor some people arousal is connected to\nthat feeling of adrenaline\nso will you be mixing things up in or\nout of the bedroom there's quite a lot\nof sexual fantasies out there and these\nare just some of the most common ones\nthe most important thing to remember is\nthat these sexual fantasies are often\nnormal and it's all right to fantasize\nand explore your sexual desires and\ninterests if you have a
