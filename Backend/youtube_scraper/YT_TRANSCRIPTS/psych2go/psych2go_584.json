    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Dr Ola Kenosha\nalso referred to as Dr K he is the host\nof his own amazing YouTube channel\nhealthygamer which is a mental health\nplatform that has been viewed by\nmillions of people worldwide he's also\nthe co-founder of the healthy gamer\nFoundation welcome Dr Kate thank you so\nmuch for joining us today thank you so\nmuch for having us Michelle I appreciate\nit of course so can you start off by\ntelling us a little bit about yourself\nand your background\nsure so\num I grew up in Texas and uh played a\nlot of video games struggled a lot with\nvideo game addiction myself basically\nfailed out of college went to India\nto find myself uh stated a lot of\nmonasteries and stuff decided to become\na monk and then seven years later\ndecided that that was not the path for\nme went to med school became a\npsychiatrist and then thought that a lot\nof what we understand about Psychiatry\nneeded to kind of be modernized and sort\nof translated to the digital generation\nwhich is why we started healthygamer\nabsolutely and you're a Harvard trained\npsychiatrist which is really impressive\nyeah so I I trained and was a faculty at\nHarvard Medical School that's correct\nwonderful so just to start off with the\nfirst question Dr K how would you define\noppression and anxiety\nyeah so it's a it's a great question so\nlet's start by understanding that\ndepression and anxiety are emotions\num right so and so a lot what's\nhappening right now in\nour society which is great is that\nthere's a lot more information and\nawareness about mental illness so\nsometimes people are using those terms\nto refer to clinical things so when we\nkind of talk about a diagnosis of let's\nsay a mood disorder like major\ndepressive disorder or bipolar disorder\noftentimes when people say I have\ndepression that's kind of what they're\nreferring to\num similarly anxiety is just an emotion\nthat everyone experiences but what we're\nseeing is that anxiety disorders are on\nthe rise and what we sort of think about\nin in terms of like a lot of people will\nwonder okay do I have a diagnosis or not\nwhat we sort of really think about as\nclinicians is whether it impairs your\nfunction so what's the difference\nbetween someone who worries a lot and\nsomeone who has an anxiety disorder is\nis the amount of worry that you\nexperience interfering with your life in\nsome way keeping you from doing school\nwork keeping you from being social\nkeeping you from like advancing\nprofessionally and if it's really\ncausing a problem it is a problem\nabsolutely and um so like on that so\naccording to WebMD the chance of\nacquiring depression is much higher when\nan anxiety disorder already exists about\n60 of people with anxiety also have\nsymptoms of depression and vice versa Dr\nK can you explain to our viewers how\ndepression and anxiety go hand in hand\nabsolutely so there are a couple of\ndifferent angles on this the first thing\nthat we need to understand is that\nif you grow up as a teenager with some\nother psychiatric illness there is a\nvery high chance you will also be\ndiagnosed with a depressive disorder\nlater in life so if you have anxiety as\na teenager about two-thirds of people\nwill grow up to also have a mood\ndisorder\num\nthat's of the comorbid populations\nthere's a slight kind of uh caveat there\nand then the same is actually true of\nADHD and the reason for that is that if\nwe kind of think about okay what makes\nus healthy well-adjusted individuals\nit's having a normal adolescence\nbasically and what we see in people who\ngrow up with ADHD or have anxiety\ndisorders is that they miss out on a lot\nof very common experiences that like\nnormal teenagers should have so your\nanxiety will keep you from going to\nparties will keep you from making\nfriends you'll worry so much about a\ntest that you won't be able to sleep at\nnight and the next day you kind of wake\nup and like\nlike your mind isn't functioning\nproperly and then you do poorly on the\ntest anyway which kind of you know\ncauses a vicious cycle so that that's\none thing that we sort of know is that\nif you have an anxiety disorder your\nrisk of of developing depression\nactually increases but there's more to\nit than that so we also know that both\nif we look at treatments for mood\ndisorders and anxiety disorders\noftentimes we'll use serotonurgent\nserotonin boosting medications in both\nand so what we kind of know is that when\npeople have quote unquote low serotonin\nalthough their serotonins may not be low\num serotonin is like a neurotransmitter\nthat governs like contentment and\nwell-being and boosting serotonin in\nboth of those illnesses seems to help\npeople like feel better so there may be\ncommon like neurotransmitter stuff kind\nof going on\nand then the other thing that's really\ncommon about the two is that oftentimes\nthey'll have like cognitive filters so\nwhat I mean by that is that people with\nanxiety will ignore reassuring\ninformation and will actually be hyper\nVigilant to scary information and people\nwith depression will sort of do the same\nthing where they'll ignore things that\nwould make them feel good and will sort\nof focus on the things that will kind of\nmake them feel bad so we know that\nthere's like cognitive biases or\ncognitive filters in both cases that\noftentimes intersect\nand in one of your videos and it was so\ninteresting you actually mentioned that\nthere's a correlation between depression\nand high IQ and that people with\ndepression tend to actually be very\nlogical about it yeah so so there's\nthere's some data that suggests that\nIQ and depression kind of go hand in\nhand\num there are many cases where that's not\nthe case but one of the things that's\nreally interesting is that oftentimes\npeople with with high IQs suffer in a\nslightly different way with depression\nbecause if we think about what\ndepression is it's basically your mind\nbeing turned against you so whereas your\nmind normally gives you like reassuring\ninformation gives you reassuring\nanalyzes in the mind of someone who's\nsuffering from a mood disorder their\nmind is like calculating in the wrong\ndirection but if we think about IQ\nthat's like your power to calculate so\nwhat we sometimes see is that people\nwith depression have very high IQ they\ncan they can really it's almost like\nthat IQ is being turned against them and\nthey're very good at providing evidence\nand Analysis to conclude that they're\nkind of like screwed in life and there's\nno point and stuff like that you know\nthat makes sense that really does so the\nhearing statistics show that depression\nexacerbated by anxiety has a much higher\nsuicide rate than depression alone in\none study 92 percent of depressed\npatients who had attempted suicide were\nalso plagued by severe anxiety research\nalso shows that when anxiety occurs\ncomorbidly with depression the symptoms\nof both depression and anxiety are more\nsevere compared to when each disorder\noccurs alone so Dr K can you explain why\nthe symptoms are so much more severe\nwhen these two disorders occur together\nyeah absolutely so there's kind of like\na high level answer and a more detailed\nanswer so on a high level answer we have\nto understand that the human body brain\nand mind are like one unit\nand if you're trying to deal with\nmultiple things at once your body just\ndoesn't have the capacity to like fight\noff two different things so if I'm\nstruggling with for example like a skin\ninfection and covid at the same time\nthat's like more than my body can handle\nnormally dealing with either one is\nrequires my whole body's attention and\nwe also see that in mental illness where\nanytime you've gotten multiple illnesses\nat play it's kind of like more than your\nbody or brain or mind can handle we also\nknow that there are some ways that these\nthings will like intersect so now\ngetting on to more details where if we\nkind of think about okay like if I'm\nstruggling with a mood disorder not\nlet's say I've got depression what are\nthe kinds of things that I would do to\nprotect myself or help myself I would\nmaybe go find a therapist or go reach\nout to some people for help or support\nreach out to friends and if we kind of\nthink about if I also have anxiety well\nthen like what's that going to do it's\ngoing to be like well maybe the\ntherapist like has better people to see\nand you don't really need their help and\nyour anxiety is going to prevent you\nfrom getting help for your depression\nyour anxiety will keep you from reaching\nout to friends because oh like you'll\nhave these kinds of it's like why would\nthey want to bother with me they're out\nthere having fun and if I go and I'm\ndepressed like you know I'm going to\nruin their day\nso oftentimes the anxiety gets in the\nway of the things that would help\ndepression and it works the other way\ntoo where let's say I have crippling\nanxiety and I've got really bad social\nanxiety but I have trouble getting out\nof bed in the morning because I'm in the\nmiddle of a major depressive episode so\nI skip my appointment miss my\nappointment miss work and then my\nanxiety kind of piles on top and it's\nlike well I've missed a week at work I'm\nreally worried about going back so the\ntwo can really like intersect in a very\nunhealthy way\nwow that's like a very interesting\nInsight that like the anxiety gets in\nthe way of actually getting help for\nsomething that you need for the\ndepression so wow and so then what are\nsome of the mental barriers that keep\npeople stuck in a cycle of depression\nand anxiety\nso this is what's tricky I mean I think\nthat oftentimes\nif we look at these illnesses\npart of the nature of the illness is\nthat it keeps us stuck\nexcuse me so if we think about someone\nwho's got let's say a mood disorder part\nof the problem is that when you have a\nmood disorder\nit makes\nyou think about the future in a very\nnegative light right so if you've got\nlike a depressive episode you're you're\ngonna you're gonna feel hopeless\nand so then if you kind of think about\nit what keeps us stuck is like well if\nit's hopeless like what's the point in\ngetting treatment so subjectively you\nknow there are some thoughts that I've\nseen patients have over and over and\nover again and that people like have\nthese kinds of thoughts it's it's\ninteresting because\nyou should definitely get help so here\nare just some some examples the first is\nlike if I get help it won't work for me\nor sometimes even I've tried to get help\nand it hasn't worked nothing will work\nI'm a hopeless kind of case or these\nkinds of thoughts like people have\nbetter they're better patients out there\nwho deserve help more than I do so these\nkinds of thoughts\nwill sort of get in the way of us\nseeking help and that's that's kind of\nthe feature of the the illness itself so\nI kind of think about a mood disorder in\nsome ways is like the HIV of the mind so\nif we think about HIV it attacks our\nimmune cells so it attacks the part of\nus that actually fights infection and\ndepression actually does the same thing\nwhere if we think about when we're\nnormally struggling what do we do we\nreach out for help we ask for support\nbut depression makes us think that\nreaching out for help will be completely\nuseless and so it attacks our ability to\nactually get help yeah\nso with that being said how do we defeat\nthese mental barriers and how does one\nEmpower themselves to seek mental health\ntreatment yeah it's it's a great\nquestion I think we've got to be a\nlittle bit careful with our language so\nI really appreciate the positivity of\nyour language but I think using the word\ndefeat like how do we defeat cancer you\nknow it we'll use that language too and\none of the things that we've learned\nfrom cancer research is that\nif some people beat cancer but then if\nyou don't win does that like kind of\nmake you a loser so so I I think we've\ngot to be a little bit I bet yeah from\nthe approach of like empowerment yeah\nI'm with you I'm with you I I know where\nand that that's the challenge right is\nthat we use some of these words I didn't\nmean to call you out there but like no I\nthink you've got to be careful because\nthe first is you're that implies that\npeople with depression aren't empowered\nright in some way which is which is kind\nof interesting because I think that what\nwe really have to do and that's kind of\nweird but what I found is very useful\nand this may be sort of like the\nbackground as a monk is that it's not\nabout defeating depression it's about\nactually accepting it and living with it\ncan be just as useful recognizing that\nhey this is sort of like part of the way\nthat my brain is wired in this moment\nand there's a lot of great success\nstories about people really overcoming\ndepression so I'm all for empowerment\nbut but I think sometimes especially if\nthe audience is depressed that language\ncan can make people feel worse and you\nwant to talk about the cycle it's like\nokay if these are the things I should do\nto empower myself if people can't do\nthose things it can actually make people\nfeel worse so there are absolutely\nthings that we should do to destigmatize\nand Empower people but I I also think\nthere are things that we can we should\nreally understand that this is just a\npart of your life right now and I think\na lot of that empowerment actually\nstarts with acceptance\nso it really made me see it from a\ndifferent perspective because I never\nthought of it that way like just\naccepting it for what it is yeah you\nknow you're right about the absolutely\nyeah so it's kind of weird but like\nthere's studies that show that some of\nthese like there's a lot of evolution in\nthe field of psychotherapy right now and\nwe're seeing something called third wave\ntherapies and third wave therapies are\nbasically old types of psychotherapy\nplus like mindfulness or Eastern\nprinciples and we're seeing some of\nthese therapies have more effect for a\nlot of things that we haven't been great\nat treating\nand it's really this acceptance angle\nright so like we live in a society where\nwe want to perfect everything like I'm\nnot going to order something from the\ninternet unless it's got five stars I\nwant to eat at restaurants that have\nfive stars absolutely I want my you know\nmy my Uber driver or Lyft driver to have\nfive stars so we're all about optimizing\nand fixing yeah and sometimes I think we\ngot to take a step back and say like hey\nthis is this may just be something that\nI'm struggling with which sounds kind of\ndepressing right and that I I may not be\nable to fix this but the really\nfascinating thing is that when you sort\nof accept instead of struggle to change\nthings over and over and over again\nsomehow clinically it can help people\nso I I didn't mean to\njust attack your question though so like\ngoing back to that I do think that\nactually conversations like this are\nreally really important at\ndestigmatizing I think that people with\ndepression do really struggle with\nfeelings of disempowerment and\nhopelessness so helping people kind of\nget there is really really important I\nthink one thing that people can do is\nthat depression and anxiety are both\nvery isolating experiences so even\nsharing your experience with other\npeople and then checking in with them\nafterward because we make a lot of\nassumptions that oh people wouldn't want\nto hear this right like because I'm\nburdening them so if we talk about that\nif we kind of think about that if I\ndon't share things with people what I'm\nactually doing is promoting the stigma\nbecause hey we're not going to talk\nabout it so sometimes what we really\nwant to do is share our experience with\nother people and you can just check in\nwith them hey what was that like for you\nit kind of felt like I was trauma\ndumping there or like you know like is\nthat does that weigh on you in a\nnegative way you can just check in with\npeople and the really cool thing that we\ntend to see in our community is that\nwhen people share their experiences what\nthey actually find is that there's a lot\nof connection and that other people will\nsay hey I've really been struggling with\nthat too and that Bond can really help\nEmpower everyone involved and\ndestigmatize things absolutely so\nessentially there's a tremendous\nstrength in vulnerability\nabsolutely right so strength and\nvulnerability and that's a great way to\nput it Michelle because\nbeing vulnerable requires acceptance\nabsolutely so if you're vulnerable along\nthe way you're going to sort of\nautomatically accept except and then\nyou're also going to open yourself up to\nconnection which can be so helpful for\npeople struggling with mood disorders or\nanxiety disorders yeah a support system\nis essential like you could never do\nanything alone in this life right so for\neverything you just you need a support\nsystem that foundation and if you don't\nhave it you can find it yeah so I I love\nthat attitude Michelle I think the\nreally scary thing is that we're quickly\nentering a world where you can do\neverything on your own it's bad for your\nhealth for sure so I think yours is the\nright way to do it but we live in a\nworld today where I can get groceries\ndelivered to my house food delivered to\nmy house I can find plumbers to come\nonline I can work online I can play\ngames online I can have an online\ncommunity so we can human beings are the\nmost independent and isolation prone\nthat we've ever been\nwell no that's absolutely true and I\nthink that it can sometimes make things\nworse like it makes things more\naccessible it makes things easier but\nthen it's like okay I feel alone yeah\nyeah well said\nhey we pay a price for that you always\ndo right always a trade-off so how can\nwe effectively support someone we know\nwho's suffering from depression and\nanxiety\nso that's such a great question so I\nthink oftentimes It's tricky because\nwhen someone is struggling we want to\ntry to help them in a meaningful way and\nso what a lot of friends or Partners or\nparents or even children will do is try\nto be someone's therapist you recognize\nthat this person needs help and\noftentimes they'll lean on you in some\nway and and oftentimes it's more than\nsomeone can handle so we really struggle\nabout how can I help my friend like feel\nless suicidal or how can I help my\nfriend who's so depressed and like has\ntrouble sleeping is so anxious all the\ntime and it's great to be a friend but I\nthink one of the most important things\nthat you can do is help connect that\nperson to some form of mental health\ntreatment\nand oftentimes oftentimes what happens\nis that we feel like we're kind of\npassing them off right like we oh hey\nI'm not going to handle that like you go\ngo talk to a professional it's like\nthat's kind of how it can feel to us as\nfriends we can feel guilty for doing\nthat but I think even sort of having\nsome really good language around hey I\ncan see that you're really struggling I\nwant to be your friend and I want to be\nhere for you and at the same time I\nreally think that maybe you should get\nevaluated by a professional and\nsometimes that can be something as\nsimple as like reviewing profiles with\nthem like say like hey you want to call\nthis person can we call them together\nlike what do you think about making an\nappointment because especially with\npeople with anxiety and depression like\nthey're gonna their mind is gonna find\nexcuses for them not to call or not to\nmake an appointment so sometimes that's\none of the most important things that\nyou can do yeah and there's a helpful\nway of giving like a recommendation as a\nfriend like what you said guiding them\nlike showing them I'm not passing you\noff I care about you let's look for you\nknow a therapist together let me you\nknow maybe I they have a therapist it's\nlike you know here's their number right\nso yeah you're actually helping them\nbecause they need if they're struggling\nwith depression and anxiety they need to\nsee a mental health professional\nabsolutely and I think I I liked what\nyou said there because I think sometimes\nthe one of the best things that we can\ndo for someone is to acknowledge that we\ncan't help them in the way that they\ndeserve and we're going to try to help\nthem find the help that they deserve\nthat's perfect that's a perfect way of\nputting it because we all deserve help\nabsolutely yeah and so what are some\ncoping strategies that you recommend for\nthose struggling with depression and\nanxiety\nuh it's a it's a great question so I'm\nlaughing a lot because I think that\noftentimes people who are struggling\nwith depression and anxiety are actually\nlike experts at coping right they're\nmaxed out on their coping skills\nand and so one of the things that\nhonestly my experience with a clinician\nis like\nI get that you're coping\nand like yeah let's do mindfulness so\nthat you can cope more but honestly it\nmakes me super sad that like people have\nto coat cope so much right like and and\nso it's kind of weird but like I almost\nwant to encourage people to get help\nbecause\neveryone wants to optimize coping\nstrategies and it's a good thing to do\nwe know that there's good scientific\nevidence behind them but also like\nsometimes people will avoid going into\ntreatment because they're like okay if I\nlike learn one more coping skill then\nI'll be able to cope I'll be able to\ncope I'll be able to cope and when what\nI really want to tell the people who are\nlistening to this is that we're going to\ntalk about coping strategies in a second\nbecause I guess my favorite thing to do\nis not answer Michelle's questions\nright I'm just kidding\num and and so I I think one thing to\nunderstand is that when you get like\nreally solid in terms of treatment or\nhealth with these things you no longer\nneed to cope and that's really what the\ntarget should be coping is a temporary\nmechanism that should be used\ntemporarily now what are some healthy\ncoping skills I think oftentimes\nwe like talk about the standard stuff\nlike meditation is actually really\nreally good we can also do other kinds\nof things like think about the things\nthat you do that help you feel better\nbut also don't set you up\nfor getting screwed later so there are\nunhealthy coping mechanisms things like\nyou know video games pornography\num alcohol substances of abuse all that\nkind of stuff\nand I think social like reaching out to\npeople socially\nleaning on people like for social\nsupport there's overwhelming evidence\nthat animals can be incredibly helpful\nfor our mental health I've worked with\nso many patients who what literally\nkeeps them alive they're thinking about\nsuicide but like who would take care of\ntheir dog or cat and that's actually a\nreally strong Foundation to build on so\nI don't know depending on where you are\nin life but like getting a pet is\nactually not a bad idea\num or animals right absolutely so the\nfirst psychiatric inpatient unit I\nworked on it was amazing they had a\nminiature horse that would come onto the\nunit and like horrible yeah it was great\nand like I showed up at work one day and\nthere's like a horse in the hallway\nwhich is really weird oh my God I was\nwondering like wait hold on a second or\nhallucinations contagious like there's\nlike there's a horse in the hallway\nright um and so I think animals are\nreally great friends are really great\nmeditation is great oftentimes uh\njournaling and stuff is really fantastic\nbut but people don't really know how to\njournal so like we made a whole video\nYouTube video about like you know how to\njournal effectively\num I think all those things are\nfantastic exercise has been shown to\nhave excellent excellent improvements uh\nwith things like depression and anxiety\nas as well as like things like\nanti-inflammatory diets serotonergic\ndiet so like remember that your brain\nand even the neurotransmitters that you\nproduce\nare tied to what you eat in your gut\nbacteria so we know for example that\npeople with depression and anxiety have\nlow levels of two bacteria in their gut\nand those are the bacteria that actually\nproduce\nserotonin precursors so there's almost\nthis this built-in digestion deficiency\nof some neurotransmitters like serotonin\nand it's not a coping skill but like\nDiet exercise meditation all that stuff\nis great cooking\noh cooking is brilliant yeah\nand you're nourishing yourself and\ntaking care of yourself self-care right\nthe power of self-care absolutely yeah\ncan you say a little bit more about\ncooking\ncooking you know just like\nI guess rewarding yourself and maybe\nbeing creative with it because it kind\nof takes your mind off of things\num so like maybe making cookies and and\nthings like that because it takes your\nmind off of making something yummy and\nthen afterwards you eating you just feel\ngood I mean maybe healthy foods as well\nnot just like cookies and snacks but\nlike maybe I don't know no I'd stop with\nthe cookies so like the cookies right I\nlove that so like like I think Michelle\nyou you demonstrated a lot of really\ngreat stuff there one is that take your\nmind off things but not in a way that\nwill hurt you tomorrow that's the\nbiggest problem is people with\ndepression and anxiety will oftentimes\nuse coping skills that actually dig them\ndeeper into the hole like a crutch the\nother thing that I find is that when I'm\nworking with patients who have like you\nknow\nmood disorders and anxiety disorders\nthat are kind of out of control like I\nthink treat yourself is good like don't\nactually make something like super\nhealthy like if you want to bake cookies\nto right yourself just bake cookies and\nlike eat cookies yeah and I I have I\ndon't think and maybe someone's gonna\nprove me wrong but I've never had a\npatient who has baked their own sweets\nand eaten them to access the way that\npeople will like destroy a bag of Oreos\nyou know right like when you buy like\ncookies from the store there's like 800\nof them and you just like kind of keep\neating them and they're filled with like\ndifferent kinds of chemicals that will\nlike induce cravings and stuff like that\nbut when you like bake sweets at home I\nthink by definition by definition\nthey're way healthier and the other\nreally cool thing there is that if you\nhave a dopaminergic surge from eating a\ncookie after cooking that will reinforce\nthe behavior of cooking so if you cook\nand make something healthy that isn't as\ntasty there's actually less behavioral\nreinforcement so I would actually I\nthink you have given me the best coping\nskill that I've ever heard of for people\nwho are depressed which is like baked\ncookies\nbecause there's a sense of\naccomplishment after you do it like I\ndid that and I got up out of bed and I\nmade my own cookies and their bomb yeah\nthat answer is actually way better than\nanything I said so I love it\nthank you and so that brings me to the\naudience segment of our interview we\nwill be answering viewer questions I'm\nextremely excited we have a lot of\npeople in here today Dr K cool let's do\nit let's do it so\nlet's begin\nso\nsorry about that just going through it\nthere's a lot of comments like I love\nhealthy gamer\nit's my favorite channel so someone just\nasked Adrian asked what's the most\neffective way to cope during an anxiety\nattack\nwe just talked about coping strategies\nbut it's a specific question yeah so one\nthing to understand about anxiety\nattacks so I'm going to refer this to\nlike a panic attack which is actually\nlike clinically something that's a\nlittle bit different but\none thing to understand about panic\nattacks is that we oftentimes think\nabout\nmajor depressive disorder mood disorders\nanxiety disorders panic disorders as\nmental illnesses\none of the reasons that I think that\nespecially like these illnesses are\ngetting worse worldwide is because we're\ntrying to treat them with one hand tied\nbehind our back\nwe do not acknowledge the physiologic\ncontribution to things like panic\nattacks so it's really confusing for a\nlot of people as they think of it as a\nmental problem but really if you look at\npanic attacks there are are survival\nphysiology that goes haywire and is\ninappropriately activated\nso in an acute panic attack there are a\ncouple of things that you can use to\nsort of try to get your physiology back\nunder control\nso first we've got to understand that a\npanic attack is an over activation of\nour sympathetic nervous system which is\nour like survival mechanisms so our body\nis going to be filled with adrenaline\nit's going to be filled with cortisol\nour heart rate is going to be through\nthe roof our blood pressure is going to\nbe super high our respiratory rate is\ngoing to be very high we're going to be\nbreathing very very rapidly\nso one thing that we know is that\nrespiration or breathing\nis a two-way street if you feel a\ncertain way it will change your\nbreathing so if I breathe like this\nthat's like an angry pattern of\nbreathing and if I keep breathing like\nthat there are actually studies that\nshow that people were sort of like\nexperimenting with this stuff and\nresearchers would Breathe that way and\nthen they would start to feel angry even\nif they weren't upset about anything\nso your breathing can control your\nemotions so that's why we really\nrecommend slow deep breaths and actually\nexhalation is more important than\ninhalation so you really want to extend\nout that exhalation as much as possible\num that's one thing that you can do and\nthen there are some also like uh DBT\nkind of coping techniques that the DVT\nis dialectical behavioral therapy one of\nmy favorites is something called ice\ndiving so I'll use this with patients\nthat really struggle and what you can\nreally do is take some ice and you can\nlike dump it into a sink with cold water\nor even grab a bucket and dump some ice\nin there and dunk your face in the ice\nthis will trigger a mammalian diving\nreflex which causes your heart rate and\nyour blood pressure and your sympathetic\nnervous system to kind of calm down\nthere are also other kinds of like\nmindfulness techniques you can do\nthere's always things like medication\nbut if we're talking about like you know\nnon-pharmacologic means like these are\ntwo things that are really important\nabsolutely and so can we talk about\nunusual manifestations of depression and\nanxiety absolutely so I I'm glad you\nasked that question Michelle because\nlike I think a lot of times the reason\nthat people don't get help is that they\ndon't realize that they could have some\nkind of mood disorder so this is\nespecially true in men so men have\nsomething called normative male\nalexithymia which I know is a mouthful\nbut alexithymia is like color blindness\nfor our emotions so as men we're not\ntaught to understand or articulate what\nwe feel so oftentimes when I'm working\nwith men who struggle with depression or\nanxiety especially depression what they\ndescribe feeling is an overwhelming\nsense of pressure\nso they don't feel sad we think about\ndepression as sadness but oftentimes\nit's not it doesn't we don't\nsubjectively experience it as sadness\nwhat we feel like is we're under so much\npressure and we're on the verge of\nbreaking and even though we're trying\nreally really hard we don't think that\nwe're gonna make it so if you really\ntalk to that person what they'll\nexperience is some degree of\nhopelessness but that hopelessness looks\ndifferent it looks like an overwhelming\nsense of pressure that I won't be able\nto fix\nanother really common\num sort of feature of anxiety for\nexample is being really really\nuncomfortable with uncertainty so people\nwith anxiety disorders are kind of like\nworriers and they really can't handle\nuncertainty and what tends to happen is\nanytime there's something that's\nuncertain sometimes they'll like get\nlike hyper fixated on it and they'll be\nlike they'll even like reach out to\nother people for reassurance or like hey\nare you sure you're going to show up\nhave you left yet when are you going to\nbe here are you home like where are you\nso they'll kind of like Badger other\npeople but they they really are not the\nonly way they feel secure is when things\nare certain and if that's really\ninterfering with your relationships if\nit's making it very hard for you to kind\nof do stuff like an overwhelming\ndiscomfort with uncertainty is sometimes\nan anxiety disorder and is that anxiety\nrooted in like a sense of loss of\ncontrol\nuh absolutely so like that's a great\nquestion so let's like understand this\nso sometimes what happens in people with\nanxiety disorders\nis that I feel out of control so like\nI'm afraid or I'm anxious so then what\ndo I do to fix it\nwhat I will do is oftentimes try to\ncontrol my circumstances if I have an\nanxiety disorder and I'm like my my\npartner is out like let's say like my\nwife is like out for like a girls night\nout and if I've got an uncontrolled\nanxiety disorder I'm texting her\nconstantly in the way that I manage my\nanxiety is through her reassurance\nand so what I try to do is I try to\nshape the situation around me I try to\ncontrol the situation so I no longer\nfeel anxious this is really really\ndevastating for children who have\nparents with untreated anxiety so\noftentimes parents who are control\nfreaks don't go over to your friend's\nhouse no slumber parties no going\nswimming you could drown you can't do\nthis you could this could happen this\ncould happen this could happen and so\nwhat they end up doing is control their\ncircumstances to make their feelings go\naway\nthat what that actually does though is\nshapes the way that you live your life\nyou can't live freely because now you're\nnot going to slumber parties or your\nparents isn't letting you go to slumber\nparties they're not letting you play\nwith your friends and if you have that\nanxiety you're closing lots of doors in\nyour life yeah and so that's why what's\nreally tricky is what we find with\nanxiety disorders is\npeople will pay they'll treat their\nanxiety by shutting doors in their life\ndown\nright so I'm gonna stop doing stuff so I\ncan help myself feel better I won't\nleave the house because who knows what's\ngoing to happen out there I'm going to\nstay in these four walls\nand so what we really actually want to\nteach these people to do is surrender\nthat control and start to be okay with\nlike yeah things could go wrong and you\nwill survive and you'll actually be fine\nand then once you do that it's very\nliberating and you start kind of like\nliving life it's like not letting the\nfear control you absolutely yeah and\nthat's perfect that you start talking\nabout parents because someone just asked\nbumblebee gamer asked how can toxic\nparents create anxiety that manifests in\nyou great question so there's tons of\nreally fascinating studies on parents\nand children with anxiety so the first\nthing that's really fascinating is that\nif you have a parent who has anxiety the\nlikelihood that the child has anxiety is\nway higher now some of those factors are\ngenetic but a lot of it is like we\ninternalize\nthe views that our parents have right we\ninherit their political views we inherit\ntheir religious views we inherit their\ncultural views and we also inherit their\nviews of danger of the world so for an\nanxious parent The World Is A Dangerous\nPlace\nand this is where like we can kind of\ninherit that\nso we can a child who grows up in an\nanxious household will\num believe that the world is kind of a\ndangerous place now I just realized that\nthe question was actually a little bit\ndifferent which is how can toxic parents\ncreate anxiety and this is actually a\nreally really fascinating topic so\nchildren who grow up in abusive\nhouseholds\nare very very anxious and why is that\nlet's understand this is a great\nquestion so if I grow up in a safe\nhousehold\nthe world becomes a safe place so\nremember that when I'm a child I'm\nlearning the basics of life I'm learning\nlearning how strong gravity is\nI'm learning what amount of food I can\neat before I throw up I'm learning like\nwhat it feels like to need to use the\nrestroom so the basic Foundation is\nbeing laid down\nnow let's say I grew up with an\nalcoholic parent what that means is on\none day the parent is fine because\nthey're sober the next day they're\nthey're drunk and they're pissed so what\nthat sort of means is that home becomes\nan unsafe place every time I go home I\ndon't know which parent I'm getting so\nthere's no security there's no safety\nand so parents are the people that are\nsupposed to provide us with like a safe\nspace from which we can venture out and\nexplore the world and if we've got a\nhome base that's safe then I can afford\nto like go and explore but when I have\ntoxic parents\nI learned that home is not a safe place\nand there's no space of stability if\nthere's no space of stability the world\nbecomes a dangerous place if the world\nbecomes a dangerous place I can't go out\nand do things so one of the most\nterrifying results of a toxic parent\nis a child who has to be perfect they\nare unable to do trial and error so\npeople will say like hey bro just go out\nthere and just try man or just try a\ngirl like just give it a shot like\nwhat's the Worst That Could Happen yeah\npeople who say that grew up in good\nhouseholds which is why they can afford\nto fail so the weirdest thing they feel\nsafe right which is yes and afford to\nfail like it's no big deal what people\nunderstand is that up to even 50 percent\nof the population grew up in a household\nwhere trial and error was like not a\ngood thing you can't try and fail\nbecause if I open my mouth and like my\nparents are drunk I'm gonna get smacked\nright and so that's what's really\ncrippling is that what we tend to see is\nit manifests in all these weird ways\nlike being perfectionistic not being\nable to try things needing everything to\nbe perfect before you even start those\nare actually really common anxiety\nmanifestations which I think are really\nmore related to trauma mm-hmm absolutely\nand you just mentioned perfectionism and\nthere's a question about that Mr Happy\nasked how to deal with over\nperfectionism that makes me feel\noverwhelmed and I get nothing done how\ndo I make tasks easier for myself rather\nthan harder or impossible to achieve\nyeah so I it's a great it's a great\ngreat question so\nthere's I'm going to start by kind of\nlike leaning into Eastern principles\nwow so there's a there's a really\ninteresting concept called karma far\nwhich means the fruit of our actions\nso in kind of like if you look at yoga\nand meditation what they sort of say is\nthat as a human being\nyou are not entitled to the fruits of\nyour actions\nthat all you're entitled to as a human\nbeing are the actions themselves and\noftentimes if we sort of think about\nsomeone who's perfectionistic they're\nshooting for a particular outcome I need\nan a I need a hundred but the thing is\nlike if we stop and think about it I\ndon't actually control whether I get an\nA or not right the professor could\ndislike me I may have not studied\nsomething\num you know I may have forgotten\nsomething like there may be a chapter\nwhere I wrote something down wrong so\nwhether I get an A or not is not\nactually in my control what's in my\ncontrol is whether I study or not\nso if you really want to overcome\nperfectionism there are a couple things\nyou have to do the first is to focus on\nyour actions instead of the outcomes so\nwhether you studied enough is not based\non whether you're going to get an A or\nnot it's really stop and think about\nokay like what am I here to learn and\nhow much time am I willing to devote and\nI'm going to devote that and that's\ngoing to be like enough right because\nstudying\n50 hours\nmaybe unreasonable but maybe I can do\nlike 20 hours this week so it's to\nreally focus on the action instead of\nthe outcome and this is something that\nlike it's kind of a brutal story but\nlike you learn this the hard way in med\nschool whereas like you know we have a\nlot of great medicine like we can\nliterally we can remove a heart from\nsomeone's body and keep them alive we\ncan stick a whole different heart into\nyour body we can replace your lungs we\ncan replace your kidneys we can replace\nall kinds of stuff your liver we can\nbasically we're going to replace limbs\nwe can replace hips and knees we can\nlike literally take a piece out of you\nand stick someone else's piece in there\nand make that work and you can live a\nnormal life doctors are magicians yeah\nand we have we do not control life or\ndeath that is something you learn the\nhard way in medicine\nbecause patients die right like when\nthey come to the hospital like that's\nsometimes what happens so one of the\nbrutal lessons that you learn is that as\na doctor how do I know I do a good job\nlike how can I live with myself and what\nyou focus on is did I do the best job\nthat I could\nshould I have studied more should I have\nlike you know run more tests should I\nhave consulted with other people and so\nall you can do as a doctor is like what\nyou can do and the rest of it like you\ncan't control is based on God or the\nuniverse or RNG or like whatever you\nwant to call it\nand so in that same way what I encourage\npeople who are who are perfectionistic\nto do is to really think about okay what\ncan I actually control here what I can\ncontrol is my actions and let me focus\non the action is the last thing that\nyou'll remember for people who are\nperfectionistic is they get so caught up\non the outcome that they can never get\nstarted\nand so what we really want to do is\nfocus on that action itself and if you\ntake the right actions over time you\nwill generally speaking get the result\nthat you want\nabsolutely I agree with that it's just\nlike\nknowing that you did your best and if\nyou didn't do your best it's rectifying\nthat but knowing that you can't control\neverything you can only control your\nactions that's it and if you did the\nbest you can then you should be proud of\nthat absolutely and so that takes me to\nthe next question Oakley asked I might\nbe wondering if trauma can increase prob\nthe probability of having anxiety 100\n110 absolutely even I know that there's\ntons of research around that I think the\nreally tricky thing is that sometimes I\nwould say that trauma is sort of like\nthe great chameleon of mental illness\nbecause it can look like all kinds of\nthings there are patients that I've had\nwhere like you know they come in with\nlike a diagnosis of an anxiety disorder\nthey've had anxiety for 10 years it\nhasn't really gotten better and when we\nreally do like trauma-informed\nPsychotherapy is like when we really\nstart to see progress\num and Trauma can also manifest as\nthings like ADHD because it impairs your\nconcentration so people have difficulty\nlike paying attention the reason they\nhave difficulty paying attention is\nbecause they're actually kind of like\ndissociating which is more of a trauma\nresponse and so when you dissociate you\nkind of mentally check out you forget\nthings and so trauma is really tricky\nbecause it can look like ADHD it can\nlook like chronic depression it can look\nlike anxiety\nmm-hmm absolutely and then um City asked\nI have a problem of recreating past\nscenarios in my mind is this a sign of\ndepression or anxiety\nyeah so I also see that I can't accept\nthe situation as it is and regret my\ndecision\ncurrent and then how to overcome yes\nyeah so that's a great question so let's\nunderstand something like fundamental\nabout depression and anxiety\nso this is going to sound kind of like\nweird it's a little bit of a hyperbole\nbut it's kind of true\nso if you are in the present it is very\ndifficult or I would even arguably even\nsay impossible to have\nto be depressed or anxious if you were\nfully in the present and let's like\nunderstand what I mean by that okay so\nif we think about depression depression\nis characterized by regret\nand if I'm filled with regret my mind is\nnot in the present it's in the past\nif I think about anxiety what is anxiety\nanxiety is the mind in the future I'm\nworrying about something that hasn't\nhappened yet but in both cases I'm\nliterally not in the present now some\npeople may say I have anxiety about past\nevents but if you really tunnel down\ninto that\nwhat you're going to find is that\nit's actually like something bad\nhappened and you're afraid of what's\ngoing to happen next but you still sort\nof you're still kind of thinking about\nthe past or the future like in either\ncase you're like in the past or the\nfuture\nso if you have trouble chewing over past\nscenarios\nwhat that is is actually a circuit of\nyour brain that's kind of gotten a\nlittle bit Haywire so we have the\ncircuit in our brain that does something\ncalled counter factual thinking and this\nis a great circuit in the brain so\nanytime we make a mistake our brain has\nthe ability to go back in time and think\nabout\nwhat we could have done differently so\ndon't think about the facts as they\nhappened but go against the facts and\nhypothesize how to live our life\ndifferently that's good that's like how\nwe learn how to solve problems right so\nwe don't make the same mistake twice\nwhat could I have done differently what\ntends to happen in depression is that\nthat part of our brain gets out of\ncontrol and we get kind of stuck in the\npast and in regret and then we get so\ncaught up in like thinking about how to\nchange it or fix it that we are no we\nstop living in the present and so we get\nyou know one example is like if I got\nupset about The One That Got Away let's\nsay I had a crush in high school yeah\nand she got away right and then if I'm\nliving in the past I'm not living my\nlife in the present I don't realize that\nthere are actually other people that I\ncould be meeting other relationships I\ncould be forming and this is also why we\nsort of understand that mindfulness\nis both an evidence-based treatment for\ndepression and anxiety and how is that\nit's because it fixes this time problem\nwhat it really does is help us come to\nthe present and so if you're really like\nstuck in the past or if you're stuck\nlike with regret recognize that as long\nas your mind is living in the past\nyou're gonna that's what's gonna happen\nso practice spending time in the present\nand literally bring your mind to the\npresent you can drink water mindfully\nyou can bake right and you can really\nlike eat that cookie and don't worry\nabout what it's going to do for you\ntomorrow and like swimsuit season is\ncoming up that's anxieties for the\nfuture and really just enjoy the present\nas much as you can\nabsolutely I definitely agree with that\nand it's a matter of self-reflection\nright like it takes that emotional\nintelligence and self-reflection to just\nbe like Mindful and not kind of go\noverboard with the past scenarios right\nyeah absolutely it's hard though because\nI think that what happens is the mind\ngets out of control right which is why\nwe kind of get stuck but you're right\nthat self-reflection is a really good\nway to digest emotions absolutely and\nthen gunblazer asks can anxiety\ndisorders create or bring about more\ndisorders or mental illnesses\nyeah so generally speaking\nthe answer is yes but those tend to be\npretty specific so it's not like anxiety\nwill lead to all kinds of different\nstuff but what we do know is that if\nyou're if you get diagnosed with an\nanxiety disorder\nearly on in life\nthat that will impair your developing\nyears and oftentimes what we see is\nmissed milestones\nso you don't form friends you may not\nstart engaging in romantic relationships\nyour anxiety May prevent you from like\napplying for an internship or something\nlike that and so as you miss those\nMilestones that can sort of grow into\ndepression over time\nthe good news is that oftentimes we\nthink once we miss a milestone that like\nI can't go back in time and I hear this\na lot from people who are like socially\nanxious and didn't date and they kind of\nthink well like now I'm 30 and like I\ndidn't ever go on dates in high school\nand I never had a like a girlfriend or\nboyfriend in college and now it's like\ntoo late for me the good news is that\nyou can basically go back and fix all of\nthose milestones\nI was going to energize I think that\nsometimes people have anxiety about like\ndating and not having experience because\nthey're afraid of telling people\nespecially if they start dating someone\nand they're asked well what were your\npast relationships like that brings\nabout anxiety like well I haven't had\none are they gonna think I'm a loser are\nthey gonna think I'm weird so I think\nthat's kind of what happens as well\nabsolutely right so like so the anxiety\nwill manifest all sorts of ways yeah\nright and and that that's that's the\nreal problem that's why it's so\nparalyzing because if I have no\nrelationship experience and my anxiety\ntells me\nor depression tells me this person will\nreject me because I'm inexperienced and\nthen I never go out with them in the\nfirst place which means I stay stuck in\nno dating experience right it just makes\nit worse\nand so this is where that acceptance\ncomes in right so what people they're\ntrying to do is they're trying to fix\nthe problem they're like I should have\ndated\nyeah like I know it's kind of weird but\nsometimes when I work with people like\nthey find language is very helpful and\nif people ask me you know if you had\nwhat were your past relationships like\nyou can say like you know I just I've\nnever actually been in a a full-fledged\nrelationship before and they may be\nsurprised by that and I know this is\nwhere if we're anxious oftentimes what\nwe want to do is like justify or explain\nourselves yeah but what you can really\ndo is just say hey like you know I just\nhaven't I I haven't really found a solid\nrelationship they may if they want to\nask why they can ask why you know like\nyou can and you can even invite them you\ncan say you're welcome to ask questions\nabout that if you're curious I just\nhaven't had a good opportunity to really\ndate\nand if they judge you they're the wrong\nperson right\npresumably yeah like if they're judging\nyou and criticizing you then they're\ndoing you a favor and you need to meet\nsomeone who is accepting yeah and kind\nyou know absolutely absolutely I think\nthe real devastating thing is that if\nthey judge you it makes it so much\nharder to try again right because you\nmustered up all that energy and you went\nout there you put yourself out there\njust like everyone who's like just put\nyourself out there bro and you did that\nand you kind of got punished for it and\nthat's more likely I think one of the\nthe biggest challenges that I see people\nwith both depression and anxiety do is\nthat they don't judge other people\nnegatively enough I know it sounds kind\nof weird yeah in that scenario if you\nstruggle with depression or anxiety you\nthink that you're the loser you never\nstop to think that like why is this\nperson so judgmental like yeah they\ndon't have their problem yeah it's a\nit's a you problem yeah because there's\neven old psychoanalytic literature from\nFreud that when we stop being angry at\nother people\nwe turn that anger Inward and it becomes\ndepression so one of the most\nfascinating treatments for depression is\nto actually direct that anger where it\nrightly belongs which is outside of you\nand towards someone else so it's kind of\nweird but sometimes in Psychotherapy\nsome of the most important breakthroughs\nI've had with patients with depression\nis allowing them to be pissed at people\nin their life who actually let them down\ninstead of the patient blaming\nthemselves which is usually what happens\nyeah\nso like sitting on that feeling\nof like you know what it's not all my\nfault and being kind to yourself and\nforgiving yourself because it isn't all\nyour fault how can you be at fault for\neverything that's gone wrong in your\nlife like that's not possible yeah no I\nmean but some people believe it right\nthey shouldn't but thank you so Moon\nasks does OCD have anything to do with\nanxiety and depression\nI'm gonna go ahead and say not really\nexcept there everything is going to be\nlike yes or no so generally speaking I\ndon't think about OCD as being directly\nrelated to anxiety or depression now the\nsame thing is true probably of OCD as\nlike anxiety and ADHD in the sense that\nif you get diagnosed with OCD and it\ninterferes with your life a lot and goes\nuntreated you may grow into a mood\ndisorder like depression the second\nthing that we do know is that high dose\nserotonergic medication so the same like\nantidepressant anti-anxiety medication\nat high doses can really help people\nwith OCD so there's probably something\nsimilar in the brain going on the\nbiggest thing that I would say connects\nOCD and depression and anxiety in my\nclinical experience there's a lot of\npeople who think they're super anxious\nactually have OCD or people who think\nthey're depressed because they have all\nthese negative thoughts that can\nactually be OCD so OCD is it really has\na a lot of intrusive thoughts so if you\nthink about I'm worried about this all\nthe time like let's say I'm\nworried about getting sick\nfrom everyone and I don't want to touch\nanything and I'm constantly washing my\nhands if you talk to that person how do\nyou feel they feel worried they're\nconcerned with uncertainty but that\nreally has more of an OCD flavor so one\nreason why I think it's really important\nto not just self-diagnose yourself on\nthe Internet is that you can sort of\nlike have OCD and it can really look\nlike depression or anxiety because it's\ncomplex you know that's why you\nshouldn't diagnose yourself absolutely\nit can be both depression anxiety and\nOCD so that's the importance of mental\nhealth treatment absolutely and then M\nwolf asks how do you feel about going no\ncontact with toxic parents after\nachieving Independence\nI'm gonna I'm gonna answer this in a\nvery frustrating way possible which is\nnot to really answer the question so and\nwell if my answer to you my friend is it\ndoesn't matter how I feel the question\nis how do you feel\nright so so I I think this is a\nsituation where I think it's okay to set\nboundaries with toxic parents and\noftentimes in parent-child relationships\nwhen we set boundaries we feel guilty\nand this is where what I kind of\nrecommend to people who are struggling\nwith this is that no contact for Now\ndoes not necessarily mean no contact\nforever and the basic problem with toxic\nparents is that they do not allow you to\nheal right so this what I kind of think\nabout is let's say I've got a boat\nthat's got holes in it and I'm taking on\nwater\nand it's totally fine to get out of the\nocean and go to a port and get yourself\npatched up before you go back in and\nthat's kind of the approach that I tell\npeople to take is like if if the\ntoxicity is too much for you to handle\nand they've done some amount of damage\ndealing with toxic parents requires you\nto be stable and so sometimes a period\nof no contact or no contact for the rest\nof your life but let's start with now\nright like we don't have to think about\nthe future so it's okay to set a no\ncontact and tell your parents hey like I\nneed like a year to really focus on\nmyself and like get myself stable I'm\nnot saying it's forever I acknowledge\nthat this is probably hurtful to you but\nI really need this for my health\nand I'm happy to revisit in a year\nand part of the problem is that y'all\ndon't respect my boundaries and so if\nyou guys can't respect this decision\nthen like I'm gonna need to extend it\nlonger\nabsolutely it's not like black and white\nit's like you can just take a pause yeah\nabsolutely and I think the reason that\npeople go so much into black and white\nis because if you've got toxic invasive\nparents any Shades of Gray they will\nlike invade so that's why people like\ntry to go no contact what I'd say is Go\nno contact but no contact doesn't have\nto be forever\nabsolutely and then T3 Dragon asks I'm\ndealing with nerve damage for for 15\nyears I've researched my issues with\nfamily who are doctors other doctors\nI've seen ignore what I know when I\ncorrect them on my issues the depression\nworsens when doctors belittle what I\nknow how do I deal with this\nso that's super tricky I mean I think\nthat unfortunately a lot of patients\nhave the experience that\ndoctors don't listen to them\num I think that\nyou know this is where you've got to be\nsuper careful about two things\nthe first is that oftentimes doctors are\narrogant and so honestly the right\nanswer is to keep looking for doctors\nuntil you find someone who's able to\nlisten to you\nthe second problem is that sometimes\nwe have our own cognitive bias that\nshapes the way that we hear what doctors\nare saying\nright so it and so we have to be a\nlittle bit careful about\nyou know if doctors are belittling your\nissues like that's that could absolutely\nbe true but is there any Gray Zone there\nwhere they're sort of taking you\nseriously and like not kind of like\nbelittling at least a piece of it and\nthen I think the third thing that you\ncan really do is talk to your doctors\nabout the way that you feel this is the\nthe most important thing and and you can\nsay like you know hey I feel like you're\nnot taking my complaint seriously\num because oftentimes it's kind of\ntricky but like if we have rare cases\nthat doctors don't know how to treat we\ncan almost trigger a defensive reaction\nwithin the doctor yeah where they're\nlike yeah like if if I can't find\nanything like I don't know what's wrong\nwith you or you know so that can be kind\nof tricky but I'd say definitely like\ntalk to your doctors about the way that\nyou feel and if you feel like misheard\nor belittled\nand and hopefully that'll help\nand I mean I feel like it would be\ndeeply upsetting for someone because it\nfeels terrible to be invalidated by this\nprofessional you know because you you\nlook up to them and and if the\nprofessional is invalidating you you\nfeel like okay well then yeah you know\nIt's upsetting yeah the last thing I\nwould say is that I've kind of learned\nthe hard way that if a patient tells me\nsomething that I do not think is true\nit is not good for me or the patient to\nnot believe them\nand and this is where because like if we\nreally think about we know a lot in\nmedicine but I would bet money that if I\nwent a thousand years in the future we\nwould know\n10 times as much as we know today we're\nactually at our infancy of competence as\ndoctors\nand so if there's a patient who you know\nis telling you hey something is like off\nbecause if we think about some of these\nnew diagnoses like IBS pots fibromyalgia\nchronic fatigue syndrome complex\nregional pain syndrome they're all of\nthese new diagnoses that for many many\nyears doctors thought were like all in a\npatient's head but we now know that all\nof this stuff has like some real\nphysiology to it and and so I I strongly\nencourage you to look for a doctor who\nwill take your concern seriously it\ndoesn't mean that they can actually fix\nit because we may not have all the\nanswers but there's a big difference\nbetween I don't know how to help you and\nwhat you have is not real yeah someone\nwho's willing to discuss try to\nunderstand and they're empathetic I\nthink that's key in any profession you\nneed a professional to be empathetic\nyeah and and I I think that like like I\nsaid I've learned kind of the hard way\nthat you know if a patient says hey\nthere's something wrong with me like I\ntrust them and I may not have a medical\nexplanation but there are two reasons\nfor that one is that our instruments\naren't perfect so we may develop some\nnew test or understand some new\nbiomarker or be able to do some kind of\nGene testing that will help us discover\nwhat is wrong with you we just can't do\nthat right now but that doesn't mean\nthat what you have isn't real\nabsolutely and then esmb asks how can we\nunderstand and overcome generational\ntrauma\num that's a great question I think\nthat's a question that it's kind of hard\nto to answer in brief\num\nand what I would kind of say is let me\nthink about that one for a second\nso I think the biggest thing about\ngenerational trauma is that\nwe get we inherit\na view of the world or a way of\nconnecting with the world that is shaped\nby our trauma so we live in a reality\nthat is a little bit different from\nhopefully what a healthy reality is\nand so I think that generational trauma\nlike is really something where like a\ngood psychotherapist is like the best\nway to do it I think it can sometimes be\nvery helpful to talk to the generations\nabove you and try to understand what\ntheir experience of life was like so one\nexample is like you know I'll have\npatients who have had parents who are\nreally really harsh and we're like the\nonly things you can study is like you\nhave to be a stem major like science\ntechnology engineering mathematics like\nmedicine whatever no Arts no creativity\nno music and that can be really hurtful\nfor people but I think one thing that's\nreally useful is to talk to your parents\na little bit about where does this view\ncome from and what was your upbringing\nlike or even talk to your parents and\nwhat was their upbringing like that can\nhelp you gain some context and\nunderstanding but honestly if the\ngenerational trauma is like super bad\nlike Psychotherapy is the way to go like\nyour parents may not be able to help you\nwith that because they live with that\ntrauma and they carry it too and maybe\nlike a mental health therapist can be\nlike a media but mediator between the\ntwo right like if you go to therapy yeah\nit can be but I think that should be\ndriven by the patient yeah I've heard\nand seen too many cases of parents I\nmean sorry therapists trying to\nbe matchmakers between kids and their\nparents when there's like a lot of\ntoxicity there so I think you've got to\nbe super careful about pushing for that\nas a therapist so if the patient wants\nit then by all means I'm happy to help\nbut that should be really dictated by\nthem and then our last audience question\nBible tool can school worsen depression\nand anxiety 100 110 120 yes right so so\nI think any stressor can worsen\ndepression and anxiety and I think the\nother really challenging thing is that\nwe assume that school like everyone does\nschool so I should be able to handle it\nbut the people's experiences in school\nare like really really different right\nthere's some people who are like captain\nof the football team and like prom King\nand then there are kids like myself who\nare like bullied every day or a year\nyounger than all my colleagues so like I\nsuck at sports\nand any other people who hit puberty\nlater and people who hit puberty earlier\nand so it takes some time to really\nfigure out like where you are in life\nespecially in school but we don't really\ntreat ourselves that way what we do in\nschool is We compare all the time I\nshould be this I should be this I should\nbe this so we think about school as like\na uniform intervention but it's actually\nlike a completely different world it's\ncompletely alien depending on what your\nschool experience is like and one can\nabsolutely worsen depression and anxiety\nand I think those like labels are like\nharmful like you're a jock you're a\ncheerleader I was called a nerd like all\nthe time every day and those labels it\ncan be like a little it's obviously\nupsetting yeah because you know I think\nbeing a nerd is a good thing now but at\nthe time right yeah absolutely so thank\nyou for the audience questions everyone\nand then I have\num a question about men's Mental Health\nAwareness Month actually this month is\nmeant to Health Awareness Month excuse\nme\num what do you think is the importance\nof men mental health in terms of just\nhaving them seek treatment and speaking\nup about their issues\nyeah so that's a great question so I\nthink a lot of men we are\ntaught and conditioned to tolerate pain\nyep so what a lot of men will do so one\nof the theories why men\ncommit suicide at about four times as\noften as women is it was one of the\ninteresting theories is that we are\ntaught to tolerate so much pain that at\nsome point like the pain like we never\nBend we just break so men will like be\ndepressed depressed depressed and they\nwon't seek treatment they won't kind of\nget better until they reach their\nbreaking point and then they just kind\nof crack so I think the one message that\nI think it's really important to\nunderstand is that yeah it's kind of\nmanly to be tough right but the real\nquestion that I would ask the men in the\naudience is whether you're supposed to\nbe tough or not supposed to be tougher\nwhether you're manly or not manly the\nreal question is do you want to continue\nliving this way\nso if you're struggling if you're\nsuffering a lot of pain I'm not saying\nit's strength or weakness or forget\nabout all that crap really ask yourself\nwhat kind of Life do you want\nand also as men we are conditioned that\nwhat we want is not as important as the\nvalue we provide so as men we are\nproviders we are protectors and so like\nlike I've worked with so many depressed\nand suicidal men who are just bearing\nthe burden of like other people's lives\nand we don't really think about what we\nwant in our life right so as a man like\nI'm supposed to sacrifice myself for the\nsake of the betterment of the people\naround me and I think the most difficult\nquestion that we tend to not ask\nourselves is what do I want and if\nyou're tired of living your life under a\nton of pressure or feeling overwhelmed\nor kind of thinking like this this\nactually sucks for me but like I can't\ndo anything about it I would strongly\nencourage you to get help because the\noverwhelming experience I've had working\nwith men patients male patients\nis that you don't have to live a life\nlike this you can actually fulfill the\nresponsibilities that you want it can\nactually be very very healthy to set\ndown responsibilities that people thrust\nupon you that you did not choose to\naccept and that you can live a happy and\nfulfilling life you may just need a\nlittle bit of help getting there but you\nabsolutely deserve it and it's\ndismantling the barriers of toxic\nmasculinity\nabsolutely so I think that like all\nthose features or features of toxic\nmasculinity the tolerance for pain the\nexpectation of sacrifice\ndevaluing your own desires compared to\nthe people around you all features of\ntoxic masculinity and then my last\nquestion for you Dr K how can we\neliminate the stigma around Mental\nHealth\n[Music]\num I don't know if we can eliminate it\nbut what I would say is that the biggest\nproblem with mental health is that it\nhas lived in the shadows so mental\nhealth and mental illness has lived in\nthe shadows for way too long so I I'm\nlike Indian by ethnicity and and even\nculturally like being Indian it's still\nlike really in the shadows where like no\none everyone will hear about heart\nattacks or cancer and people will call\nand visit and support but if anyone has\na mental struggle it's like behind\nclosed doors don't let anyone know and\nso I think like you know light is one of\nthe best disinfectants light is also\nincredibly good for like the human body\nand I think the biggest thing that we\nneed to do is to share our experiences\nand then connect with each other over\nthose experiences because mental health\nthere's even a very strong theoretical\nbelief that mental health is the only\norgan of the body our mind is the only\nmore organ of the body that for its\nHealth requires connection with other\nhuman beings\nit's the only thing that we cannot fix\non our own so our heart kind of takes\ncare of itself immune kind of take\nimmune system takes care of itself the\nmind is the only thing that may require\nother people to be healthy\nabsolutely well a big thank you to Dr k\nfor joining us today it's been a\npleasure and a huge thank you to our\namazing intelligent viewers for being\nhere today until next time guys have a\ngreat day thank you so much Michelle you\ntoo of course\nI'm stepping out is that cool"
