    "transcript": "no matter who we interact with friends\nlovers teachers or bosses we naturally\nwant them to like us\nand if we're not naturally relaxed and\ncharismatic this might be a bit tough\nand anxiety provoking luckily research\nand psychology has provided us with some\ntips and tricks that might increase our\nchances in forming meaningful and\nfulfilling relationships with those\naround us want to try some of them out\nkeep watching to see what they are\nthe pratfall effect\nwhen trying to be liked by others people\noften strive for Perfection we're afraid\nto show any flaws in front of others\nbecause we fear others would think badly\nof us but is that actually true\nwell it turns out not really in 1966\npsychologist Elliot Aronson and his\ncolleagues investigated if making\nmistakes increases liking participants\nlisten to a tape recording of an actor\nwho pretended to be a contestant on a\nquiz in one group of participants the\nactor was presented as highly\nknowledgeable answering almost all the\nquestions correctly later in the\nexperiment half of the tapes recorded\nthe knowledgeable actor spilling his\ncoffee and apologizing researchers\nwondered who will the participants like\nmore clumsy smart person or non-climsy\nsmart person\nthe results showed that a clumsy smart\nperson was perceived as more likable\nThis was later called the Prattville\neffect the tendency for interpersonal\nappeal to change after an individual\nmakes a mistake this may happen because\nif someone sees you as highly competent\nthey may feel inferior in your presence\nmistakes and showing your human makes\npeople feel like you're on the same\nlevel as them and like you more in\nreturn so you don't need to strive for\nPerfection allow yourself to just be as\nyou are\nI feel the same way\nlet's do a little test what do you like\nmore people who share your World Views\nor people who disagree with you on\nalmost everything\naccording to research done by social\npsychologists you probably like the ones\nthat are more similar to you in a\nclassical 1961 study published in the\nJournal of abnormal and Social\nPsychology it was found that having\nsimilar attitudes increased liking\npsychologists believe that it feels\nrewarding when someone agrees with your\nperception of things and this feeling\nreinforces liking in return and the more\nthey agree the more you like them so to\ntake advantage of these results try to\nfind out as much as you can about the\npeople you talk to and focus on the\nthings you have in common do you both\nenjoy listening to Indie pop music do\nyou share the same passion towards\nhating pineapple on pizza or maybe you\nboth find it super important to raise\nawareness about environmental issues\nwhatever it is as soon as you find the\nsimilarities emphasize them encourage\nthem to talk about it more and make sure\nto use the phrase I totally agree when\nconversing with them surely they'll\nenjoy that conversation a lot don't tell\nsharing your attitudes is one thing but\nwhen you think about sharing Secrets\nwhile some people are more private and\nreserved others just love the excitement\nof a secret maybe you share about that\ntime you fell down the stairs in front\nof your crush or that you still secretly\nbinge watch SpongeBob\nyou let them in on a piece of view that\nis not usually seen by others and\naccording to the psychological theory of\nself-disclosure you might benefit from\nopening up\nfor example a 2017 study published in\ncomputers and human behavior suggests\nthat showing vulnerability and being\nopen about your thoughts feelings hopes\nand dreams increases the sense of\nfamiliarity and closeness between you\nand the other person they might feel\nspecial that you chose them for sharing\nthe secret with and it also sends a\nmessage that you trust them so if you\nwant someone to like you don't be afraid\nto show a deeper Part of Yourself\nI'll see you again\nin 1967 psychologists from the\nUniversity of Minnesota conducted an\nexperiment they gave participants\nambiguous information about two women\nthey also told them that they're soon\ngoing to have a personal conversation\nwith one of those women\nlater they asked the participants how\nmuch they liked each of the girls based\non the information they got the results\nshowed that participants showed a\npreference for the woman they were\nsupposed to interact with in the future\nthese findings LED psychologists to\nbelieve that anticipating an interaction\nwith someone increases attraction\nso to make sure people will like you\nthink of some situations where you'll\nmeet again and make sure to let them\nknow maybe you can say I'll see you\ntomorrow or I'll go to that party too we\ncan hang out there\nsince they will expect to see you again\nthey might just like you a bit more\ndo you know some psychological tips that\nhelp you make friends or seem more\nlikable share them in the comments below\nand if you decide to try some of these\ntricks out let us know how it went if\nyou like this video be sure to hit the\nlike button and
