    "transcript": "can you think back to the last time\nsomeone said or did something that upset\nyou so much you were basically\nspeechless\nsomething where your brain says rude\nthis is not just being blunt or saying\nthings in Anger it's those things that\nserve no purpose other than to hurt and\ndemean others and we don't have The\nInfinity Gauntlet to snap them into\nniceness so what should you do well\nwe're on your side and we have some\ncomebacks that can hopefully help with\ndiffusing that mean Spark\nnumber one\nhey you seem a little upset is\neverything okay\nwhat do you do to deal with fire you\ndampen it after the s'mores are done of\ncourse and sometimes meanness is really\nfiery\nthey're flaring up all over the place\nsetting a light anyone who comes close\neveryone is kindling even if you're not\nfiring back and being normal seriously a\nstudy showed that ongoing interactions\nlike negotiations with rude people\nincrease the other party's rudeness\nthereafter so this phrase is like a fire\nblanket it's a dampener that discourages\nthe spread it forces the other person to\ntake a pause and provide Insight showing\nthat you are listening and care not just\ngetting swept up in The Inferno benefit\nfor you knowing the why gives you tools\nand control to make a better decision\nlike fireproofing number two\nlet's start this conversation over\nthis is where the conversation started\noff Ruff then morphed into an angry\nnearly incoherent Battle Zone many times\nit's because emotions grew until both\nsides lost empathy for each other\nall either side can see is you are not\nthinking of my point of view\nIn the Heat of the Moment we forget this\ntruth\nmy feelings are valid and theirs are\nequally valid which means we forget to\nconsider the answer to this question\ndo I know or have I considered their\npoint of view\nso this phrase helps communicate that\nthe entire thing might have started with\na misunderstanding and you're open to a\nnew point of view\nnumber three\nI don't allow people to talk to me like\nthat and this is you respecting yourself\nand the boundaries you have set this is\nyours and yours alone and no one else\nhas the right to change it or stomp on\nit\nsome people will certainly try though\nyou might recognize this in targeted put\ndowns and any comment that paint you as\nless than them\nyou have no obligation to let them\ndictate your validity this phrase is\ntelling them that you know who you are\nand that using your pain to bolster\nthemselves is not their right nor is it\nacceptable if the person is Amplified\nmeanness with no hint of growth you have\nthe right to walk away you don't need\nthat noise\nor let's just take a few minutes to calm\ndown before it gets worse and come back\nto this later\nyou can reword this in several ways but\nyou're essentially saying you've noticed\nthat this is probably not the path you\nwant to take and better discussion was\nhappening before this phrase is like the\nreset button so you can hopefully reload\nat the save point before the\nconversation turned into a fight but\nstill have all the progress you made\nduring the calm part of the conversation\nof course angling towards yourself like\nI am feeling very emotional and I need\nto settle please may work better showing\nthat you're self-aware and care about\nothers not just pressing your point\ntelling an already emotional person you\nneed to calm down usually it does\nexactly the opposite\nand number five\nyou need to reevaluate the way you speak\nto people\nspeaking of careful phrases you may want\nto save this particular one for when the\nmean or rude person is blatantly out of\nline or if they ask you straight up why\ndo people react this way to me we say be\ncareful because saying you need to can\nsound like an order which could flare a\ndefensive response even if you're not\nthe target but they're constantly\nspinning Venom about everyone else this\nphrase even if true may not be received\nwell if they're not ready to hear it on\nthe other hand it can certainly help\nyour understanding of where and why they\nare the way they are\nthey could have a mini epiphany of I\nnever knew I came off that way\nor\nthey could double down proclaiming that\neveryone else is the problem and then\nstart hurling insults at you\nand a rare twist maybe you'd find\nyourself uncovering a situation where\nthe person isn't being mean but being\nbullied and gaslighted by those they've\ncomplained about\nmean people exist but they're not all\nthe same\neach of these phrases gives the person a\nchance to show you what they're made of\nare they oblivious to how they sound or\nis there a deeper story where you're\nonly seeing the tip of the iceberg\nthere are also those who are incapable\nof being courteous because they lack the\ncapacity to care about others and take\nresponsibility for themselves that's not\non you nor is it your responsibility to\naccept poor treatment you who have done\nyour best to give them a chance do have\nthe green light to walk away\nthey don't get to feed on you and when\neveryone else does the same the only\nthing we can do is hope the mean person\ngets a wake-up call\nwhat kind of mean people have you\nencountered how has your experience\nchanged over time if you've tried\nsimilar comebacks what happened please\ncomment and discuss and we know you're\nnot mean enough to leave us without\npushing that like button"
