    "transcript": "[Music]\nthis is a disclaimer that this video is\nfor informative purposes only and is not\nintended to diagnose or treat any\ncondition please reach out to a\nqualified mental health professional if\nyou're struggling\nabuse neglect abandonment violence and\naccidents are a few of many examples\npertaining to trauma trauma comes in\nmany forms and can happen at any stage\ninfluencing the way you think act and\nprocess emotions\nthese traumas can resurface in ways that\nwe don't immediately recognize\nto better understand some of these\nunknown triggers we'll be taking a look\nat seven of them number one Sensations\nseeing and hearing something that\nreminds you of your past can certainly\ntrigger a traumatic response certain\ntextures tastes and even smell can\ntrigger your trauma your sense of smell\nis closely correlated to your memory\nwhich can make you especially sensitive\nto these stimuli according to an article\nby McLean Hospital in 2015 this works in\nthe same way that a scent can make you\nnostalgic of something in the past or\ncan bring you comfort like fresh baked\ncookies your brain responds to\nSensations quickly and can create an\nemotional reaction before you have time\nto process what it is number two being\nwith people that are emotional if you've\nbeen through an abusive or neglectful\nchildhood you may find yourself on edge\nwhen someone shows strong emotions\nwhether it's someone bursting into tears\nor raising their voice you may find\nyourself growing increasingly\nuncomfortable Dr Denise Webb from Psych\nCentral in 2019 states that this is\nrelated to how someone else's emotions\naffected yours when another person is\ngetting emotional you may find yourself\nbubbling with feelings that you weren't\nallowed to have\nthis in turn makes the situation\nuncomfortable and escaping a priority\nnumber three reactions to certain places\nand people trauma is triggered by memory\nbeing in situations that remind you of\nyour trauma can be a difficult\nexperience any resemblance to your\ntrauma is a potential trigger people\nthat remind you of someone who's hurt\nyou or being in a physical location that\nresembles a bad place can bring unwanted\nmemories according to the integrative\nLife Center in 2022 you may not always\nrecognize this talking with specific\npeople may feel off for an unexplained\nreason perhaps they're a reminder of\nsomeone from your past subtle reminders\nlike the colors people wear or if their\nstature is similar to an abuser May\ntrigger a response number four avoiding\nhelp even when you need it asking for\nhelp can be incredibly difficult for\npeople that experience trauma or neglect\nas a child\nwhen asking for help goes poorly in\nchildhood you may find it hard to do so\nas an adult\nif as a child you were ignored belittled\nor worse you may hold on to this with\nother people you worry about their\nreaction or Worse their rejection Dr\nWebb from Psych Central States that\nhaving this dynamic between people that\nyou should trust early in life can make\nit extremely difficult go to anyone else\nlater when you're in a situation where\nyou need help it can quickly bring up\nfeelings of guilt hopelessness and\nworthlessness number five avoiding\nConflict at all costs\nconflict is never easy to deal with if\nyou've experienced a traumatic event or\nneglect early in life you may try to\navoid conflict at all costs as a defense\nmechanism licensed clinical social\nworker Sean Grover breaks down avoidance\ninto three categories\napologizing agreeing and accommodating\nyou may find yourself constantly saying\nsorry in excess perhaps you're overly\nagreeable even when something goes\nagainst you and your values lastly you\nmay notice that you always accommodate\nthe other person's needs at your expense\nyou're trying your best to avoid a\nproblem before it even becomes a problem\ndespite your efforts to avoid conflict\nyou may find that your relationships\nhave become unstable distant and in the\nend lost the conflict avoidance can\nescalate to a point where those closest\nare unable to reach you making you feel\nalone number six the media you consume\nthe media that we consume has a strong\ngrip on the emotions we feel TV movies\nnews articles music and more are all\nengineered to get an emotional reaction\nout of us sometimes this reaction can be\nunhealthy and can trigger something deep\nwithin seeing a similar trauma that\nrepresents your own can be detrimental\nto your mental space and may cause you\nto spiral media doesn't spare you the\nugly details which can make you feel\nlike you're reliving The Experience\nadditionally having a focus on dark\ntopics like death chaos and violence can\nmake turning to the news at all\nextremely unpleasant according to Dr\nJessica Hamblin from the dart Center for\njournalism and Trauma in 2019 says media\ncovering these types of topics can put\nyou in a vulnerable headspace making you\nmore susceptible to negative emotions\nand thoughts\nsometimes avoiding the news altogether\nand studying up on a film you're about\nto watch can be great ways to reduce\nexposure to unsettling topics and number\nseven\ntime and anniversaries\ntraumas are triggered by memories of\npast events making any detail a\npotential trigger whether the\nanniversary of a loved one's death is\napproaching or the date of a horrible\ntragedy is coming up you may find\nyourself more on edge than normal your\nbrain is really good at sensing patterns\nso any sign that an event anniversary is\ncoming up such as Seasons changing or\ncalendars moving up a month can serve as\na subconscious reminder\nresearch from the national Center for\nPTSD States this is our brain reminding\nus to be afraid of a horrible event\noccurring Dr Hamblin from the dart\nCenter for journalism and Trauma further\nexplains that when patterns emerge that\nare similar to when a horrible event\nhappened our brain kicks into gear to\nget us to safety\nwhile this can help us keep out of\ndanger in some scenarios in others it's\ncompletely unavoidable and consuming\nwhile trauma is incredibly difficult\nit's important to know that there is\nhelp and a way to heal from it we can't\nalways be aware when it's affecting us\nand to what extent but talking with a\nmental health professional can make this\nwork much easier\nif you've been through a traumatic event\nit's important to know that help is\npossible and that you are not alone\nreaching out to a qualified mental\nhealth professional can be a great first\nstep to getting your life back on track\nthanks so much for watching this video\nplease let us know your thoughts on this\ntopic in the comments below
