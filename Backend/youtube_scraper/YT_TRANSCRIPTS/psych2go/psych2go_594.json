actions\nand consequences they found that people\nwho practiced self-control in one area\nof their life were more likely to\nexercise self-control in other areas as\nwell the researchers suggested that the\nenergy created by self-control can spill\nover into other parts of our Lives which\nis pretty cool if you think about it\nit's not just about you though the law\nof cause and effect also applies to your\nrelationships with others by treating\nothers with kindness and respect you can\ncultivate positive relationships and\ncreate a supportive social network in\ncontrast negative

has\nbeen extensively studied in psychology\nDr Albert Ellis a prominent psychologist\nand founder of rational emotive behavior\ntherapy strongly believed in the power\nof your beliefs to influence your\nexperiences Dr Ellis argued that your\nthoughts and beliefs determine your\nemotional reactions to events in your\nlives and can either limit or expand\nyour potential for success research
