    "transcript": "clinical psychologist Dr Ellen\nHendrickson says responsibility is\ntypically a positive trait because it\nshows you're dedicated trustworthy\naccountable and concerned about others\nit's the polar opposite of avoiding\nresponsibility by blaming others or\nmaking excuses but it's possible to go\noverboard\ndue to everyone else's chores if someone\nbumps into you do you apologize do you\nbelieve it's your fault if someone you\ncare about is irritable\nindeed it's a mark of maturity when you\nown your mistakes however you become\noverly responsible when you own other\npeople's faults and blunders Dr Ellen\nstated that feeling overly responsible\ncan be a main symptom of\nobsessive-compulsive disorder OCD she\ngave the example of a client who was\ncertain she was to blame when a tree\nfell on her car During a severe\nrainstorm claiming I shouldn't have\nparked it there I should have known\nlet's view this from a different lens\nlet's say there isn't any OCD present\nwhat causes non-diagnosable yet toxic\nover responsibility according to Dr\nEllen like many maladaptive beliefs it\ntypically begins in childhood\nchildren who are blamed for matters they\nhave no control over like their parents\nfeelings or financial circumstances\nbegin to feel they are truly responsible\nto know whether or not you are overly\nresponsible it's good to know the things\nyou shouldn't be responsible for so here\nare some things to keep an eye out for\nother people's feelings\nhave you ever felt like it's your fault\nif your loved one is unhappy do you\nthink that it's your responsibility to\nfix their problems and remove their pain\nyou hold a basic core belief that their\npain equals your fault according to a\nlicensed couple and family therapist Dr\naziel romanelli these kinds of beliefs\nlead to reactionary behavior in close\nrelationships when your loved one talks\nabout something distressing you stop\nopenly listening and you think of ways\nthat you can relieve their suffering\nand is this automatic reactivity that\nkeeps you in a symbiotic relationship\nwhere both people are reluctant to show\ntheir pain as your Agony equals their\nproblem you might find that you start to\navoid sharing your frustrations because\nyou believe it'll ultimately hurt your\nloved one\nin a healthy relationship you know their\nemotional happiness is not your\nresponsibility\nit doesn't mean you ignore their\nsuffering but instead you set good\nboundaries and let your loved ones know\nthat you are there to support them while\nthey deal with their personal issues\nothers bad habits\nwhen your loved one has bad habits do\nyou bend over backwards to help them\nignoring your own time or resources even\nif they tell you that they like to work\nit out themselves you believe that you\nknow the best way to break the bad\nhabits licensed professional counselor\nSarah Allen Benton says there is\nabsolutely nothing wrong with helping\nyour loved ones to drop their bad habits\nbut it starts to become a problem when\nyour self-worth is connected to being\nneeded and you believe that your purpose\nis helping others to the point of\nburnout this is known as Savior complex\nor White Knight syndrome individuals\nwith this syndrome are willing to assist\nthose who are desperate for help often\nat the expense of their own needs\nwanting to become a rescuer means you\nprevent your loved ones from accepting\nresponsibility for their own actions and\nhelping themselves\nothers mistakes\ndo you blame yourself when someone else\nmakes a mistake do you wake up at night\nwondering how did I cause them to make\nthat mistake as you play this self-blame\ngame you feel more emotionally depleted\nfatigued miserable and upset\nso what causes us to self-blame\naccording to licensed marriage and\nfamily therapist Dr Gary Bell in his\npodcast a life of regret\nit's simpler to blame ourselves for\nother people's mistakes than to examine\nthe issue and assign responsibility\nwhere it belongs also we might often\nfind ourselves turning a blind eye to a\nblunder by our loved ones we don't want\nto blame them and remove them from their\npedestal or face the reality that\nperhaps they might not make our lives\nbetter\n's needs take this scenario you're\nwatching a basketball game on TV with\nyour friends while munching on that\ndelicious pepperoni pizza\nit's now down to one slice would you\nallow your friend to finish that last\nslice or would you grab it and save her\nevery last bit of it if you chose the\nfirst option you are portraying\nCooperative Behavior or what the\nresearchers in the Journal of\nPersonality and individual differences\nreferred to as others centeredness\nresearcher Ryan Byerly defined others\ncenteredness as a tendency to put others\ninterests ahead of One's Own that is\nbased on a specific way of thinking\nindividuals with other Center thinking\nview their personal interests as equally\nimportant to others interpersonal\ninteractions are however very important\nto them this is different to when you\nare excessively concerned about the\nwell-being of others which is known as\nunmitigated communion\nwhen someone has unmitigated communion\nor high other Focus they may prioritize\nothers out of concern that they can't be\nsatisfied unless they fulfill other\npeople's needs and finally other\npeople's dreams imagine this you are a\nYouTube travel influencer and many of\nyour commenters say you should visit the\nnewly opened Harry Potter theme park in\na distant land\nyou'll realize if you fulfill this wish\nof your fans to live vicariously through\nyou you have to spend an outrageous\namount of money\ndo you think you're responsible to Grant\nyour audience this wish even though your\ncurrent finances don't allow it here's a\nmore common example\nparents who view their children as a\nsecond chance to fulfill their own\ndreams according to Brad Bushman one of\nthe researchers of my child redeems My\nBroken Dreams on parents transferring\ntheir unfulfilled Ambitions onto their\nchild these parents regard their\nchildren as extensions of themselves\nrather than as separate people with\ntheir own hopes and dreams failing to\nachieve their dreams they want their\nkids to do so\nremember it's not your responsibility to\nfulfill other people's dreams when you\nbear too much responsibility for things\nyou shouldn't be you may become\nfrustrated resentful and feel taken\nadvantage of\noh changing such behavior is challenging\nit is possible if you acknowledge how it\ncan negatively impact your interpersonal\nrelationships can you relate to any of\nthese points I can if so share with us\nin the comments the references are\nlisted in the description below thanks\nfor watching and keep an eye out for\nmore SCI"
