be kind but\nyou're worried that being nice is\nstarting to cost you your mental health\ntherapist Robert typey warns that people\nwho are always nice tend to hold in\nnegative emotions often resulting in\ndepression anxiety and addiction in case\nyou're wondering if this might be you\nand what you can do about it keep\nwatching for signs you're too kind for\nyour own good people pleaser\nthere's a fine line between being kind\nand being too kind for your own good a\npsychotherapist Sharon Martin explains\nthat people placers crossed that line\nwhen being generous turns into\nself-abandonment do you ever worry that\npeople will protect you if you share\nyour true thoughts and opinions so you\njust keep them to yourself and be\nagreeable\nwhen being kind camouflages your true\nthoughts or feelings you can end up\nabandoning who you really are\npsychotherapist Dr Beaumont helps give a\nreason for this Behavior saying most\nlikely somewhere along the line you've\nneeded to fit in for your own\nself-preservation this part of ourselves\nis called the adopted child we adapt to\nget our needs fulfilled always saying\nI'm sorry\nmaybe you're the type of person who\napologizes for everything and anything\nyou apologize when asking a question in\nclass or for not understanding something\nmaybe you apologize to your friends and\nfamily for taking up their time these\nare just a few examples of things you\nshouldn't feel guilty about or apologize\nfor it's important to ask questions when\nlearning and if someone makes you feel\nguilty for spending time with them they\naren't your true friends if you're\nalways saying I'm sorry when you have\nnothing to be sorry for this could be a\nclear sign that you're being too kind\naccording to nurturing Minds counseling\nit's always yes\nis saying no a foreign concept to you\nmaybe even the idea of saying no feels\nlike it would take Supernatural strength\ntherapist Diana Garcia says that you're\nbeing too kind when you say yes no\nmatter what even when you don't want to\ndo the request or you don't have the\ntime energy or resources to take it in\nit's important to say no sometimes\nespecially when it means protecting your\ninner peace or staying true to yourself\nnot everyone's opinion matters have you\never stopped pursuing one of your goals\nbecause you were worried people would\nmake fun of you or are you choosing a\nlife path because it's what the people\nin your life think you should do but\nwhat make you miserable\none of the big signs of people pleasing\nis thinking everyone's opinions matter\nequally you try to make everyone happy\nall the time without differentiating\nwhose opinions matter most and whose\nopinions you can dismiss it says\npsychotherapist Sharon Martin of course\nthere will be times when you will rely\non the opinion of others like when\nreceiving medical advice or getting\nadvice from someone you look up to and\nfeel safe with but if you don't admire\nthem or they're outright mean to you\ntheir opinion shouldn't matter but yours\nshould\nit's not your responsibility you are not\nresponsible for other people's\nexperiences or feelings says therapist\nDiana Garcia of course there are\ncircumstances where you may hurt\nsomeone's feelings and you need to\napologize and take accountability but if\nyou aren't the cause for their feelings\nyou shouldn't feel responsible for their\nemotions or reaction\ndo you often take on the blame even if\nwhat happened has nothing to do with you\nhave you ever ordered takeout for your\nfriends or family in the restaurant\nforgot someone's order even though you\nordered it correctly and it's not your\nfault did you keep apologizing to your\nfriends and family feeling like you\nruined that evening and it was all your\nfault psychologist Dr lag says that\npeople-pleasing involves Readiness to\ntake on blame even when what happened\nhas nothing to do with you conflict\nterrifies you\nit's impossible to avoid conflict the\nonly way to avoid conflict is if you\nsuppress your feelings wants and needs\nsays psychotherapist Sharon Martin\nthe problem with suppressing your\nfeelings is that it doesn't make them go\naway instead it only makes them grow\nwhich can turn into resentment passive\naggressiveness and even physical pain\nunhealthy conflict can feel scary but\nSharon explains that conflict doesn't\nhave to involve name-calling yelling or\nthreats in contrast there can be a\nhealthy conflict where both parties can\nrespectfully Express their opinions that\ncan result in Greater understanding and\nchanges that will ultimately strengthen\nthe relationship what about you\na common misconception according to\nnurturing Minds counseling is when you\ndon't want to burden or bother anyone so\nyou do everything yourself the problem\nis it's impossible to do everything\nyourself starting from the time that\nwe're born until old age there will be\ntimes when we need help it's impossible\nnot to\nyou can't learn how to ride a bike on\nyour own or how to drive by yourself for\ninstance and you won't be able to build\nyour dream life or your dream home all\nby yourself these things require the\nhelp of someone else and usually a\ncommunity of people the truth is\neverybody needs help in life it's just\npart of Being Human\ndoes this mean you shouldn't be nice not\nat all but there's a big difference\nbetween being kind because of your\nvalues versus being kind because you're\nscared Robert tyvee explains that being\noverly kind is less about your values\nand more a psychological response to\nprotect you from what seems to be a\nscary world\nit's okay to be scared but it's also\nimportant to start showing yourself the\nkindness you give so freely to others\nit's your turn and it's been your turn\nfor a while\ndid you find this video helpful I know I\ndid if you did too please let us know\nbelow thank you for
