too sex\nexpert and relationship coach Carmel\nJones explained to Cosmopolitan that\nsexual tension is basically the feeling\nthat something sexual needs to happen to\nresolve the tension between two or more\npeople relationship therapist and sex\neducator Rachel Wright also explained\nthat it usually happens before any\nsexual contact is made noting that\nsexual tension can linger for weeks or\neven years after contact is made\nso how can we tell if this Crush of\nyours feels that tension too or rather\nhow do you know if this is sexual\ntension or just butterflies in your\nstomach well here are some signs there's\nlikely sexual tension between the two of\nyou feeling euphoric to the heart races\nas your crush entered the room usually\nbefore you would get a gentle smile and\nbutterflies in your stomach but now\nthere's something more between the two\nof you suddenly you feel your heart\nstart to race\naccording to Healthline attraction\ncauses a boost in the chemical's\noxytocin dopamine and norepinephrine\nthis surge of chemicals can make you\nfeel euphoric and cause physical\nreactions like making your heart race\nfaster\nif you're feeling a bit euphoric just at\nthe mere sight of them and it gets even\nmore intense when they look at you it\nmay just be sexual tension\nholding that eye contact\nhow long do you two hold eye contact\nwith each other think about how long you\nmake eye contact with your friends and\nacquaintances then compare that with\nyour crush\nis there a lingering moment before\nturning away\nHealthline explains it the koi gaze\nwhere you make eye contact and then look\naway is the common nonverbal flirting\ncue according to a 2014 study that\nlooked at flirting Styles this type of\nflirting is bound to be present between\nthe both of you when there's sexual\nattention can you feel their gaze\nalways on your mind\nyou just can't seem to get distracted\nthey're always on your mind do they\nrandomly pop up in your thoughts when\nthey're there do you have a difficult\ntime focusing do you find yourself lost\nin a daydream about them sure crushes\ncan fall into your Daydreams but when\ntheir sexual tension is well it may be\neven more difficult to stay focused when\nthey're around\nif they're always on your mind you may\neven bring them up to others all the\ntime\nan article from Healthline explains that\nif you keep bringing them up in convos\nthat really have nothing to do with them\nit's called mention itis and if you have\nsexual attention with someone chances\nare you're guilty of it guilty or not\nguilty\nhow do they hug you\ntouch you Rachel Hoffman explained to\nInsider that when someone likes you\nhe'll put his hands around your back\nwhen he's talking or maybe he guides you\nthrough a crowded bar she adds that if\nhe reaches for your hand then you can\nalmost guarantee that he's into you\nanother way to possibly see if they feel\nsexual attention is to see how long\ntheir hugs last with you is it a\nlingering hug on their end a brush of\nthe hand afterwards or a click pat on\nthe back with no eye contact\ntouch can be very important when it\ncomes to initial sexual attention if you\nlike them you're hoping for the\nlingering hug folks\nwhy am I smiling why are you so funny\nthey tell an unfunny joke yet somehow\nyou can't stop smiling and laughing\nresearcher and award-winning sex\neducator Justin limiller PhD explains in\nmen's health that when people feel an\noverwhelming attraction to each other a\nlot of positive effects tend to be\nexchanged and that includes frequent\nsmiles even simply looking at your crush\nmakes you smile you can't help but feel\nthat energy that tension and smile at\nthe first sign of eye contact unless\nyou've already shyly turned away the\nMiller also explains that smiling is a\nnatural response when someone makes you\nfeel good and it creates this feedback\nloop where one person smiles and that\ngets the other to smile even more the\nMiller notes it's also the case that\nwhen you're really into another person\nyou tend to think all of their jokes are\nfunnier\nah so that's why there's suddenly a\ncomedian in your eyes\nawkward or flirty if you notice your\ncrush flirting with you you're off to a\ngood start maybe there's some\nlight-hearted flirty teasing or maybe\nthey often compliment you with some\nflirty eye contact but what if they're\nnaturally shy what if you're naturally\nshy that may leave you with less flirty\ninteractions initially in a few moments\nof still silence between the both of you\nand then suddenly you're asking yourself\nis this sexual tension it's a bit\nawkward but you still feel the spark\nbetween the two of you\nyou could always ask them first but if\nyou'd first like a hint as to what they\nmight be feeling view the situation\nunbiasedly and look for those smiles and\nGiggles as well as those gazes and\nlingering touches notice their body\nlanguage and how they react before\nassuming your feelings mean they feel\nthe same way do they look uncomfortable\nor are they smiling and meeting your\ngaze but most importantly know that\nawkwardness isn't always a bad sign in\nfact those moments of silence or awkward\npauses between the both of you opening\nup about yourself can foster intimacy\naccording to psychotherapist Dr David\nbratcher the birth of intimacy is often\nawkward we put ourselves on the line by\nrevealing our innermost thoughts and\nfeelings we make ourselves vulnerable to\npainful rejection if we are too afraid\nof appearing awkward we may keep others\nat a distance we may also find we\nattract those who would rather keep\nthings superficial so perhaps it's best\nto enjoy that silent moment after a nice\nflirt that way you can really sense the\nsexual attention if it's present be sure\nto look out for their body language as\nwell are they smiling enthusiastically\nflirting or are they shifting\nuncomfortably in their seat looking\ntowards the door avoiding eye contact at\nall costs\nlet's hope they think you're an amazing\ncomedian instead so do you think there's\nsexual tension between you and your\ncrush share with us in the comments down\nbelow when in doubt just ask them if\nthey're as attracted to you as you are\nto them or simply ask them on a date to\nsee if you both feel that emotional\nconnection and sexual attention we hope\nyou enjoyed this video and if you did\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a friend or Crush\nsubscribe to seg2go and hit the\nnotification Bell icon for
