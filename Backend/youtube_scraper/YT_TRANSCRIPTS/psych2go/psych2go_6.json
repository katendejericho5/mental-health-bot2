    "transcript": "psychiatric disorders come in a variety\nof forms while you likely know someone\nwith certain illnesses like anxiety\ndepression and schizophrenia there are\nothers that are less common in a\nprevious video we talked about 10 rare\nmental disorders to know about to shed\nlight on some of these unusual\nconditions to follow up on that video\nand highlight more of these uncommon\ndisorders let's explore six rare\ndisorders that you should know about\nreactive attachment disorder something\nwe've covered before on this channel is\nattachment Styles when a positive\nattachment develops this allows the\nchild to bond and grow emotionally\nhowever something called reactive\nattachment disorder or rad prevents this\nbond from ever occurring the Cleveland\nClinic states that most cases of rad\noccur in very young children as a\nresponse to abuse and neglect this can\nalso happen with older children\nespecially those with unstable home\nlives with rad children struggle to form\nhealthy bonds with others may not\nrespond to or show affection and often\navoid social\nsituations selective mutism we know lots\nof people who like to hear themselves\ntalk but what about someone whose\nanxiety doesn't allow them to speak in\ncertain situations The Selective mutism\nCenter explains that while some kids are\nnaturally chatty and others quiet those\nwith Selective mutism will not speak in\ncertain circumstances for example a\nchild May Comm communicate well at home\nbut will not at school the American\nspeech language hearing Association\ndescribes selective mutism as part of an\nanxiety disorder it states there is also\nevidence of there being a genetic\ncomponent that a parent with an anxiety\ndisorder typically passes down while\nselective mutism can occur with other\nconditions like autism spectrum disorder\nsensory processing issues or hearing\nproblems it can stand on its own without\nany co-occurring condition p have you\never wondered what some nonedible item\nwould taste like remember the tide pod\nchallenge turns out not all brightly\ncolored liquid is fruit juice most of us\ncan easily identify what is food and\nwhat isn't by taking one bite however\npeople with P will have the compulsion\nto eat particular objects that are\ninedible Healthline explains that P\nmostly occurs in people with certain\nvitamin deficiencies and is commonly\nseen in children and pregnant people\nsince it's a compulsion a person\ndiagnosed with Pica may eat something\neven if it is dangerous and against\ntheir better judgment a common item\neaten by those with p is chalk which is\nlinked to low iron and zinc levels some\nother common items are paint and even\ndirt in some severe cases people with P\nhave to undergo procedures to remove\nthese objects and toxins from their\nbodies that they've consumed aotm nilia\nfor most people getting in an accident\nwhere you lose a lum would be very\ntraumatic for those with aemilia they\nhave an overwhelming desire to amputate\na healthy LM while this is shocking\naccording to the Cambridge University\npress people with this disorder feel\nthat a part of their body such as a hand\nor leg is wrong and will experience\nsignificant discomfort in having it for\nsome it is a sexual compulsion for\nothers it isn't it can be incredibly\ndistressing for the person with the\ncondition so distressing that they may\nmake efforts to undergo a medical\nprocedure to get their limb amputated\nsome of us can barely get a shot without\ncrying let alone a full\namputation\nkleptomania as kids we usually learn not\nto touch things that aren't ours with\nkleptomania you have an Impulse to steal\nsomething that isn't yours the Mayo\nClinic explains that someone with this\ndisorder will feel relief after stealing\nan item similar to the way a smoker\nmight after their first puff of a\ncigarette before stealing they may feel\nanxious jittery and out of sorts but\nfeel relieved by taking something\nkleptomania is a compulsion that needs\nto be acted upon they may not care about\nthe items they steal or even that\nthey're stealing something from someone\nclose to them it's to satisfy the urge\ngenerally it happens in episodes and is\nnot something that can be stopped\nthrough willpower even the significant\nlegal consequences will not stop them\nEEG bomb syndrome unless you're Indiana\nJones creepy crawlies tend to creep most\nof us out just thinking about a bug\ninfestation is uncomfortable imagine\nwhat if you had bugs inside of\nyou egg bom syndrome is a type of\ndelusion where a person will believe\nthat they have a bug or parasite\ninfestation inside them they have\nsensations of something crawling inside\nof them that feel real so they will seek\nmedical attention even though nothing is\nthere since it's a delusion the\nindividual is less likely to be aware of\nthis therefore EEG bomb syndrome is\ntreated in a similar manner to other\npsychotic symptoms even though there's\nmedical evidence that they're healthy\nthey will never be convinced while there\nare many areas of mental health that are\nwell known and researched there are many\nmore rare conditions that we are still\nlearning about if you know of another\nrare illness or are even diagnosed with\none and feel comfortable sharing let us\nknow in the
