    "transcript": "foreign\nhi so we are constantly being bombarded\nby unexpected surprises from acute\nchanges of plans to sometimes more\nchronic challenges that test our sense\nof identity\nso how do we really change these um\nstressors or setbacks to Stepping Stones\nto help us achieve our best selves\nI'm Monica and I'm a medical student an\naspiring neuroscientist and also the\nhost of the ask and expert series\ntoday we'll be talking about all things\nresilience\nand I really have a great honor to chat\nwith Dr Maya Shanker an incredible woman\nshe is a cognitive neuroscientist who\nhas redefined challenges as\nopportunities and has really achieved\nincredible achievements\nshe has pivoted from being an esteemed\nconcert violinist student of the\nPearlman to serving as the first\nBehavioral Science advisor to the UN\nsenior advisor in the Obama White House\nto executive producer of her own podcast\na slight change of plans\nwelcome Maya thanks so much for having\nme Monica so much fun to be here\nthank you so much for taking the time to\nchat with me and sharing your expertise\non all things resilience you have such\nan incredible story\nthank you so much it's very kind of you\nto say\nso I thought it might be a great way to\nstart just to provide a little bit of an\noverview of your journey from being a\nconcert violinist to being the\ninspirational cognitive neuroscientist\ncognitive scientists as you are today\nyeah so when I was a kid the violin was\nthe center of my life I started playing\nwhen I was six years old\num my grandmother had actually played\nviolin in an Indian classical style when\nshe was growing up as a young girl in\nIndia and\num My Grandmother Had gifted my mom her\ninstrument when my parents immigrated to\nthis country in the 70s so the violin\nwas sitting in our attic and one day\nwhen I was six you know my older three\nsiblings had decided they didn't want to\nplay violin and my mom went up to the\nattic and brought down my grandmother's\nviolin and opened the case and I think\nin part because I felt really attached\nto her\num I immediately developed an affinity\nfor the violin right there was an\nemotional attachment kind of in place\nand\num when I was nine I started studying at\nthe Juilliard School of Music in New\nYork so every Saturday my mom and I\nwould wake up at four in the morning to\ncatch a train to New York I would spend\n10 hours\num every day or sorry every Saturday\ntaking all sorts of classes like\nOrchestra and chamber music and music\ntheory and\num you know private lessons and\nperformance and all that stuff and I it\nreally was my dream Monica to go pro you\nknow I I really felt like you mentioned\nPearlman when I was a teenager it's like\nPearlman invited me to be his private\nstudent and that was really the vote of\nconfidence I felt they needed\num to really try to see if I could\nbecome a professional\nand then just as my career was on the up\nand up I had my slight change of plans\num I was I was practicing early one\nmorning I over stretched my finger on a\nsingle note and um tore a tendon heard a\npopping sound and eventually doctors\ntold me that I could never play again\nand I found it so disorienting to lose\nthe violin\num because I think it had defined so\nmuch of my identity I mean one thing\nI've learned about change is that one of\nthe reasons it feels so hard one of the\nreasons why change is so scary is that\nit often does involve a loss of identity\na shift in identity and so\nbecause I was so Tethered to the violin\nwhen I lost the instrument I found\nmyself grieving not just the you know\ninability I found myself reading not\njust the violin but a huge part of\nmyself right I felt like a huge part of\nmyself kind of left with me with the\nviolin so\num\nit took me a really long time to figure\nout\nwhat I could ground myself in right and\nlike where I could find passion again\nand that was a process of discovery it\ntook a really long time to figure things\nout\num but I learned a really valuable\nlesson from that experience that I'm\nhoping can help your viewers navigate\nchange is a little bit more resilience\nand a bit more equanimity which is that\nI think as humans we all really have a\ndesire to attach ourselves to specific\nidentities\num it's core to who we are I think it's\nhow we feel more stable during times of\nchange and\num you know gets at that current of lots\nof unexpected intense turmoil we want to\nfeel like something remains stable\nsomething remains fixed and so I don't\nthink our desire to have those identity\nattachments is going anywhere but what I\nlearned from my experience is that we\ncan change what we anchor our identities\nto\nand what I decided to do over time and\nagain this is really through discoveries\nI made through a slight change of plans\nis that I realized that I could attach\nmy identity not to specific Pursuits\nlike being a violinist or being a\npodcaster being a cognitive scientist\nbut instead to the features of those\nPursuits that light me up so being\ndriven not by the what of what I do but\nwhy it is that I do it and when I ask\nmyself what was it about the violin that\nI really loved I realized that human\nconnection was at the core of my love of\nthe instrument so if you took away all\nthe superficial features of the violin\nand the performance element and all the\npractice stuff it really was magical to\nbe able to go on stage or play with my\nchamber musician classmates and\nhad the ability to feel something new\ntogether emotionally and that was a very\npowerful insight for me to have because\nwhat it what it empowered me to do is\nsay okay well human connection is what\nmakes you tick human connections what\nreally made you fall in love with the\nviolin in the first place now that the\nviolin's gone you could actually still\nfind that same love of human connection\nelsewhere and when I looked back on my\nlife I saw oh my gosh that actually is a\nthrough line it was true as a cognitive\nscientist where I studied the science of\nconnection it's definitely true in my\npodcast a slight change of plans where\nI'm interviewing people about the most\npersonal moments of their lives and\nwe're sharing that experience together\nand that has helped me feel a lot\nsturdier in my sense of self as I\nnavigate change because now I have\nsomething to hold on to even if my\ncircumstances change I now know okay\neven if God forbid I ever lose the\nability to do the podcast well I can\nstill find my love of human connection\nsomewhere else and so I would I would\nurge I want to give everyone a homework\nassignment who's tuning into this which\nis ask yourself what is your through\nline right what is the thing that really\nmakes you tick that sits underneath the\nsurface of those things that you love\ndoing in life and see\nexplore all the expressions of that\nunderlying passion and it'll allow you\nto see your identity as far richer and\nmore expansive than you might otherwise\nthat is such a beautiful way of seeing\nthings really seeing things as focusing\non themes rather than focusing on things\nthat's kind of how I took that all\ntogether it was really amazing can I ask\nyou that question so you're in medical\nschool right and yeah um you know\naspiring neuroscientists I'm curious to\nknow what is it that has drawn you to\nMedicine\nbecause you could say my tattoo is going\nto be of a doctor and I think it's so\nmuch fun to do the thought experiment of\nwell what is it about being a doctor\nthat you love and then you can hold on\nto that as part of your identity\nso before medicine I was a business\nschool major and you know being a\nbusiness school major we didn't really\num specialize in anything yet but what\nwas always in the back of my mind was I\nwonder how people interpret products I\nwonder how people interpret marketing\nthings things like that and through the\nyears I realized that\nthe core of it was\nwhat was in the brain like how do people\nlike why do people think the way that\nthey do how do they think the way that\nthey do and so I made a slight change of\nplans I decided to I decided to just do\na little switch and then I ended up\nstudying psychology followed by\nNeuroscience\nand that's when I realized that\nit's so interesting to learn about the\nsocial aspects but\nwhat really explains our behaviors is a\nmix of both it's a mix of our biology\nit's a mix of our external factors and I\nthought Psychiatry medicine would give\nme the perfect combination of that and\nso that began my whole\num beginnings of learning science for\nthe first time learning chemistry like I\ndid not even know what a molecule was\nback in the first year and really\nstarting to build those building blocks\nto get to pursue what I want and I think\nit's very similarly to you it's really\nthat human connection to really\nunderstand the biology the sociology all\nthe different factors that make us who\nwe are the way that we connect to people\nthe way that we can share our stories\nand the way that we can hear other\nstories as well\nyeah it seems like your thing is\ncuriosity about the human mind and how\nit works and of course I share that\npassion so we're very similar that's\nwonderful thanks for sharing resonated\noh yes of course and that's why I'm so\ngrateful to be a part of psych2go as\nwell just getting to hear the community\nstories and\num sharing what worked for me and then\nhearing from experts like yourself so\nit's just an incredible thing but I\nrealized that the process of me\ndiscovering my why took years honestly\nlike I had I had a lot of like those\ninformational interviews like my friend\nintroduced me to that Anthony and I\nwould just email current medical\nstudents at that time I would email\nentrepreneurs I would email anyone that\nI thought had us you know slightly\ninteresting thing going on about\nNeuroscience or psychology I would be\nlike hi it's me cold email truly\npowerful email just a short digression\nand\num that's how I found my why after years\nbut I would love to hear how you found\nout what process like for you\nyeah I I so resonate with that because\nit can take a very long time to figure\nout our why and as you saw from my story\na lot of the discovery was retroactive\nso if you'd ask me at the time why do\nyou love music I'm not quite sure I\ncould have put a pin on it as a 10 year\nold right it took a really long time for\nme to discover that\num but one one thing that Angela\nDuckworth shared with me so I had her as\na guest on an episode of a slight change\nof plans you know she's the grit and\nresilience expert so we talked about the\nscience of grit and one thing she shared\nis that oftentimes we can actually look\nback to the things we naturally\ngravitated towards in childhood as a way\nto unpack what our whys are so over time\nbecause of socializations and various\npressures and you know limited access to\nOpportunities our world necessarily gets\nconstrained I mean in many ways we're\nforced to sharpen our focus and like to\ncreate some sort of funnel so that we\nend up in a sustainable career but when\nwe're really little\nthe things we gravitate towards\ntypically according to Angela are things\nthat stick around I mean they can be\nfoundational parts of our personality\nand so\num she was saying that you know as a\nlittle kid she like loved hearing that\nhuman stories Who Loved storytelling and\nshe liked hearing about what was going\non and she found that when she and her\nhusband were looking to buy a new home\nhe was really focused on okay how many\nbeds brooms are there and you know how\nhigh are the ceiling so she was like\nwhat's the story of the couple that used\nto live here you know\num I want to know what the you know and\nso that passion kind of persisted for\npeople and so I I think one\nrecommendation I have there is think\nback to when you were a little kid and\nyou were given\nunstructured play time\nwhat were the things that you would\nnaturally do was it learning something\nnew was it engaging in imaginative play\nwas it um something really sporty\nbecause you love moving your body I mean\njust go to the most primitive level of\nthings and I think that can help give us\ninsights Because by the time we're\nadults so many things are coloring and\nshaping our minds and experiences it's\nhard to get access to that very organic\ninternal set of Passions\nthat really resonates with me I'm just\nthinking about that like thinking about\nmy childhood years as you were\nmentioning that and I I think that's\nvery true I would always when I was\nyounger I would pick out books I would\ngo to Chapters and I would just go to\nthe psychology section and just read on\nthat and I would just be like oh my\ngoodness I could stay here for the whole\nday and so here I am hoping to pursue\nthis kind of kind of wrong with things I\nI would turn every conversation I had\ninto some sort of deep conversation even\nwhen I was a little kid so I think that\nwas probably kind of reflected I was\nvery curious about people I would always\nask these questions to try to understand\nwhat they were about and what made them\ntick and certainly that's persisted over\ntime so that's really helpful\num and again our personalities\nabsolutely change over time and so I'm\nnot saying you're gonna get like a fully\nproper diagnosis about what it is that\nyou you love to do but it's a nice proxy\nand it's a good place to reacor yourself\nin\nyes for sure and I could also understand\nbecause as a child I also had so many\ninterests so I one thing I really wanted\nto do was uh be an architect so I when I\nwas there I collected these smarty boxes\nI would empty out the smart they're all\nthe smarties keep the boxes and like try\nto build houses out of them because that\nwas my way of kind of Designing my dream\nhome hopefully being an artist\nit was a very cute thing but uh kind of\nI think my point would be like they're\nfor a child for anyone who has so many\ninterests to then go pro at something\nwould mean that you would have to\nsacrifice your time on focusing other\nthings pursuing other interests\num so what is what is your thought on\nhow to balance finding that Spike versus\npursuing the other interests and you\nknow all the things associated with that\nyeah it's a fantastic question it's one\nI've been thinking a lot about just you\nknow specialization versus exposure\num and reading books about this like\nrange um I don't know if you heard of\nthe death of a grade but it's really\ntalking about you know specialization\nversus you know exposure to a broad set\nof things and um one thing that my\nparents were really intense so as I\nmentioned I'm one of four kids\num they really tried and my mom in\nparticular tried to expose us to as many\nthings as she possibly could When We\nWere Young\num so in addition to music I was doing\ntheater camps I was doing art classes\num played soccer like really a rich um\narray of extracurricular activities and\nin part you know her initial intention\nwas I just really want to find out what\nmy kids naturally loved so I don't have\nto like push them or force them into\nanything that they can naturally Express\nyou know I love this but I don't really\nlove ice skating or gymnastics but I\nreally you know enjoyed\num you know doing this club or whatever\nit was but I think the added benefit of\nthat approach is that and and\nmaintaining that balance over the course\nof my childhood because I continue to\naudition for the school play even when I\nwas in the throes of my Juilliard life\nright in sixth grade I took that\naudition really seriously I got to play\nRosie in this play called Really Rosie\nis that I think it made me a better\nmusician like I'm so confident that\nhaving exposure to A diversity of things\nin my life allowed me to bring a depth\nof emotionality to my music that I\nwouldn't have been able to bring to it\notherwise\nand\nyou can see that right I mean there are\nkids who practice like three times as\nmuch as I was practicing day to day but\nwhen your life is confined to a practice\nroom with four walls around you and\nyou're not experiencing things at school\nand social relationships and you're not\nexperiencing loss and challenges or\nbeing bullied or whatever the\ncomplexities of Life entail you have\njust a less Rich palette to bring to\nyour passions and your Artistic\nEndeavors and so I certainly found that\nwhile I might not have been the most\ntechnically gifted musician because I\nnever quite got in as many hours of\npractice as my peers I really feel like\nmy musicality was enriched and enhanced\nby having a more Balanced Life\num and and my parents really giving me\nthat freedom to always be a kid at the\nend of the day right it's like okay I\nwould have to wake up at 4 30 in the\nmorning and I have to\nboarding part of the sleepover but they\nwould make sure I went the night before\nso that I could decorate the pillowcases\nfor Katie's birthday party and then pick\nme up late at night and they were always\ntrying to accommodate uh to make sure\nthat I had this kind of exposure and I\nhad absolutely found in my adult life\nthat\nhaving a broad set of interests and of\ncourse you know I'm really focused when\nit comes to the podcast the slight\nchange of plans when it comes to my\ncareer as a cognitive scientist I'm not\nsaying I don't pour a ton of energy into\nthese things but I think having these\nbalancing you know just like this\nBalancing Act and there's a bunch of\nforces that are influencing my point of\nview on the world I think I just have a\nmore nuanced and richer perspective on\nthings that I'm really grateful for\nright I think I'm a better Storyteller\nbecause I'm a cognitive scientist right\nI think I'm a better cognitive scientist\nbecause I have the empathy I build\nthrough storytelling right so a lot of\nthese things work in beautiful ways um\nin Tandem and I I just want to make sure\nfolks are appreciating that especially\nthe Workaholics who are listening to\nthis who are thinking oh I just need to\nyou know I feel bad I'm wasting time I'm\nnot like you know doubling down there is\na benefit\num to that and um it can actually lead\nyou to be better in most of the things\nthat you pursue\nand as you're saying that I really sense\na strong human connection theme you know\nmusic it's a way that it's like a\nuniversal language everybody appreciates\nsome sort of music and under you as a\ncognitive scientist you understand\npeople ultimately it's the human\nconnection so I see the themes\nthroughout just looking back to our\nearlier conversation about uh focusing\non things rather than things\nsorry and I just like to say I've always\nbeen so fascinated by stories where\npeople would tell me I I'm a doctor for\nexample but I'm also an avid skier I'm\nalso an avid musician I'm just so\nfascinated to see how things come\ntogether because it's I would say quite\nrare to find people who\nare like you just doing so many amazing\nthings in such intricate ways and uh it\njust it truly is so inspiring for me so\nthank you so much for sharing\nyeah and again I mean if a lot of it is\nabout balance too right there have been\nlots of things that\nis it a human and I require eight to\nnine hours of sleep every night I'm not\none of those people that is a super\nsleeper and I I really value you know\ngetting fresh air every day exercising\nall that stuff and so you certainly have\nto draw limits\num but I think that you can richly\ninvest in at least a few things in your\nlife at any given time and that will\nhave a net positive impact\noh I would also just like to add and I'd\nlove to hear your thoughts on this as\nwell yeah how do you know what to say\nyes to you when there are so many\nexciting opportunities out there\ngosh that is a really hard question\num\npart of it is\nso I try not to let regret guide me too\nmuch in my thinking so regret is this\nreally powerful negative force that we\nhave in our brains all the time it\nactually leads us to make lots of\ndecisions that might not be in our best\ninterest but we're trying to minimize\nregret so we're always like oh I think I\nshould take this job because I regret it\ndown the line and sometimes that's a\nvaluable signal because what you think\nyou might regret speaks to what your\ncurrent day values are what you think\nyour future values might be\num but it's not always cognitively\naccurate sometimes we can Mis forecast\nthe things that we will regret down the\nline and so I actually try to take the\nmost present-minded approach to saying\nyes or no to things rather than putting\nit in the regret framework I say is this\na thing that would wake me up tomorrow\nand get me excited about the day and\nit's really that simple and I find that\nsometimes when we take out the\ncomplexity of decision making about like\nhow am I going to feel about this when\nI'm 45 and how I'm gonna feel about this\non my deathbed it actually simplifies\nthe decision-making calculus it's like\ngiven who I am today do I Kama Maya want\nto do this thing over the next two\nmonths and if the answer is no but I\njust think future me would have wanted\nit I typically just say no\num and so far that's actually worked\nquite well I think we tend to over index\non feelings of regret and some of the\nresearch to show this and so um I've\nbeen I've been on like an anti-regret\nI've tried to introduce an anti-regret\ndecision framework into my life it has\nworked pretty well\nI hear a lot of themes of like focusing\non the present and I just draw so many\nparallels with the idea of mindfulness\nso I love that because I I think I'm\nalso quite similar so\num when I try to think about what I want\nto do yes or no I actually follow Ali\nabdall I don't know if you're aware of\nhim he's just a he's a YouTuber\nproductivity expert and his idea that I\nlately just stole so credit to him is\nthe hell yes or no method which is quite\nsimilar in the sense that if someone\nasks you do you want to do X the instant\nthe Instinct of oh my goodness yes\nequals\nyeah well let's let's consider it\nwhereas oh I'm not quite sure maybe if\nit if it takes like a second thought\nthen perhaps say for later so I run my\nlife by that and I'm gonna definitely\nadd on the focus of being in the present\nfrom yours\nthe reason I think this is important is\nthat there's a lot of research showing\nthat we are a bad cognitive forecasters\nwe're pretty bad at predicting what our\nfuture selves will be like what will\nmake us happy what our preferences will\nbe how different events will impact us\non a well-being level and so when we do\ntoo much forecasting that could be a\nproblem at the same time I will say I'm\nnot like a lobbyist for always\npresent-minded thinking I think it is\nmarvelous and miraculous that we as\nhumans can travel in time that we can\nspend time like marinating in the past\nor imagining what the future might be\nthis is a part of our minds that like I\nthink in modern day Society people have\ncome to resent it's like how come I\ncan't just be you know focused on the\npresent why can't I just be in the here\nand now and I'm not sure that's the\nright way to think about things I think\nthat if you find yourself drifting off\ninto the future and imagining things and\nit's not harmful to your well-being\nMarvel at that be amazed that we as a\nspecies can even do this kind of mental\ntime travel because I think it actually\nmakes for an incredible existence\num it allows us to sometimes escape a\npresent situation that's not great\num or allows us to dream really big or\nlearn from mistakes in the past and so I\njust I do also feel that we should be\nembracing a bit more we've moved too far\nin the direction of being present-minded\nthat I think sometimes we're losing a\nlittle bit of our\num\nof the value of actually being able to\ndo that mental time travel\nI can I just say I love the way that you\nthink it's really inspiring because it's\nso novel to me and I wonder if you would\nbe open to really kind of sharing more\nof your mindset for approaching New\nBeginnings for example when you started\nyour career as a cognitive science\nscientist and had to you know adapt to\nkind of Shifting Focus away from the\nmusic world\nyeah so a couple things come to mind\nhere well one you mentioned cold emails\nand I feel like I like I'm like the\nqueen of cold emails so I love that we I\nalready knew we shared a lot in common\nMonica but I feel like we extra share\nlots of things in common in terms of our\nhustle factor and trying to make things\nhappen it's probably worth sharing a\nreally quick story about how it is that\nI got into Juilliard in the first place\nbecause this is a very valuable lesson I\nlearned from my mom that I've carried\nwith me over the course of my career so\nwhen I was around nine my mom could tell\nokay Maya's ambition with the violin is\nvery quickly exceeding the connections\nthat I have into the Western classical\nmusic world like my parents are both\nacademics like they didn't have any\nexposure or meaningful Connections in\nthat space and and yet we both knew\nabout Juilliard and heard that this was\nlike the promised land for a young\nbudding inspiring concerts positions and\nso one day when I was in New York um\nwith my mom for the weekend I happened\nto have my violin with me and she\nbrought me to Lincoln centers that I\ncould see the Juilliard building from\nthe outside and just feel inspired by it\nand like see where all my musical Idols\nhave walked in and out and as if you're\npassing by the entrance my mom said why\ndon't we just go in Maya and like see\nwhat happens and I I was like not\nreacting well to this I was like what do\nyou mean just go in that's like totally\nnuts\num I you know she's like what's the\nworst thing that can happen and I'm like\nimagining security guards escorting us\noff the premises and being like who are\nyou so I can think of lots of lots of\nworst case scenarios but my youthful\nenthusiasm kicked in and ultimately I\nsaid yes and so we walked into the\nbuilding my mom struck up a conversation\nwith a fellow violin student\num and her mom and\num we learned that she was studying with\nthis amazing teacher and my mom just\nsaid hey would you mind making an\nintroduction to the teacher when your\ndaughter's lesson's over and they very\ngenerously said yes I found myself an\nhour later auditioning for this teacher\non the spot he accepted me to a summer\nboot camp uh that summer in which I was\npracticing hours a day under his\ntutelage and like really trying to skill\nup for the Juilliard audition that was\nin the fall and it was just a total game\nchanger for me Monica and I say that\nwith no false humility because I later\nlearned from my teacher at the time that\num he also did not think I had a chance\nof getting into Juilliard when I first\nmet him because he said he liked he\nliked my personality and my enthusiasm\num so that was why he wanted to give me\na chance and and yet you know that fall\nI auditioned and got in and that was\nbecause my mom's fearlessness opened a\ndoor that would not have existed for me\notherwise and I'm so grateful to her for\nteaching me that lesson because I've\nused it so many times I mean with the\nWhite House right I was an academic I\nwas doing my post-doc and cognitive\nneuroscience at Stanford I had no idea\nwhat would come next given that I\nrealized late into my academic career\nthat I did not want to be a professor\nwhich was really an oh crap moment\nbecause you've just spent years and\nyears and years doing the academic thing\nand then you're like oh God I don't\nactually think I have the right Tech for\nresearch and\nI thought okay it's you know it's become\na professor robust and then I talk to an\nold advisor of mine they tell me about\namazing work that's happening at the\nintersection of Behavioral Science and\npublic policy and I end up just sending\ncold emails to Obama advisors like\npitching them on the idea of creating a\nBehavioral Science team\num and creating a new position for a\nbehavioral scientist and ideally hiring\nme for that new role um which thankfully\nthey did and so that was like a huge\nleap of faith I know public policy\nexperience but it was just you know it\nwas equivalent of making that cold call\nmove into Juilliard that day and um even\nwith the podcast you know just like\nwriting up a pitch in my living room and\nthen just sending it off into the world\nand seeing what happens so I really\nreally encourage people and when we talk\nabout fearlessness and being okay with\nwith getting rejected and I've been\nrejected so many times\num but I really think if we internalize\nmy mom's a message like what's the worst\nthing that can happen the answers are\nusually just not that bad and\num it's so worth it I I've had despite\nall the rejections the numerator of\nsuccess stories you know is so worth\nwhatever the denominator of failures is\nand so\num yeah I'm just really I'm really\ngrateful for that\num the other thing that I think can help\nwith New Beginnings is\num\nseeing our identities as more valuable\nright so we talked about this a little\nbit I mean I now know being a cognitive\nscientist that what I face during the\nviolin years was what's called identity\nparalysis so you really do feel stuck in\nplace when a huge part of your identity\nhas been taken away from you and had I\nlearned to see myself as a more valuable\nentity that could take on a much broader\nrange of uh identities and\num you know loves right passions I think\nthat would have aided me well but it was\nsomething that at the time it was so\nmyopic I mean you were a concert pianist\nright you understand the kind of\ndiscipline and focus and like you just\nhave blinders on you're not aware of\nwhat's happening in the rest of the\nworld and so I think that would have\nserved me well\nso I hear throughout the story that\nthere's a lot of fearlessness a lot of\ninitiative a lot of calculated risk\ntaking and I know you mentioned Angela\nDuckworth in the beginning I am a huge\nfan by the way I love her book grits\num but I wanted to ask so if grit is\nbroken down to the power of passion and\nperseverance what do you think of the\nfundamental building blocks of\nresilience\noh that's a great question\num you know I actually there's a quote\nthat I have\num that I have near my computer which I\nlove and I like read it every single day\nand let me pull it up here so it comes\nfrom a conversation that I had so\nthere's the upcoming season of a slight\nchange of plans uh season seven and I\ninterviewed a guy named Dr Richie\nDavidson about the science of meditation\nso he's one of the Pioneers in\nmeditation science and that he's one of\nthe first people to have conducted a\nproper randomized control trial on the\nimpacts of meditation during a Time by\nthe way when the scientific Community\nbirds like what is this like why are we\neven taking this seriously from a\nscientific perspective so Richie is a\nbadass okay so I was talking with him\nabout what he calls Olympic meditators\nso these are people who have practiced\nmeditation for over sometimes 34 000\nhours so basically 34 000 hours more\nthan I practice meditation in my life\num and what they do is they they expose\nthem to this painful stimulus in the lab\nand they find when they scan their\nbrains that so the way the study works\nis you hear a beep and then you have the\npainful stimulus and then later you hear\nanother beat and then you have the\npainful stimulus yeah so assuming Monica\nyou're closer to me than you are to the\nOlympic mediter I'm just going to take\nthat for granted here's what our\nreactions will be like right so we hear\nthe first few beeps now we realize okay\nthe beep is associated with this painful\nstimulus so now the minute you hear the\nbeep you experience some kind of\nanticipatory anxiety right anticipatory\npain\nthen you have the stimulus and then it\ntakes you a while to come down from that\nnegative anticipatory or sorry from that\nnegative anxiety right and that negative\npain\nOlympic meditators have a very different\nneural response to this same experience\nwhen they hear the beep\nthere's nothing there's no there's no\nanticipatory anxiety\nthen the experience the pain it turns\nout the intensity of the pain for them\nis a little bit greater they're actually\nmore present with it and then there's no\ncome down from the pain\nso there's like literally\num you're rapidly coming down to your\nBaseline and he he says um so this is\nthe point I have like that is the neural\nresilient sorry that is the neural\nsignature of resilience\nyeah the capacity to rapidly come back\nto Baseline after adversity and showing\nessentially no anticipatory anxiety\nit was so interesting because I this\nquote so meaningful to me because one is\njust so beautiful like well sorry\nclearly I'm very nerdy because\nit was like so cool oh my God it's so\namazing but if you think about how\nrelevant this is to so many parts of our\nlife like my my husband\num he's like an amateur squash player\nbut he just like loves playing squash he\ntravels for squash that's like his true\npassion and we were talking about this\nquote in the context of when he's not\nplaying well or he has like a few bad\npoints you think about any athlete who's\nout there they have to so quickly\num come back from those feelings of\nadversity or you know feeling down or\ndiscouraged and immediately come back to\nBaseline and you know we all benefit\nfrom not having I feel like we all\nbenefit from limiting the amount of\nanticipatory anxiety we have about\nthings because I was reflecting on\nmyself and I was thinking you know in\nterms of my anxiety I feel like I spend\n50 of my anxious time being anxious\nabout things that have not happened yet\nand only like 50 is really devoted to\nthe anxiety of the thing actually\nhappening it's like I have so probably\nit's more than that actually 75 of my\nbrain is engineered towards anticipatory\nanxiety\num so anyway I just find this to be such\na beautiful idea that we can Aspire\nanyway to\nbe in a situation where we limit the\nanticipatory anxiety we limit\num how much time it takes for us to\nrestore our equilibrium and then we are\nreally just living in the present moment\nwhether that's painful or joyful\num and uh I asked him I remember sorry\nI'm just gonna interrupt a little bit\nlonger on this topic but I remember\nasking him like Richie okay I get that\nfor negative things we want to read on\nreally quickly and return to equilibrium\nbut what about when we experience\nawesome things like we go to a mate we\ngo to an amazing wedding and we're just\nlike on cloud nine because you just saw\nthis couple fall in love and they're the\nbest time ever or we have this delicious\nmeal or we just saw the best sports game\nof Our Lives I don't want to return to\nBaseline quickly so like are these\nOlympic meditators able to\nopportunistically choose when they want\nto let that you know negative stuff go\nor the glow persist right and he was\nsaying that there's some there are some\nphilosophers who believe that our\norientation as humans is fundamentally\npositive and optimistic and so all these\nother forces are coming into play\nthey're preventing us from feeling that\nway but if we were left to like our most\nnatural devices we might lean towards\nyou know being in that glow state or\nbeing a more positive state so I don't\nknow if I fully believe this and\ncertainly there are like mental\nconditions where it's just absolutely\nnot true like people who suffer from\nclinical depression Etc\num but it was a hopeful message and one\nthat I'm at least like you know it's\nmarinating I'm thinking it over\nthat's amazing that's a homework for\nmyself because I feel like I'm also\nquite the same like I always think about\nwhat am I doing tomorrow I have a whole\ncalendar situation going on like what am\nI doing tomorrow color code it I always\nstress about the things that haven't\nhappened yet and most of the time the\nthings the thing that actually\nsuggesting me for example an exam it's\nlike three hours the time I spent\nstressing about it\nthree weeks so my homework for myself\nis to try to reflect and introspect my\nemotions on the presently and then try\nto just focus more on that so I can\nspend more time doing what I want to be\ndoing feeling the ways I want to be\nfeeling instead of enterically feeling\nanxious so thank you for sharing\nso I I would I gave a TED Talk\num and it says probably for the talk I\nwas realizing that when it comes to\nchange and resilience you know I'm not a\nparticularly religious or spiritual\nperson so I don't have that soft Landing\num when bad things happen in life and\nI'm forced to figure them out or just a\nsurprising thing happens in life I just\ndon't have that to fall back on and\nI had this realization in creating this\ntalk that\npsychology is actually my soft Landing\nlike the fact that we can intentionally\nchange our frame of reference the way\nthat we think about something our\nperspective how we the narration that\ngoes on in our minds that is that can\nactually be a soft landing and I think\nthis is an example\num of that in real time which is we can\nactually figure out how it is that we\ncan change our relationship with anxiety\nthe story We Tell ourselves about our\nanxiety those things can be more in our\ncontrol than not and\nwhen we see our psychology as\nI don't know I would call it maybe\nsomething that we can be active collab\nlike I know our minds are us but it's\nlike you think about like kind of\nactively collaborating with your\npsychology as bizarre as that sounds but\nit's like you know it works in progress\na friendship where you're trying to\nfigure out okay well I do have this\nnegative tendency can I rework this can\nI reframe this I think that that is\nactually really empowering to Think\nThrough\nthat is so amazing I feel like we could\ndiscuss this for days and days and days\nbut I uh I recognize that\num the time for the podcast is coming to\na close but I really wanted to ask you a\nvery important question and that is what\nis next for you I just hear so much\nexcitement for all the amazing things\nthat are gonna happen I would just love\nsome insight into what's next\nso I am just genetically a planner I\nalways need to have The Five-Year Plan\nand the 10-year plan and I realize over\ntime that that is not very helpful and\nI've had too many curveballs in my life\nto defend that way of thinking anymore\nI feel enormously grateful that for the\nfirst time ever in my life I am so happy\nwith what I'm working on right now I\njust don't want things to change like I\nwant like what's ahead for me I hope is\nthe same thing as what I'm doing right\nnow and that's such a special feeling\nbut I\nI mean I'm just obsessed with making a\nslight change of plans it's just the\nperfect intersection for me my passions\nand my loves because I bring science and\nstorytelling and I marry them in in\norder to help us all understand how we\ncan navigate change better right\nstrategies and tools we can all use\num to become more resilient and it's\njust it's such a huge source of joy that\nI'm hoping that the future of Maya is\ngetting to make more of the show because\nother you know more people listen to it\nand and they love it and\num they find that it's it's helpful to\nthem\nthank you so much I've also for everyone\nwho is listening linked the podcast link\num so it links all the different places\nwhere you can listen to the podcast I\nwill also be listening I am so excited\nfor the new season so big\ncongratulations to you\nthank you so much Monica it was such a\npleasure to chat with you likewise I've\nlearned so much and I'm just really\ngrateful for the chat\nthanks so much thank you bye everyone\nuntil now bye everyone\nthanks"
