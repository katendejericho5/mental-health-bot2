    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Dr Anthony Yoon\nalso referred to America's referred to\nas America's holistic plastic surgeon\nand the host of his own amazing YouTube\nchannel Dr yoon's content on plastic\nsurgery skin care advice and beauty\nstandards has been viewed by millions of\nadoring fans due to being entertaining\nyet educational welcome Dr Yoon thank\nyou for joining us today\nwell thank you so much for having me on\ncourse you're a highly requested guest\npeople are so excited especially our\nviewers to see you here today oh thanks\nMichelle\nso can you tell us a little bit about\nyourself and your background\nyeah so I'm a board-certified plastic\nsurgeon I'm I've been in private\npractice in the Detroit area for 20\nyears and I've been uh really involved\nwith social media probably for the last\nseven or eight years\num and prior to that I did a lot of TV I\nwas on a lot of national TV shows I've\nwritten three books and my next book is\ngoing to come out in January called\nyounger for life\noh that's amazing wow and then um my\nfirst question is on the topic of\nself-esteem is what are the pros and\ncons of cosmetic surgery and what should\npeople consider before going under the\nknife\nyeah I mean the pros I think of plastic\nsurgery is that it can improve people's\nquality of life now you know I think\nthat there are different schools of\nthought when you think about plastic\nsurgery there are the extremes you know\nthere are some people who are getting an\ninsane amount of work done uh then there\nare people who are against it for\neverybody and I think like most things\nin life there is a reasonable medium\nsomewhere and the way that I explain to\nmy followers is to use plastic surgery\nas a last resort and that's always been\nthe thing because the worst thing that\ncan happen if you go under the knife is\nyou can die so we have to take it very\nvery seriously and unfortunately there\nare people in our society doctors\nplastic surgeons who aren't taking\ntaking it seriously enough and I think\nit's so important for us to keep in mind\nthat this isn't like getting your hair\ndone or getting makeup this is actual\nand actual surgery or a invasive\ncosmetic procedure\nabsolutely and then so in what ways do\nyou think that cosmetic surgery impacts\na person's self-esteem For Better or For\nWorse\num I think it can really help certain\npeople who have very defined issues with\nself-esteem especially self in their own\nself-image so for example I have a lot\nof patients of mine who have had let's\nsay three or four children and after\nhaving their kids they look at their\ntummy and they've got a lot of loose\nhanging skin of their tummy now they\nstill feel good about themselves you\nknow they're a mom they love their\nchildren they love their body and they\ndon't have anybody who's telling them\nyou should have this done but themselves\nthey may look in the mirror and say geez\nI would love to have the tummy closer to\nwhat I had before having the kids and\nnot have to deal with you know stuffing\nthis excess skin into my pants and all\nof that and those situations plastic\nsurgery can be very beneficial\num but it can be harmful for some people\nespecially if they have underlying\npsychological concerns you know they're\npeople who have body dysmorphia where\nwhat they see in the mirror is different\nthan what everybody else sees and for\nsome patients who have let's say by\ndysmorphia they may undergo multiple\ncosmetic surgeries as a way to try to\ntreat a problem that they perceive as a\nproblem that never really was there in\nthe first place and this can get very\ndangerous it can cause even patients\nsometimes to spiral uh psychologically\nbecause surgery was never really the\ntreatment for them in the first place\nexactly and in that case you would\nprobably recommend mental health\ntreatment right\nyeah I mean unfortunately you know I I\nencourage a lot of people to see therapy\nand I turn a lot of my patients down but\nI fear that they don't seek therapy that\nInsight isn't necessarily\num they don't necessarily have insight\ninto what their issue is and\nunfortunately a lot of them probably go\nto the doctor down the street and he'll\ndo it for them uh if you ask him to\nawesome\num no that makes sense and I love that\nlike you in your videos you promote like\nethical plastic surgery and do you think\nthat like maybe surgeons should get like\nMental Health Training before completing\ntheir residency or you know upon\ngraduating I mean honestly it's true\nthat as plastic surgeons we're\npsychiatrists with scalpels but we don't\nreally get a whole lot you know we don't\nget anything that's truly formal you\nknow when we when I did my training I\ndid follow let's say cosmetic plastic\nsurgeons and I saw how they treated\npatients and they talked to me about it\nand and taught me but there's no true\ncurriculum\non that at least when I went through\ntraining maybe there is some now but not\nto my knowledge do you think in some\nways plastic surgery can alter someone's\nself-concept\nI think it can alter so much of how you\nfeel about yourself and this can be good\nand bad you know the worst thing is when\nI have patients who come to see me\nwho've been botched and they went in for\nlet's say something fairly minor and\nthey come out feeling worse about\nthemselves than when they went in\nthere's always that risk with surgery\nand that's something that really is\nsomething I talk with my patients always\nbefore we go into the knife as I tell\nthem look worst case scenario it could\nlook like this do you want to take that\nrisk and in certain situations that risk\nis worthwhile for them in other\nsituations it's not but these are\ndiscussions that should be had with\npatients prior to going under the knife\nand unfortunately they're not always had\nthough\nwhat do you think like motivates a\nplastic surgeon to not have those\nconversations maybe just turn a blind\neye to it like even when they see that a\npatient could have like a mental health\nissue or body dysmorphia\nuh it's two things it's money and fame\nyou know so money is a big thing yeah\nyou know people want to make money and\nso there are doctors in my town where\nyou ask them to do something and they'll\ndo it doesn't matter what it is they'll\ndo it and they'll encourage you to do\nsome more stuff so they can make more\nmoney off of you and that's just ethics\nyou know there are people who are\nperforming plastic surgery who aren't\nreal plastic surgeons who have ER\ndoctors you have gynecologists you have\nfamily doctors who ditch their chosen\nprofession to masquerade as plastic\nsurgeons because they make more money\ndoing that they'll take weekend courses\nthey'll follow a doctor for a few days\nand then you know there's kind of an old\nsaying in in surgery see one do one\nteach one well there you go they see one\nand then they decide that they can try\nto do it and and this can be very very\ndangerous the second thing is Fame you\nknow there's something we've seen more\nwith the Advent of social media where\nthere are some doctors who are motivated\nby Fame and they want to be famous and\nthey look and see well who are the\nfamous people out there oh to be famous\nI need to be out there I need to be uh\nuh extreme you know I need to try to get\nattention and what do you do to get\nattention you do crazy stuff well there\nyou go they operate on people who maybe\ndon't need it they operate on\ncelebrities they may have some\npsychological underlying issues\nbasically as a way to get their face out\nthere\nwell and I don't know all the laws on\nthis but isn't it illegal for an ER\ndoctor to masquerade as a plastic\nsurgeon no no there is no law for that\nagainst there's no law that prohibits\nany doctor from performing any procedure\non a patient as long as they sign on the\ndotted line\nso as a board-certified plastic surgeon\nif I were to say hey Michelle\num you're pregnant not that you are but\nI'd say hey you're pregnant and I want\nto perform your C-section now I haven't\nseen a C-section since I was in my third\nyear of medical school but if I convince\nyou that I that that hey I'm the guy to\nperform your C-section uh just pay me\nfive thousand dollars cash beforehand\nwe'll do it in my office and all my\noffices great you're gonna love it and\nyou do that and I perform the operation\nthere's no law against me doing that now\nif I botch it you could potentially sue\nme okay but in some states it's hard to\nsue doctors because you really have to\nyou know have evidence of true\nmalpractice and so it can be a very\ndifficult situation\nwow that's actually really enlightening\nI did not know that like a dentist can\nperform a nose job essentially so there\nare scope of practice okay so like if\nyou're a nurse you can't perform a tummy\ntuck like that's a scope of practice\nissue and that would be illegal so there\nare illegal procedures being done in\nhotel rooms and stuff like that\num but we're talking about real doctors\nperforming real operations that they\njust don't have the experience to do\nthat is legal okay as long as a patient\nsigns for it there's nothing illegal\nabout it well people should know that\nthank you for enlightening us on that\nand then um I just wanted to know and\nwhen does the desire for plastic surgery\ncross the line from healthy to dangerous\nsuch as developing body dysmorphia and\nhow does it impact a person's mental\nhealth in your opinion\num I think the first thing I look at is\nwhen we're performing a cosmetic\nprocedure are we truly helping somebody\nlook quote unquote better or are we just\nmaking them look quote unquote different\nnow admittedly that's kind of can be a\nlittle bit of a gray area okay and there\nare some people who say oh I like how\nthis person looked before surgery more\nthan after but I do think that there are\ncertain things that are that are pretty\nstandard okay and so for example if you\nhave somebody who has like I mentioned\nearlier had had three children has skin\noverhanging their you know from their\ntummy they've got rashes underneath it\nand they want a tummy tuck most people\nwould say you know that's probably a\nfairly reasonable cosmetic surgery to\nperform\num on the flip side maybe you have\nsomebody who has a full d-cup chest and\nit's natural and this is the way they\nhave developed and they want to have\nquadruple D's and they come to see you\nfor implants because they want their\nbreasts to look four times bigger\nthat even though it's a cosmetic\noperation even though you're technically\nnot doing anything illegal I would say\nyou know we're not necessarily changing\nthis person to make them look better\nwe're changing them to make them look\njust different and that's where we start\nin my opinion going off the rails so\nadmittedly it's not a black and white\nissue for every single situation but I\ndo think that there are reasonable\nstandards that most of us in society can\nkind of look at and say yeah that sounds\npretty reasonable to me or that doesn't\nsound reasonable at all and just a\ndigression for a second is the show\nbotched actually accurate of like like\nclients that you see or is that just\nlike for TV\num so you know bash is very interesting\nbecause there are certain people on\nbotched that are really out there you\nknow like there's a guy and I just made\na video on it um we haven't aired it yet\nbut uh a guy who basically was uh\ntransforming himself into an elf you\nknow and he wants to have big elf ears\nand get his eyes uh change color and and\nthat's something that is pretty out\nthere you don't see that commonly uh\nwhat I do see commonly are people who\nhave botched surgery that you try to fix\nup for them you know they get surgery\ndone in another country or they get it\ndone by one of these kind of phony\nplastic surgeons and they've got major\nproblems tissue dyes you know they have\nhorrible infections stuff like that that\nis very accurate and actually the\ndoctors on Bosch are very reasonable and\nI would say and I've watched a lot of\nepisodes of it because I do a lot of\nreaction to that on my channel I would\nsay probably I would agree with maybe\nnot 85 to 90 of of what they recommend\nand do\nand they try to promote like ethics in\nplastic surgery I've noticed that\nyes yeah so I think that they're both\nreally really good uh plastic surgeons I\nthink they do great work\num you know every once in a while I have\na technique\num you know a technique where I differ\nyou know what I would specifically do\nbut that doesn't mean that I'm right\nthere wrong there's more than one way to\nperform plastic surgery that's a good\npoint and then how do you think that\nsocial media such as Tick Tock and\nInstagram perpetuate a toxic unrealistic\nbody image which in turn causes people\nto turn to plastic surgery\nyeah I think that there's especially\nwith the short form video nowadays\neverybody wants to go viral and how do\nyou go viral you show something extreme\nokay and so that could be anything from\nsomebody showing their extreme bbls uh\nto doctors who are performing extreme\noperations or trying to make it look so\nfancy and fun and oh you know it's not\neven like surgery at all this is like\ngoing to the spa and that's just BS\nthat's just not true\num and so I think that when you have\nsomething where you know you've got a 30\nor 60 second video it's hard to show\neverything that somebody goes through in\nthat type of a short time uh and on top\nof that you have doctors who their\nulterior motive is to get business and\nso they're not going to talk about\npotential complications they're not\ngoing to talk about implants that might\nmake people sick they're just going to\ntalk about all the Fantastic things that\nthey're doing and oh and you should come\nsee me here's my phone number exactly\nlike what about what do you think of\ntrends like the nose job check what do\nyou think of trends like that do you\nthink that maybe it helps other people\nfeel better about themselves when they\nget a nose job or do you think that it\nmakes people just want to get a nose job\nand they get addicted to it no I think\nthat there's a lot of good things that\ncome about I think in general\ncommunication just as in life I think\nmore communication is always better and\nand so just as a general idea I think\nthe more that we put it out there and\nthe more we share our honest Stories the\nbetter it is I like to see videos not\nthat I would ever want somebody have a\ncomplication but I love it when somebody\ndoes share where they had surgery maybe\nthey weren't happy with it or they're\nbad experience by going going overseas\nor whatever I think those are great as\nlong as they're honest I think that\nwhere we go wrong is when people try to\ngloss over things and it's being\ndishonest and the viewers don't realize\nthat this is a sanitized version or\nsomething that's essentially just a big\ncommercial\nexactly and I mean do you think that in\nyour opinion what kind of crosses the\nline from addiction to just it being a\nnormal procedure is it one surgery is it\ntwo is it ten\nyeah I don't think there's really a\nnumber that is going to be a black and\nwhite I think once again you go back to\nthat thing I said earlier is if you're\nchanging yourself to look quote unquote\nbetter and you know and as Society we\nlook at that go yeah that you know he or\nshe does look better they look better\nthen that's one thing versus oh that\nperson looks different okay uh and so\nlike it's it's like if you have a nose\njob and you have somebody they've got a\na big bump on their nose Okay that\nperson can be beautiful with the bump or\nwithout the bump but we can look and say\nhey the person wants to take the bump\noff they feel like it draws attention to\ntheir face and if they have the bump\nremoved their facial Harmony may look\ndifferent and they are looking forward\nto that okay that's reasonable but if\nthey've had three nose jobs it's just\nnot narrow enough for them and they want\nto look more narrow you know and they\nwant to look like Janet Jackson's nose\nor something like that now we start\ngetting into that issue with dysmorphia\nand geez I feel like we're doing too\nmuch but admittedly there is a bit of a\ngray area there you know and there are\neven celebrities that we may look at and\ngo geez I don't know did that did that\nperson go too far we know those people\nwho definitely went too far we know the\npeople who didn't go too far but there\nare those that are kind of great areas\ntoo\nokay so thank you for that and I just\nwant to move to the audience questions\nsegment so I'm very excited for this\nfirst one we'll start with a\nlight-hearted one we've got Anthony are\nyou single\nno I'm married I've been married yeah\nover 20 years she's a pediatrician right\nyes she is amazing that's amazing okay\nand then next\num\nso someone asked what is harder Dental\nor medical school\nso I can't say anything about dental\nschool because I haven't been to it\num honestly I would think dental school\nin some ways would be harder because I\ncan't imagine like looking into people's\nmouths that much and for me like the one\nthing that really bothers me are bad\nsmells and I can't imagine some of\npeople's breasts that you have to deal\nwith as a dentist that being said\nmedical school is very difficult and and\nreally essentially if you go straight\nthrough from high school to college to\nmedical school you are essentially\ngiving up your 20s it is a lot of hard\nwork it's stressful\num it's worthwhile if you want to be a\nphysician but you have to work so hard\nto to get to that end level you know it\nused to be back 30 40 years ago that\npeople became doctors because they\nthought it was their best way to make\nmoney it is not that way anymore okay\nreally if you want to be a physician you\nwant to do it because you want to help\npeople you you love medicine uh that's a\nreason to do it because it is a long\nhard Road how many hours a week do you\nthink you studied as a medical student\njust as a digression for a second so you\nknow my average day in medical school\nhonestly would be for one of some of the\nharder times you would get up at let's\nsay 6 30 you would have class from let's\nsay seven to noon and then we would take\nan hour break for lunch with study from\nlet's say one to four take an hour break\nfrom four to five study another hour or\ntwo take an hour for dinner then study a\nfew more hours that evening and then\nmaybe watch an hour of TV\nokay wow that's that's intense it's a\nlot of studying now you know admittedly\nI'm one that I needed to study I I know\nthere are some people who they read it\nonce and they remember it forever I'm\nnot that type of person I did very well\nin medical school but I wasn't at the\ntop of my class because I don't have\nthat photographic memory uh so\neverybody's kind of different how they\ndeal with it but it is a lot of work\njust to shout out one of our hosts\nMonica she's actually in medical school\nright now oh wow yeah and she's she's\nsuper smart but I just wanted to put\nthat out there\nand then um a question from Joel hello\nsorry I'm late what's the most important\npart of inner beauty\num I say the most important part of\ninner beauty is how you see yourself\nbecause really there are so many outside\nfactors that can affect how you see\nyourself and you know people can tell\nyou this and tell you that but in the\nend it really comes down to loving\nyourself uh warts and all okay and I\nthink what bothers me the most is that I\nhave patients who come to see me and\nthey say well so and so said I should do\nthis you know my husband said I need a\ntummy tuck you know my best friend said\noh you know you should get a nose job or\nI was dating somebody and he broke up\nwith me because he thought that my\nbreasts were too small I get so upset by\nthat because really I think in the end\nlike\nit's so hard I think in our society feel\ngood about yourself when you have\npictures of Kardashians and and Taylor\nSwift and and people who are just these\nimpossibly Attractive people that are\nall over your your social media feeds\nand and and all that that it's hard to\nfeel good about yourself in some ways\nand for that reason you know I'm I\nreally like certain celebrities like\nlet's say lizzo who promotes body\npositivity because I think we there's\nbeauty in all of us and I think that\nit's it's I feel so bad when there are\npeople who don't feel that there is any\nbeauty to them at all\num so I think that's the most important\nthing you always want to start by loving\nyourself and don't let anybody prevent\nyou from loving yourself you know and we\nall have parts of us that we may not\nlike you know I have a gummy smile that\nI don't like you know I'd love to have\nbigger biceps you know right at the same\ntime like\nnobody's perfect and and really I think\nthe most important thing is to start by\nloving yourself exactly and even\ncelebrities struggle with body image so\nwe're all you know we all struggle with\nit and what you see on TV what you see\nin social media what you see on magazine\ncovers all that's fake it's all fake you\nknow it's all filters it's all\nairbrushing it's it's professional\nmakeup artists you know I've seen\ncelebrities up close and personal where\nyou look at them on TV and you go wow\nthey look so great and I look at them\nlike and I'm three feet away go oh my\ngosh they have so many more wrinkles\nthan I ever thought they did there's so\nmuch smoke and mirrors out there\nabsolutely and you don't really know\nthem right you're just seeing what\nthey're on TV they're on the movie\nscreen but you're not seeing them like\nthis right yeah and the fact is is that\nso many people out there whether they're\ninfluencers or their uh actors or\nactresses their job a lot of times is to\nlook good you know they've got\ndietitians makeup artists personal\ntrainers you know physical therapists\nthey have so many people that are\nhelping them to look really good if we\nhad that type of resources we would all\nlook like them as well\nabsolutely and so Alaska Berry asked how\ndo you know if a plastic surgery surgeon\ncan be trusted or is legitimate\nunfortunately there's not just one thing\nthat you can do but there's a number of\nthings you wanted to do the first thing\nis you want to make sure that the\nperson's a real plastic surgeon so make\nsure that they're a member of the\nAmerican Society of plastic surgeons\nsomething like 98 of real plastic\nsurgeons are members of asps the\nAmerican Society of plastic surgeons\nthey're all board certified so you know\nmember of that Society you know they're\nboard certified but that's not enough\nbecause there are members of asps that\nare not good doctors so once you meet\nwith that doctor and see how that doctor\ntreats you the time the doctor spends in\nconsultation with you will be directly\nproportional and will be indicative of\nthe time they spend with your operation\nand how they treat you during your\noperation if they're really hurried if\nyou're not worth their time that they\nspent three minutes with you or they\nhave their assistance you know talk with\nyou and they barely spend time with you\nyou know they're going to treat you like\nthat in surgery too and that may not be\nhow you want to be treated in the\noperating room so really get an idea and\nthen see more than one doctor you know\nmake sure that if you do decide on\nsomebody that you are 100 certain that\nthat you've got a connection there and\nthat makes a lot of sense to you\nabsolutely and then someone asks why do\npeople who have gone undergone plastic\nsurgery didn't sometimes deny that\nthey've gone through surgery especially\nlike celebrities\nthere's a stigma to plastic surgery it's\nnot nearly like it used to be and I\nreally do credit the Kardashians as ping\nsome of the people who've really brought\nplastic surgery to their Forefront even\nthough they haven't admitted to all the\nstuff that they've done Chloe excuse me\num\nI haven't brought it out there they've\nrevealed that they've had procedures\ndone and I think that's really really\nimportant but still there's a stigma and\na lot of people want to uh hide the fact\nthat they've had something done because\nthey want to be praised sometimes for\nlooking as great as they do because they\napply olive oil to their skin or some BS\nlike that\nabsolutely and Lulu asked Can someone\ndevelop a mental health disorder after\nplastic surgery when they've never had a\nhistory or issues before\nthat's a good question I honestly don't\nknow the answer to that\nI suppose that that's possible because\nsome type sometimes mental issues will\nbe triggered by different life events so\nI suppose if that's possible but I\nwouldn't you know as not being a true\npsychiatrist I can't answer that 100 for\nyou\nthank you for that and then air is asked\na very very good question I think her\nname is pronounced Aries okay do you\nthink it should be mandatory to redirect\na patient to a psychologist before they\nget any kind of plastic surgery\num I don't think that that's reasonable\nuh I feel like with as much work is\ngoing on right now\nI mean and really there's so many mental\nhealth issues out there that\nyou know if you have somebody who really\nis well adjusted and they have a true\nissue\num I don't I think that it would really\noverwhelm mental health\num the mental health practitioners out\nthere if we did something like that you\nknow sometimes I mean some people really\nneed it in those situations a doctor\nshould definitely refer to it but\notherwise I think there's so many other\npeople that need help to kind of clog\nthose alleys with people who may not\nneed it just to try to screen them is\nprobably unnecessary\nabsolutely and then we've got another\nquestion by mia Who diagnoses body\ndysmorphia\nuh typically done by either a plastic\nsurgeon or by a family doctor or a\npsychiatrist best way to think about\nthat and if you're wondering like geez\ndo I have biasmorphia really the way to\nthink about it is it's a an issue with\nyour physical appearance that is out of\nproportion to really reality you know so\nif you say hey I hate my nose I've got\nthis bump on my nose and all of your\nfriends and your parents and everybody\nelse says I can barely see that bump at\nall yet you think that bump is the size\nof Mount Rushmore then that may be a\nsign of dysmorphia you know if you are\nso focused on the cosmic part of of you\nknow of your body and other people don't\nsee why you should be so focused on it\nthen that may be a sign of dysmorphia\nnow there are people who do have real\nissues you know there are people who\nlet's say were born with a cleft lip and\nthey've got you know scarring from their\ncleft lip and they're really sensitive\nabout it you know and they focus on that\nand when they look in the mirror that's\nall they see I wouldn't consider that\ndysmorphia because there there's a\nreason why you know and and it's\nunderstandable but it's when it's not\nunderstandable and other people don't\nget why this is such a focus that could\nbe a potential sign of dysmorphia\nand then Mia asks is there any mental\nhealth assessment done by plastic\nsurgeons and called consultations is\nthat normal or\num there's not anything that we have\nthat standardized like a checklist form\nor anything like that but as plastic\nsurgeons you know when we do our uh\neducation there are lectures that we go\nto that will often say hey these are\nsome of the red flags to look for if\nyou're performing surgery uh this person\nmay not be a good candidate and the\nnumber one red flag usually is\nexpectations that are unrealistic you\nknow whether that's you know they they\nthink that the result is going to be\nperfect or maybe they think having\nplastic surgery is going to change their\nlife to the point where they are very\nunhappy but now they will be happy\num there's a lot of different things but\nreally it's unrealistic expectations are\nalways the number one thing\nabsolutely and then dark Phoenix asked\nwhat are the pros and cons of\nnormalizing plastic surgery\num I think the pros of normalizing\nplastic surgery is that it's being\nperformed anyway and to kind of keep it\nhidden\num can bring shame to people who really\ndon't you know deserve that I think\nthere are a lot of positive things that\ncan happen from plastic surgery with\nimproving people's quality of lives but\nthe negative part of it is that we never\nwant to encourage people to go under the\nknife you know this is something that\nonce again should always be considered\nas a last resort and that's one thing I\nalways share in my videos if you watch\nmy videos you see that that's one of the\nthings I always say is eat real food use\nClean Skin Care and consider plastic\nsurgery as a last resort and normalizing\nit once again more communication is\nalways good but we don't want to make it\nso normal that people think oh it's no\nbig deal I'm just going to go get breast\nimplants or I'm going to go get some\nlipo no big deal well it is a big deal\nmm-hmm and then uh virens asked can\nplastic surgeons plastic surgeons refuse\nto give plastic surgeon surgery I think\nyou mentioned this but yeah I turned\ndown maybe one out of every five or six\npeople that come to see me uh for\nvarious reasons you know whether it's\nunrealistic expectations I'm concerned\nabout body dysmorphia or maybe sometimes\nI just don't feel like the operation\nmakes a lot of sense for them then I\nwill say no\nand then Pat asked or is it cat yes cat\nasked how can we change the way we look\nat ourselves\nI think this really starts from inside\nyourself\num and really I'm a big fan of therapy\nuh and I think therapeutic really get to\nthe root cause of why let's say you have\nself-esteem issues or self-image issues\nthat's always the first place to start\nit's not to start getting Botox\num and so really I think seeking therapy\nuh even just talking to a friend about\nit somebody who's trusted is always\nthose are good places to start there's\nno you know Magic Bullet to this there's\nno key to this it really is going to be\njust dealing I think with uh your\nhistory with your your uh how you grew\nup how you've always felt about yourself\nand and these issues and how all of it\npotentially intertwines\nso someone asked this question I'll just\nlike rephrase it how can one stop you\nknow thinking about one specific body\npart as like\nyou know unattractive over and over\nagain like how can they maybe stop those\nthoughts\num I think that's something that really\nif you do have an obsessive uh if you do\nhave obsessive thoughts about something\nlike this you really need to seek\ntherapy first because there could be an\nunderlying reason why this is something\nthat you focus on you know is it\nsomething that somebody said to you when\nyou were younger you know is it\nsomething that maybe your parents you\nknow kept bringing up with you or\nsiblings or something they're typically\nunderlying reasons why you feel this way\nI mean unless you have a true you know\nbody disfigurement there are reasons to\nthink that way and uh and and trying to\nget to that root cause of where this is\ncoming from I think is the most\nimportant thing and seeking therapy I\nthink is the best way to start\nabsolutely so like essentially like\nassessing where it's stemming from\nexactly I think it you know as I get\nolder you you know you realize that so\nmuch of our insecurities come from\nchildhood and sometimes things that we\nmay not even remember offhand but we've\nkept with us through the years uh as a\nparent myself of two high school kids I\nalways think about like geez like have I\ndone anything over the last you know 16\n18 years that is going to cause\nsomething like that to them you know as\nparents were not perfect uh and so for\nyou being somebody you know think about\nthat and and always consider therapy\nbecause it can only help and I think\nthat's important because sometimes when\npeople are obsessing over a specific\nbody part they automatically assume that\nit is unattractive and it's like well\nthat's not necessarily true other people\nmight find it beautiful like it's not\nnecessarily unattractive and so\nyeah right and this is our last question\nfrom James so plastic surgery which\nwould be a practical reason to get\nplastic surgery\nuh practical reason is if you do have a\ncosmetic concern about your face or your\nbody uh that you feel can be improved\nwith plastic surgery you have the means\nto do it you feel it's worth the\npotential risks then definitely I think\nit's worthwhile to consult with somebody\nbut first you want to talk with yourself\nyou know have a have a very honest\ndiscussion with yourself can you be\nhappy completely happy in your life\nwithout doing this procedure and if the\nanswer is yes then maybe you shouldn't\ndo it other times you know people look\nat it and maybe the rest of the\noperation aren't that high and it may be\nworth taking it on every procedure is\ndifferent and so seeking a good doctor\nthat you trust as well as talking to\nyour family or friends about it those\nare important things you don't just do\nthis on your own and make sure that if\nyou do talk to a doctor make sure that\ndoctor has your best interests in mind\nisn't just trying to make money off of\nyou\nabsolutely well thank you so much for\nbeing here being here today Dr you and\nthis information is so valuable to our\nviewers and again thank you for the\namazing work you do have a great day\neveryone until next time thank you"
