    "transcript": "depending on who you ask being quiet can\nbe both a blessing and a curse there's\nnothing wrong with being quiet but there\nare often certain stereotypes or\nassumptions people make that might not\nbe entirely true not all quiet people\nare introverts but they share similar\ntraits and behaviors\nso whether you feel like you know\nfrighteningly little about your quiet\nfriend or are a quiet person and want to\nknow more here are five psychological\nfacts about quiet people\nif you need to be heard talk to a quiet\nfriend\nwhen opening up to someone you probably\ndon't want that person to make it all\nabout themselves or interrupt and make\nassumptions the ideal listener is\nsomeone who can calmly hear you collect\ntheir thoughts and only give advice when\nit's wanted or needed\nthere's a lot that goes into being a\ngood listener but quiet people have a\nhead start naturally preferring to be\nquiet longer a 2020 study published in\nthe international Journal of listening\nfound that empathetic listening improved\ninterpersonal relationships greatly the\nstudy teaches us that when someone uses\nempathetic listening it boosts our\nsatisfaction and relational quality\nbasically putting the time into\nlistening to someone properly will\nreduce the chance of conflicts coming up\nlater\nanyone can empathetically listen but\nsome might find it more difficult when\ntrying to listen we tend to want to\noffer Solutions and steer the\nconversation's direction the problem is\nthat the person who should be listening\nis trying to control the conversation\nthere should be two roles a speaker and\na listener quiet people are able to put\naside their thoughts and often accept\nthe role of the listener for as long as\nthey have to\nquiet people as Leaders there are\ndefinitely introverted leaders out there\nfilm directors CEOs and Retail managers\ncan all be successful leaders while\nbeing introverts these people are in\nimportant positions and by the nature of\ntheir roles as leaders have to cooperate\nwith people all day every day so how do\nthey manage to lead despite seemingly\nnot having ideal extroverted traits for\nleadership\nit comes down to how they interact with\nthe people they lead as author Carmen\nNobel writes both types of leaders the\nextroverts and the introverts can be\nequally successful or ineffectual but\nwith different groups of employees\nan extroverted leader will take the\nreins and feel comfortable with telling\npeople exactly what is required of them\nand delegating an introverted leader is\nfar more effective when working with\npassionate team members who have their\nown ideas an introverted leader is able\nto understand and fully utilize their\nstrengths and their team strengths this\nis why they're so effective in Creative\nFields like film they're able to get the\nbest out of their team skills\nbeing quiet doesn't equal depressed it's\ntrue that introverts in quiet or\nreclusive people are more likely to be\ndepressed the idea of extroverts being\nextremely happy and introverts being\nless happy is not entirely false but\nmight be a little exaggerated in the\nhandbook of solitude there is a chapter\non introversion Solitude and subjective\nwell-being that examines the differences\nbetween introverts and extroverts with\nregards to happiness extroverted people\ncan try to cope with their depression in\nways that suit them such as going out\noften and constantly being busy with\npeople on the other hand introverts\nmight show more stereotypical signs of\ndepression just by being themselves\nextroverts do tend to be more happy but\naccording to the handbook of solitude\nthat also depends on how you measure\nhappiness\nbeing quiet doesn't make you more\ncreative or intelligent but neither does\nbeing loud\nthe relationship between personality\ntraits creativity and intelligence is a\nsubject that has been investigated quite\nthoroughly if we imagine the kinds of\npeople we think of as intelligent in\nmovies or video games you might think of\nsomeone who is quiet or reserved someone\nwho is always deep in thought and away\nfrom the crowd while this sort of\narchetype definitely can exist in real\nlife it probably isn't the majority\nit should be said that being quiet or\nbeing an introvert doesn't inherently\nmake you more intelligent or more\ncreative\nin her 2007 dissertation psychologist\ntalana nade found that there is a\nrelationship between someone's creative\nability and their intelligence the\ntraits found in a person that is more\ncreative and intelligent were the\nopposite of what you'd expect from the\nstereotypes in movies they found that\nrisk taking playfulness sense of humor\nopenness to new experiences Freedom\nflexibility and originality were all\ncommon amongst the more creative and\nintelligent individuals but these traits\ndon't necessarily describe a loud person\nthey might be more outgoing and have all\nof these traits and still be quiet\nthings such as confidence and positive\nself-image seem to correlate with\ngreater creativity other studies suggest\nthat there is absolutely no correlation\nbetween creativity and personality\ntraits so take it all with a grain of\nsalt\nthey are more self-aware For Better or\nWorse to get a quiet person to talk can\nbe a bit of a tall order sometimes quiet\npeople stay quiet just because of their\nself-awareness\nwhen we're in a casual social setting\nour focus should be on projecting\noutwards and engaging with the people\naround us\nself-awareness is a good thing it keeps\nyou grounded but it comes with downsides\ndo you ever feel like you can't fully\nappreciate a situation because you're\ntoo self-critical or over analyzing at\nparties everyone else seems to be lost\nin conversation having fun and generally\nletting loose but when you have to talk\nyou are still considering every word you\nsay carefully contemplating everything\naround you and just generally feeling\nlike a fly on the wall this can be fun\nto know that you are seeing the bigger\npicture but it can also feel alienating\nBehavior specialist Elaine Warren and\nJames Everett explain that whether your\nself-awareness is helpful or harmful\ndepends on your inner speech or the way\nthat you think if your thoughts are cold\nand harsh and you feel like a recluse in\nsocial situations then maybe your\nself-awareness is taking out all the fun\nwhen you're social but if you enjoy\nbeing quiet around your friends and feel\nat peace while simply existing in the\nsame space then your self-awareness is\nenhancing a situation that as an\nintrovert you might not get a lot of fun\nout of\nso what did we learn about quiet people\nyou can trust them to listen and they\ncan be capable leaders they aren't quiet\nbecause they're depressed they aren't\nmore intelligent just because they're\nquiet but they are more self-aware most\nimportantly don't underestimate quiet\npeople\nif you are a quiet person let us know if\nyou relate to any of these and if you\nhave a quiet friend share this video\nwith them before you go remember to\nleave a like
