    "transcript": "fuzzy blanket 80s ballads blasting and\nempty ice cream pints I think we all\nknow what this means size going through\na breakup if there's one thing that's\ntrue about breakups it's never easy for\nanyone it's ironic as we search for love\nand happiness we focus on uncovering the\nsecrets to a successful marriage the\nsigns a couple is compatible and which\nfactors can best predict their long-term\nhappiness in a relationship to the point\nthat we get tunnel vision\nwhile we weren't paying attention\npsychologists have stumbled upon an\nunusual discovery\nbreakups have unexpected benefits\nresearchers whose work we will be\ntouching upon later can all attest to\nthis even though breaking up is hard to\ndo staying in a relationship that's no\nlonger good for you just might be worse\nso if you're in a relationship and\nwondering if a breakup might be good for\nyou here are six signs that a breakup\nmight be good for you a quick disclaimer\nthough we're not telling or encouraging\nanyone to break up if you're thinking\nabout breaking up with a partner because\nof serious relationship struggles it\nwould be better to talk to a trusted\nfriend or mental health professional\nabout your specific situation alright\nlet's get into it here we go again if\nyou and your partner rehash the same\narguments over and over you might feel\nlike a broken record stuck in a loop on\nGroundhog Day while it's perfectly\nnormal and healthy for couples to get\ninto disagreements from time to time\nrepeating the same argument can be\nunproductive according to a Healthline\narticle from 2019 by Cindy Lamont this\nis a Telltale sign that it's time to\nbreak up repeating the same arguments\nmeans that you've already reached an\nimpasse in your relationship there are\ncertain things you just cannot agree to\ndisagree on or refuse to compromise\nmaybe this thing is something important\nto you both maybe not if you feel that\nyou and your partner aren't compatible\nin your views and values this may be a\nsign that a breakup could be good for\nyou\nthat's not what I want for our\nrelationship to stand the test of time\nyou and your partner need to have a\nshared idea of your future together and\nmutually agree upon goals that speak to\nyour core values as a couple the moment\nthese goals become misaligned then it's\ndefinitely going to cause a rift between\nyou two sometimes the two ideas may be\ntotally different but other times it can\neven look like your partner deciding\ntheir goals are more important forcing\nyou to put your ideas on hold and\naccording to a 2014 study about breakup\nbenefits having a greater sense of\nself-direction is one of the benefits of\nbreaking up with someone so if you're\nfeeling like there's no room for you and\nyour beliefs and goals in your\nrelationship it might be time for a\nbreakup to allow you time to flourish\nI'm fine\nas with any relationship romantic or\nplatonic the emotional needs of both\nparties involved need to be met to feel\nsatisfied by the relationship these\nneeds can be quality time affection\nAssurance Mutual trust respect you get\nit so if you're in a relationship where\nyour needs are no longer being met then\na breakup might be good for you if you\nstay in a relationship where your needs\naren't met it's possible that you may\nbegin to ignore your own needs or resent\nyour partner for ignoring them as was\nshown in one study by Stack hurt and\nbersic emotional distance\nwhile your whole world certainly doesn't\nneed to revolve around your significant\nother for it to be considered a loving\nand healthy relationship you do need to\nhave a certain amount of emotional\ncloseness and intimacy with one another\nas studies like Abdul kalaks have\npointed out the greater the emotional\nIntimacy in the relationship the better\nthe couple's quality of life and\npsychological adjustment\nyou've noticed yourself growing closer\nto other people and wanting to spend\nmore time with them instead of your\npartner then there's a good chance that\nthe two of you have already drifted\napart let's say you and your friends are\nout for a night on the town celebrating\nsomeone's recent promotion when it's\ntime to go home are you happy to go home\nto your significant other or do you try\nto convince the group to grab some food\nbefore calling it a night what about\nafter work do you run errands or make\nplans to avoid going home\nthis could be a sign that it's time to\nbreak up the light switch relationship\nlike we said before breakups suck being\nin an on-again off-again relationship\ncan just keep that pain coming back\naround and around think like Ross and\nRachel every time they broke up they\nwere sad telling the other friends how\nthey missed each other and even more\njealous of new partners now there's\nnothing wrong with finding love with the\nsame person the second time around\nremember even Ross and Rachel ended up\ntogether but there are differences\nbetween TV and real life when you're in\na true on-again off-again situation it\ncan be confusing and emotionally\ndraining both parties involved when you\ngo back to the on-again phase this might\nbe done out of loneliness and a desire\nfor something familiar according to a\n2009 study by Melissa Ramsey Miller in\ninstances like this it's ultimately\nbetter to let them go and move on\nyourself than to keep you both trapped\nin this unhealthy cycle and are you\nbetter with or without does your sense\nof obligation to your partner keep you\nfrom chasing certain dreams or limit the\nopportunities you allow yourself to\npursue do you feel that certain opinions\nor beliefs between you and your partner\nClash so you minimize them to avoid\nconflicts do you get the sense that your\npersonalities don't complement each\nother well this can be a difficult thing\nto admit but you owe it to yourself to\nbe honest if you answered yes to any of\nthese questions it might be worth\nthinking about what it may be like if\nyou weren't with them anymore studies as\nthe ones by Alicia Franklin in 2015 and\nthe 2013 study led by Thai tashiro\nshowed that there are considerable\nbenefits to breaking up like the ones\nwe've discussed here while it's never\neasy to let go of someone you love and\nand a once happy relationship the truth\nis that sometimes people grow apart and\nour paths can take us in different\ndirections in life as the famous Marilyn\nMonroe quote goes\nThings Fall Apart so better things can\nfall together ultimately even the\nheartbreaking end of a relationship can\nlead to a lot of beautiful personal\ngrowth and self-discovery are there any\nother signs that you know of that could\nmean a breakup may be good for you let\nus know in the comments below see you\nnext time"
