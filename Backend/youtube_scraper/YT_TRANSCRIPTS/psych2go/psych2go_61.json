    "transcript": "- How many of us have anxiously paced back\nand forth wondering, do they think of me\nor do they even know I exist?\nIt can be frustrating and confusing\nto wonder whether your\ncurrent romantic interest is\nthinking of you or not.\nAlthough there is no\nguaranteed way of knowing\nwhat someone else is thinking.\nThere are several signs you\ncan look out for that indicate\nthat you're on their mind too.\nSo let's get into it.\nOpen body language as the saying goes,\nthe body never lies when you're\naround your crushing person.\nDo they subtly lean towards you?\nDo they raise their eyebrows\nwhen they're speaking to you?\nDo you notice that their\nbody is positioned in your\ndirection such as having their\nfeet pointed towards you?\nThese are just a few examples of\nhow body language not only\nhelps indicate whether\nor not someone is thinking of you,\nbut can also be a major sign\nof attraction bonus points\nif they lick their lips.\nI'm just kidding. But seriously,\nnonverbal communication is a\npowerful way of understanding\nhow others feel about us\nduring an interaction.\nConscious and unconscious\nbody language can give you\nimportant insight about\nsomeone's emotional state,\nand if your crush is seemingly\nexhibiting several different\npositive body language cues\nwhen they're around you, then\nthey might just be thinking about you.\nWhen you are not around\nanxiety, you see your crush\nand you notice their face is flushed,\nthey're fidgeting their hands,\nand they felt up nervous laughter every\ntime you're both in the same room.\nCould this be a coincidence? Maybe.\nBut it's very possible\nthat they might be thinking\nabout you constantly\nand they don't know what to do\nwith themselves when\nthey see you in person.\nAccording to research conducted\nby PhD Susan B. Hughes,\nprofessor of Psychology\nat Albright College,\nthere is a strong correlation\nbetween nervous behavior and attraction.\nThe experiment was intended\nto measure the psychological\nvocal and behavioral reactions\nand differences displayed\nby participants when meeting an attractive\npotential romantic partner.\nAfter the interactions,\nthe participants in the study\ndisplayed similar nervous\nbehavioral patterns such as\nblushing, increased heart rate,\nawkward staring, and\ntrouble concentrating.\nSo next time you see your crush, a nervous\nand flustered reaction from\nthem could be a major sign\nthat they're secretly thinking about you\nand you are not around\norbiting your social media.\nYou just posted a new story or\npost on your Instagram page,\nand guess who pops up on your feed?\nYour crush. Has this happened to you?\nIf you constantly notice\nthat your crush is always the first person\nto view your stories\nor like one of your posts on social media,\nthen you are probably running\nthrough their mind day and night.\nYou are inevitably going\nto pop up in their head if\nthey're always seeing your quirky\npics and videos on\ntheir social media feed.\nBut if they're going\noutta their way to view\nor like your stories,\nthen they're most likely\nthinking about you constantly\naccording to relationship expert\nand founder of Love\nStrategies, Adam La Dolce.\nIf someone is constantly\nshowing up on her feed\nand paying attention to your\nevery move on social media,\nthen they're not only thinking of you,\nbut they might even have\na crush on you as well,\nespecially if they're initiating\n- Eye contact.\nDo you catch or crush staring\nat you from a distance\nor shooting you a quick\nglance every time you walk by?\nThis sign is similar to the\nbody language sign mentioned\nearlier, but it's extremely\nimportant to pay attention\nto on its own relationship.\nCoach and author Matt Boggs emphasizes\nthat prolonged eye contact\nfrom a potential love interest\nmeans that they may be zoning out\nand thinking of how\nattracted they are to you,\nespecially if it's during a conversation.\nBos also mentions that\nyou should pay attention\nto a person's eyebrows\nwhen interacting with them.\nIf they raise their eyebrows\nand smile when seeing you,\nthen they're probably thinking of you.\nSo when you guys think, have any\nof you noticed these behaviors\nfrom your crush, let us know\nand remember, you matter.\nThanks for watching and see you next time."
