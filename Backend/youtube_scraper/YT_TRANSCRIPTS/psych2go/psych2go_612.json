    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Amanda Silvera\nAmanda is a singer and voice actress\nwith over 10 years of experience and the\nBeloved voice of psych2go Amanda has\nbeen an integral part of psych2go for\nover five years and blessing us with her\nsoothing voice and spreading the word on\nMental Health Awareness welcome Amanda\nthank you for joining us today what an\namazing intro you're so good at this oh\nmy God you're amazing at what you do\ngirl\nbless thank you so much\nso just for starters can you tell us a\nlittle bit about yourself and your\nbackground\num about myself so my name is Amanda\nSilvera I am one of the narrators for\npsych2go uh my pronouns are she her this\nis Peter pancakes my dog back here\num so cute yeah he's a he's a rescue he\nis a little bit insane but um the best\nnonetheless\num as far as background goes I don't\nknow where do I go I'm first generation\nCanadian my parents are Jamaican\num so that's fun I don't know what do\nyou want to know ask me questions\num so just for starters\num what inspired you to go into like\nvoice acting and even singing\nuh so for singing that was never a\nchoice that just kind of like started as\nsoon as I could make noise I was I was\nthinking and it was like a\nit's one of my favorite like forms of\ntherapy to this day it just it just\nmakes things feel better\num but voice acting and narrating was\nsuper random and unplanned and really\ncool because like I believe in\nmanifestation and I was always like the\nvision was that I got to work with a\nmicrophone and work with my voice\num music ended up kind of being\nsomething just for me I mean I still\nshare it but it's not like I'm not\ntrying to like be a big Superstar or\nanything it's just it's all just like\nfrom the heart and for fun\num\nbut I still get to make a living with my\nvoice and with my microphone doing\nnarration but the way it came was\nliterally through like a Craigslist post\nthrough psych to go in the very\nbeginning they were just looking for\nvoice actors and I was like hey can I\ntry\nwas this in 2017\nI mean maybe it was a long it feels like\nit was a million years ago everything\nbefore covet though feels like a million\nyears ago\nbut yeah I think 2017 sounds about right\nall right okay and then um so I love\nyour actual your music covers I think I\nheard them before I even was with\npsych2go I love like um the singing I\nwish they would bring that back I'm not\nsure if they I think it's been a while\nbut they haven't done like the singing\nin a minute I think that we could bring\nthat back it's kind of like a lot of the\ntime I would um I would just do a cover\nand I'd be like hey like how do you feel\nabout this can we share it so I think\nit's kind of on me to get back into it\nand I think that they'd probably be\nhappy to share but we'll see that's\nawesome let's do it soon and then what\ndo you think of psych2go's Legacy what\ndo you think the site what do you think\nthe legacy is and what is the impact you\nfeel they've made for mental health\nawareness\nLegacy what um\nwhat a big word\num\nI think one of the\none of the most beautiful things about\nhaving site to go\nis that you have this way of\ncommunicating for yourself like you can\njust kind of share a video when you're\nunable\noops technical difficulties guys sorry\nabout that all right I'm sorry no\nproblem weird it was a call coming in I\nthat shouldn't happen\num but yeah it gives you the ability to\ncommunicate\num when you maybe can't find the words\nor during you know stressful or\nvulnerable\num moments you can just be like hey hey\nfriend hey Mom hey Dad hey whoever hey\nWorld\num this is kind of how I'm feeling but\nthen also the the community in the chat\nthe validation that that brings to find\nother people that feel the same way as\nyou or relate to you you just suddenly\nyou don't feel so much like an alien and\nthese videos will be there forever so\nwe'll always have that and I think that\nthat is that is the Legacy it's just\nit's brought people together it's made\nconversating about difficult things not\nso what's the word stigmatized exactly\nyeah yeah\nyeah\nso it's sort of like psych2go is has\nmade it so that people are more\ncomfortable to talk about like mental\nhealth topics especially on YouTube and\nthe internet yes\nyeah\nand that's huge that's everything we're\nall like every single one of us we have\nLife Is Life is Hard existing is hard\nand\nit was it was just kind of not a thing\nto talk about\nthose deeper things and so so many\npeople just thought they were\nthey were alone and that maybe they were\nbroken or something was wrong with them\nand it's like\nso many of us are going through the same\nthing in our own way\nand safe to go makes it so that we you\nknow we know absolutely I agree it's\nlike psych2go has brought this community\ntogether and people feel more\ncomfortable and can like speak out I\nthink it's inspired other content\ncreators for sure like psycho is a\nPioneer for sure because they've been\naround since like 2014. yeah I've\ndefinitely seen some like you know\nsimilar similar versions\num but there's no there's no replacing\nsite to go yeah they're psych2go will be\nimmoral your voice will be immortalized\nlike isn't that crazy like a hundred\nyears from now people are going to be\nlistening to you you think I don't know\nI mean I mean yeah what's crazy to me is\nlike 11 million subscribers at this\npoint that's like 22 million years like\nwhat the heck like what the heck it's\nalmost scary it's like I gotta protect\nthis thing\nit's like gold right\nI mean I've your word's not mine\nthough but I mean I just think that is\npretty amazing I think like in the\nhistory of YouTube years from now we're\ngonna be like decades from now people\nwill be learning about psych to go in\nschool I hope I hope yeah yeah I love\nthe way that they did it too like with\nthe the cartoons and making sure that\nthe the voice is matched up and and just\neverything is aligned in a way that just\nmakes it so digestible you know and we\nhit on topics that like\noh sometimes we almost shouldn't get\naway with but we do because we do it\nwith respect and we do it thoughtfully\nand with love and you know yeah and\npsych2go really is a creative team of\nanimators script writers you like the\nexecutive team behind everything it's\nlike amazing it's this huge amazing\ntalented team it's yeah and that's the\nother thing that makes like to go\njust its own thing is the team and how\nmuch everyone involved cares and there\nis so much that goes on behind the\nscenes you know that's that's not the\ncase for all YouTube channels that\ndefinitely isn't used for for the\nmajority of YouTube channels but like\nthis is a whole production\num yeah\nyeah\nand we're always trying to bring up the\nbest topics and we're always listening\nto our viewers to see what they want to\ndo you know what they want to see next\nso definitely yeah and moving on to a\nsimilar point so what's one of your\nfavorite videos that you worked on\nI don't know I was just like\n[Laughter]\nwhen I look at my Google Drive and I\njust like scroll through all of the\nfreaking voiceovers that I've done like\nit's crazy but I genuinely I really\nenjoy so many of them I guess the ones\nthat really hit home for me are some of\nmy favorites\num\nyou know dealing with a trauma healing\nneuroplasticity like I'm such a nerd I\nlove the brain and I think that there's\nso much\num there's so much power and just like\ntaking back your autonomy and really\njust understanding how the brain works\nwhy it's doing what it's doing and um\nwhere how am I here how did I get here\nwhy am I saying this where did we start\nyeah\nno that's that's definitely true it's\njust it's a lot yeah oh right you asked\nme what my favorite one was\num right uh there were a few where I got\nto like like mess with my voice a little\nbit and like put effects on my voice and\nlike play the role of Psy and stuff like\nthat that was those are those are always\nreally fun just kind of outside of the\nbox recording\nthank you hedendrick um he just donated\nand he just um he just uh wrote a super\nsweet comment I just wanted to put it on\nthe\non the main chat glad I'm subscribed to\nyour channel I've taken your advice\nregarding battling depression to make me\na better person can't recall if you've\nmade a video about curbing a temper I'm\nnot sure if we have but thank you\nHendrick that's really sweet of you her\nbeing a temper that would be if that\nwould be it would be great yeah yeah for\nsure thank you Hendrick and\nprops to you for fighting the good fight\nright\nand so what's one of your so I asked\nthat already and so what topics or\nproducts would you like to see psych to\ngo cover in the future and that includes\nask an expert Advocate you know how we\nhave like guests on different like\ndoctor psychologists anything that you\nwant to see in the future\nI want to see us talk to Andrew huberman\nfor one uh yes yeah yeah\num he was the first person that I saw\ntalk about the physiological sigh and we\ndid a few little um videos on our\nChannel about that but it's just such a\npowerful tool and he has all of these\nlike these protocols and tools that you\ncan carry with you for the rest of your\nlife that just\nmake things better and it's not like\njust do this it's do this because this\nhappens and then this happens and you\nknow it just explains\nthere he gives you the he gives you the\ninformation that you need in order for\nit to make sense and click so that\nyou'll keep doing it a lot of the time I\nthink that we get tools but\ndo we stick to them not usually\nyes and so with that being said let's\nmove over to the audience questions hey\nguys okay\nso\nlet's start so profit asks when are you\ngoing to do cooking videos like videos\non like recipes and food\nwhen am I gonna that's assuming I want\nto if or when\nour home is so respectful\num yeah it's definitely gonna happen I\nlove cooking that's that is definitely\nlike up there with with singing and all\nthe other forms of art it's like it's\npainting with food and it's it's food\nthat then goes inside of somebody which\nis like\nkind of you know it's beautiful\nso it'll happen it's just like it's a\nbig process\nmaking my own videos on my channel like\nit's a whole thing\nwhich by the way are linked in the\ndescription uh you can find Amanda's\nYouTube channel in IG\noh thank you yeah yeah come to my come\nvisit come say hi\nthank you Ray so Ray said thanks for\ndoing this not in your comfort zone\nseeing the voice behind these videos\nprovides a nice perspective as well and\nhe donated so thank you Ray thank you\nRay\nI would love to do like a cooking with\npsych to go that would actually be\nreally cute if we could get like a\nlittle studio for it like just you know\nhow like you did the music maybe having\nlike videos of cooking just like to like\nfor people to relax de-stress I mean\nyeah but also like food is food is a\nmajor it plays a major role in mental\nhealth as well yes absolutely for doing\nrecipes that could support could support\nour brain health would actually be\npretty cool that's that's a really good\nidea definitely and Scholastic asks\nbecause I think the viewers really want\nto get to know you on a personal level\nso he asked what are your hobbies my\nhobbies\num cooking I yeah cooking I I love\nnature so much I am quite the like\nloner I I really really like my alone\ntime\num\nespecially in nature so this time of\nyear spring and summer I just I just\nlike to be wherever it's green and\nwherever there are not not too many\npeople\nno I definitely I love nature too I like\nto write poetry about like nature it's\njust amazing you know God's gift to the\nEarth\nwrite some poetry and I'll read it oh\nawesome\nare you I mean you're a pretty cool\nvoice too you can do it yourself thank\nyou it's not soothing though it's a\nlittle bit like I don't know but\nwe all have our flavors\nright thank you wealth building Journey\nfor that donation and then someone asked\nJulian asked has Amanda ever done ASMR\nvideos her voice is so relaxing this has\nbeen a request from the very beginning\nASMR videos freak me out they're just so\nclose I feel like\nI don't want to be one of these people\nbut like I'm highly sensitive and it's\njust so much so I've tried I tried one\ntime to do ASMR and\num the microphone wasn't on the whole\ntime\nso I was just like on camera like up\nclose to this microphone that wasn't on\nfor like a long a long time it was\nit's up I posted it nonetheless because\nit was actually pretty funny but\nmaybe I'll try again I need suggestions\nthough like do I just do I just talk do\nI what do I do what do you want me to do\nyeah I didn't um yeah I think that like\nmaybe doing like this the noises you\nknow like what people\nsome of them some of them are really\ncool though I can see like when you know\nwhen you're in the mood the mood for it\nlike when you the ones that are like in\ncharacter like I think I saw like a\nflight attendant one\nit takes you away I get it I get the\nappeal\nI'll try maybe no promises\nso yes I agree though trying to find a\nfew more and then\num let's see\noh I just wanted to show this comment of\nJustin thank you for everything you\nsaved me from uh suicide and help me\nwith so many other things thank you\nJustin we love you we love you so much\nyeah wow\nso proud of you\nsomeone wrote\nlet me see the name Ken wrote do you\nthink you might write a book for mental\nhealth I could definitely see you making\none that's a good question\nuh\nuh um I might read a book about like\nlike my life like it's pretty juicy\nthere's a lot of a lot of tea working in\nthe other industry and you live and you\nlearn so maybe I could share personal\nexperiences but I'm not a professional\nso\nas far as like a book on mental I'd have\nto probably go educate myself like\nsubstantially before doing anything like\nthat but a book I could see a book\nhappening one day\nin general\na book in general that would be awesome\nit seems like a lot though\nI can barely read sometimes just\nfocusing you know\nand then wield us psycho has helped me\nfeel better about being an introvert how\ndid you find your voice\nI I was born with it\num\nactually I think that the reason why my\nvoice might be like my habits appeal or\nmight be soothing\nis because of being an introvert and\nbecause I was always I've always had a\nfear of I'm working on it and actually\nit's it's not the same as it was but\nI've always had a fear of making making\ntoo much noise\num I've always been so conscious of\neveryone around me I never wanted to\ndisturb anyone living in an apartment I\ndon't want to disturb my neighbors I've\nalways been a very soft-spoken and quiet\nperson and that's not always a good\nthing\num you definitely need to stand your\nground and um and and make space and\nhold your space but\nbecause I'm just always so conscious\nabout like\nother people\num\nI've my voice is just that's what it is\nit's it's soft because I don't wanna I\ndon't wanna be abrasive I don't want to\nhurt your ears I don't want to hurt\nanybody in any way\nand by the way that's rare like just\nthat softness and kindness you don't see\nthat a lot most people think they have\nto be like super abrasive so it's a\nbreath of fresh air definitely I always\nwanted that though I always wanted to be\nthat person I'm surrounded by people\nthat are like that and I'm like why\ncan't why can't I be that but you know I\nlove me I love me more and more each day\nwe love you too\nand then not ask and thank you for the\ndonation by the way it's always nice to\nsee you Amanda I'm glad to see you and\nMr Peter pancakes too how is the trees\nsaved going will you be doing any more\nreadings of any books personally I miss\nthe stories I'm proud of you Amanda\nthat's so sweet oh my gosh\num where do can you read that again\nwhere do I start\num I'll start with the questions um how\nis the tree you saved going will you be\ndoing any more readings of any books\npersonally I miss your stories oh my\ngosh okay so the tree is doing\nphenomenal I went there's this tree that\nwas falling over a couple years ago and\nI just like I brought everyone on the on\nthe ride trying to like get it to stand\nup and then make sure it stayed stood up\nand then make sure it didn't die and it\ndidn't die and it's um it's sprouting\nnow there's like New Growth so that's\namazing wow I love that yeah it's\nbeautiful\num\nand then the stories I don't know man I\ntried I tried really hard there it's\nstill up and available on my channel I\ndon't know for how long it's so\nembarrassing I tried to do like all the\ndifferent characters with their own\nvoices males old ladies\num all also British\nso they all had accents they all have\naccents you can still go and watch and\nlisten but um\nI don't know how long they're gonna stay\nup so so do it quick if I'm gonna do it\ndo I think I'll do it again\nI mean if it's maybe if it was like a\npaid a paid job\notherwise I don't know I'm not great at\nit\nEvan said you will probably not read\nthis but thanks for everything we read\nit Evan Evan\nokay and then\nlet me I think we're gonna do two more\nquestions so\num Elijah asked could you see yourself\nmaking a film on depression and how to\ncope with it\nyeah yeah I've made quite a few already\nif you come over to my channel\num\nI do a lot of like random rambles that\ncall them and random readings sometimes\nthe so what the readings are as I'm\nreading like literal journal entries\njust sharing them out I'm like literally\nan open book\num but I make like little short films\njust about the journey and about the ups\nand the downs and you know it's not\nlinear we all we all have our own\nversions of it but there are also\nsimilarities that we can all relate to\nso\num and I add music and stuff I try to\njust make it really soothing because\nslight The World Isn't So I try to just\nmake it a place where it is so come\ncheck it out I'll be making more for\nsure also I just wanted to share this\namazing comment by Ken he said my school\nactually put on psych to go multiple\ntimes in my classrooms I felt so happy\nwhen they put it on that's amazing wow\noh my God\nI love that that's so cool that makes my\nheart like do things\nwe're in schools wow we definitely I I\npretty much I couldn't guarantee we\nprobably are but now we're confirmed\nright\nyeah yeah that's but that's perfect like\nthat's where it belongs\nyou know exactly it's educational but\nentertaining and so then one more\nquestion by Pilot Amanda what\nmbbti personality are you\nuh I\nI always forget and I've actually seen\nlike websites or like chat threads where\npeople discuss what my MB\nT TI type is and um yeah so you guys\nknow better than I do maybe someone in\nthe chat can let let you know but I\nalways forget\num I remember what she looks like it's\nlike one of the little pixie ones and\nshe's like green\nI don't know I I always forget I don't\nknow\nwell thank you so much Amanda this was\namazing we love having you on like\npeople were already talking about the\nlive stream before it even happened like\nI want to see her she's beautiful I love\nher voice so thank you we appreciate you\nso much thank you you're amazing thank\nyou so much I love you all like deeply I\nhope you can hear it in all the\nvoiceovers I try to fill them with as\nmuch love as I can\nand honestly\num it's important to have these types of\nconversations and answer audience\nquestions because it's mental health\nawareness month so we always need to do\nit but especially during the month of\nMay always\nyes indeed\nso it's great that we did as we wrapped\nup the
