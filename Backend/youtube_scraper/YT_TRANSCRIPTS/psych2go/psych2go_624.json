self-embarrassing\nevents and failure the cognitive\ndissonance theory gives a logical\nexplanation about why we're so quick to\nact upon our negative self-beliefs\nhumans like consistency your behaviors\nusually align with your thoughts and\nvalues so you adopt your behaviors to\nmatch with what you subconsciously\nbelieve to be real about yourselves in\nother words when you feel like a failure\nyou'll go above and beyond to\ndemonstrate to yourself that you were\nright from the get-go you tried to\nprovoke a similar response from people\naround you thus validating your core\nbelief Puppet Master\nwhat happens when you're overly\nconcerned about a writing assignment\ngiven by your professor believing that\nyou may not get the grade you expected\nin your heart you know choosing to stay\nout all night rather than writing the\nassignment isn't a good plan at all but\nat least when you're the captain of the\nship sinking into the deep sea knowingly\nfeels more manageable and hurts less\nthan when it happens unexpectedly\npsychologist George S Everly explained\nthat procrastination and excessive\ndesire for control are usually driven by\nfear of failure when you are overly\nanxious about failing your chances of\nachieving your goals are reduced even\nmore so your road to success is\npurposefully filled with self-made\nroadblocks you may claim that you tried\nyour

credit\nour success on our values and our\ndefeats on external circumstances\nself-handicapping is an ego protection\nmechanism that protects our self-esteem\nfrom our weaknesses\nimposter Among Us have you ever believed\nthat you didn't earn your position\nregardless of your various accolades and\naccomplishments do you subconsciously\nfeel that you are an utter fraud and\nthat your

together\nlicensed clinical psychologist Dr\nMelanie Greenberg explains that one\nreason we self-sabotage is due to the\nfamiliarity heuristic our brains are\nnaturally wired to hold on to the\nfamiliar exaggerate danger and avoid\nattempting new methods we overvalue what\nwe already know and undervalue what is\nnovel stress causes us to depend even\nmore on this familiarity heuristic this\nis why we fall back on Old routines and\nmethods of accomplishing things under\nduress even if they're ineffective we're\ntempted to the known and familiar a\nstudy conducted by Stanford University\nresearchers examined this phenomenon by\nhaving one group of participants solve\ndifficult word puzzles under time\nconstraints and the other group to take\ntheir time upon completion respondents\nwere asked to choose between a long\nproposal created by the same Creator or\na short puzzle created by someone\nunfamiliar the longer puzzle was more\nappealing to those working under the\nstressful condition of constrained time\ntheir brains were jumbled when weighing\nlength against familiarity such that\nthey ended up succumbing to the\nfamiliarity heuristic relationship\ntrauma\nhave you ever become uneasy once you\nfeel a certain degree of closeness to\nyour significant other do you often feel\nthat as much as you desire love and\naffection you also fear rejection if you\nget too close eventually you sabotage\nyour own Relationships by pushing people\naway\naccording to Dr Greenberg unconscious\nself-sabotaging behaviors include\npicking fights micromanaging or becoming\ntoo clingy and needy which stem from\nearly interactions with your Caregivers\nfor example if your early caregivers\ndemonstrated rejection or were\ninconsistent in showing you emotional\nsupport you might develop an insecure\nattachment style as an aftermath of\nexperiencing this pain in your childhood\nyou avoid forming relationships that may\nleave you vulnerable to
