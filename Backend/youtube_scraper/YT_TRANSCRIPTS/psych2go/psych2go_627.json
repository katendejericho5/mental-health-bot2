foods are known as\npsychobiotic diet which can reduce the\nparticipants perceived stress levels and\nenhance the quality of sleep the gut\nbrain axis is important when managing\nstress when it's unbalanced it impedes\nour ability to deal with stress\neffectively a psychobiotic diet supports\nthe production of healthy gut microbiome\nwhich produces serotonin this is a\nprecursor hormone for a melatonin that\nregulates our 24-hour internal clock and\ncircadian rhythm brain development\nif you think that children moving from\ntheir classroom to home is super fast\nthe rate of their brain development is\njust as fast\nnutrition has been described as one of\nthe single most important environmental\nfactors on newborns during pregnancy and\nit continues to be important throughout\ninfancy and the formative years of child\ndevelopment according to researchers\nLisa Sanders and Stephen ziesel Colleen\nplays a vital role in the development of\nthe brain during pregnancy where it may\ninfluence the closure of the neural tube\nand contribute to lifelong memory and\nlearning\nthere was also a study investigating the\nhealth benefits of tacosa hexonic acid\nDHA which is present in mother's milk\nand fatty fish like salmon tuna and\nmackerel the high amount of this fatty\nacid that accumulates in the brain\nduring infancy is associated with better\ndevelopment of language cognition social\nand motor skills is the infant\ntransitions into childhood\nMediterranean diet\nGreece Italy Morocco\nSpain what do these countries have in\ncommon well all these countries border\nthe Mediterranean Sea which\npredominantly follows the Mediterranean\ndiet consisting of an adequate intake of\nfruits nuts vegetables cereals legumes\nand fish

is the primary source\nof omega-3 fatty acids\nomega-3 fatty acids are long-chain\npolyunsaturated fatty acids that cannot\nbe synthesized in the human body and\nmust be acquired through diet a\nrandomized control trial conducted by\nresearcher Jessica Bayes and colleagues\nat the University of Technology Sydney\nhas proven that a Mediterranean diet May\nalleviate symptoms in young men living\nwith moderate to severe depressions\nparticipants consisted of 72 young men\nbetween the ages of 18 to 25 and they\nwere randomly allocated to either a\nMediterranean diet support group or
