    "transcript": "The Dilemma of the sexless relationship\nis the Tale As Old As Time it'd be great\nif sex was the romanticized version we\nsee in movies but that often doesn't\naccurately reflect reality in fact you\nmay not even have an active sex life\nanymore despite being in a committed\nrelationship you will go through phases\nin your sex life where you may have less\nsex or may just put your sex life on\npause temporarily this can be healthy if\nit's a mutual decision however if you're\nin a relationship where your sexual\nneeds aren't being met and there isn't\nroom for compromise this can cause some\nside effects in all areas of your life\nhere are some signs your sex-starved\nrelationship may be hurting you your\nconfidence has taken a hit if your\npartner is always thinking a quick kiss\nor telling you how sexy you are you\nmight feel like a god or goddess but if\nyour relationship is entirely devoid of\nsex you're naturally going to feel less\nsexually attractive and desirable which\ncould cause you to feel less confident\noverall this could manifest in the form\nof negative self-talk and intrusive\nthoughts that can severely diminish your\nself-esteem if you notice that your\nconfidence is taken a hit it may be time\nto talk to your partner about the\ninsecurities you're having over the lack\nof sex in your relationship being open\nand honest about your feelings could\nhelp Revitalize your relationship and\npotentially help revive your sex life\nremember be kind to yourself your value\nisn't measured by your sex life or lack\nthereof you're always value when you\nlearn to Value yourself\nis the grass greener okay go with me on\nthis if you don't have food at home what\nhappens yup ubereats happens or you go\nout to eat well if you're not having sex\nat home naturally you might start to\nwonder if something or someone else can\nfulfill those needs unfortunately that\nis not common as a matter of fact\nseveral studies have referenced a lack\nof sex as a risk factor for Cheating in\na committed relationship for example\nMichelle Davis LCSW relationship\ntherapist and expert noted that at least\none in three couples struggle with\nissues in their sex life which she\nrefers to as the sexual desire Gap Davis\nexplains how couples will even feel\ntempted to cheat on one another out of\nRevenge specifically to get back at the\npartner who is withholding sex lack of\nsex in a relationship is never an excuse\nto cheat we also want to mention that\nlack of sex also doesn't mean you will\n100 cheat but if it's time it's always\nbetter to break things off with your\ncurrent partner before you decide to get\nintimate with someone else\nresentment towards your partner\nresentment towards your partner can\ncreep up in sneaky waves like snapping\nat your partner over the tiniest thing\nthat thing may not even be related to\nyour sex life but deep down you're angry\nand feeling rejected this is called\nprojection and usually happens when\nyou're not addressing the root cause in\nthis case that would be the lack of\nintimacy resentment can be\ncounterproductive since they may not\nunderstand where your frustration is\nstemming from they may think you're\nreally angry that they put the juice on\nthe wrong shelf as we said earlier\ntalking about the issues openly with\nyour partner is usually the best\nsolution but if you've addressed the\nissue and nothing is changing it may be\ntime to reevaluate your relationship\nyou're feeling envious if you find\nyourself constantly comparing your sex\nlife to others do you feel consumed by\nfeelings of jealousy or anger anytime\nyou see or hear stories about other\npeople being affectionate if that's the\ncase you might be feeling envious\nbecause you're unfulfilled by your sex\nlife seeing other relationships that\nseem happy on the outside can be a\npainful reminder of that even if someone\nelse's sex life appears perfect what you\nperceive doesn't necessarily reflect\nreality everyone goes through issues in\ntheir sex life and relationships even if\nyou don't see it Envy is a silent killer\nwho can whisper easy to believe lies to\nyou there are millions and billions of\npeople there will always be someone\nbetter and someone worse than everything\ninstead of comparing talk to your\npartner or a mental health professional\nto help figure out how you can fix the\nissues that are stopping you from having\na fulfilling sex life with your partner\ndepression or lack of motivation have\nyou lost interest in things you used to\nenjoy doing have you noticed intense and\nsudden mood changes if you answered yes\nto honor both of these questions then\nthis might signify the lack of sex is\nimpacting your mental health once you do\nthis you can effectively address the\nissue with your partner and express your\nfeelings you should communicate to your\npartner how a lack of sex and the\nrelationship has impacted you according\nto Dr Dana McNeil it's crucial for\ncouples to acknowledge issues around sex\nor lack thereof\nshe goes on to say many partners\ninnocently enough try to minimize the\nproblem or dismiss the issue because\nthey don't know how to handle it or are\nembarrassed be vulnerable be honest be\nbrave it can be so difficult to open up\nabout this but if your partner isn't\nwilling to empathize with you or even\nlisten to your concerns then it's time\nto move on your partner should be\nreceptive and open to listening to your\nconcerns at the very least which is\nimperative to a functional and healthy\nrelationship did you relate to any of\nthese signs if so what do you plan to do\nnext let us know in the comments below\nif you found this video helpful be sure\nto hit the like button and subscribe to\npsych2go
