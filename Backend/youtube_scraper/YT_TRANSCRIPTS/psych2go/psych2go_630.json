    "transcript": "have you ever wondered what it's like to\nbe in love not the kind of love\nportrayed in rom-coms which usually\ncomes about after a series of meet cute\nand dramatic breakups but the kind of\nlove that suddenly occurs to you when\nlooking at your significant other and\nyou realize that you want to stay by\ntheir side as long as you can\nwhat happens in between those two\nmoments how do you end up falling in\nlove\nthere are several theories and ideas\nabout how people fall in love most of\nthem are abstract but let's focus on the\ntheories that have some scientific\nevidence\nbody\non a physiological level there are many\nsigns and symptoms you may experience\nsweaty Palms racing hearts and\nbutterflies all of these symptoms are\nsimply a response to the thousands of\nbiochemical interactions happening\ninside of you\nyou hold hands and oxytocin is activated\nyou go on a date and get home feeling\nlike you're in the clouds cortisol\nlevels have decreased the early stages\nof falling in love are governed by a\nseries of complex reactions this is what\nwe sometimes think of as romance\nthis stage is filled with angst passion\nand wanting to spend every second with\nthat other person\nalthough it's common in the early stages\nof a relationship it can happen multiple\ntimes through a long lasting\nrelationship too\nmind\nbut what happens neurologically why do\nyou fall in love in 2015 doctors Richard\nSchwartz and Jacqueline old published\ntheir findings based on studies on love\none of their findings supported the idea\nthat love or being in love is a\nprimitive need this concept was\nsupported by Helen Fisher's 2005 study\nwhich presents fmri images of the brain\nwhen it's in love regions of the brain\nlike the quotient nucleus and ventral\ntegmental areas are active when\nresearchers showed participants images\nof their romantic Partners the ventral\nTech mental is associated with pleasure\nattention and motivation to pursue\nRewards\nit's no wonder these regions light up in\nthese participants the brains of these\nparticipants Associated their partners\nwith pleasure and detention\nadditionally these two regions are\ninvolved in a primitive neural network\nthat enables us to go after things we\ndesire that is possibly why we\nconstantly seek for the person we love\nanother region involved in Falling in\nLove is the nucleus accumbens the\nnucleus accumbens is responsible for\nactivities connected to goals and\nrewards be it food sex regulating stress\nand self-behavior administration this\nregion together with the prefrontal\ncortex and the amygdala is responsible\nfor helping us make assessments of\nothers but when in love this region\nshuts down hence the famous saying love\nis blind in a conversation with Harvard\nmedical journal Dr old asserted we know\nthat primitive areas of the brain are\ninvolved in romantic love and that these\nareas light up on brain scans when\ntalking about a loved one of course\nthere are other factors at Play not only\nare these regions activated but also\ndopamine oxytocin and vasopressins which\nall play a role in the attachment\nprocess dopamine gets released as a\nresult of the activation in the reward\ncenter the oxytocin is released during\nphysical contact but oxytocin is not\njust a feel-good neurotransmitter it\nworks together with vasopressin to\ncreate attachment that suppressant is\nwhat produces long-term relationships\nif oxytocin is What deepens feelings\nafter two people have sex then\nvasopressin produces long-term\nattachment the settling of these two\nchemicals is what helps calm the initial\nearly relationship Jitters once the\nrelationship has calmed down many people\nbelieve that love has died out but\nthat's not the case Dr Schwartz and old\nproved these regions are still active in\npeople who have been married for over a\ndecade\na state-of-the-art investigation of love\nhas confirmed for the very first time\nthat people are not lying when they say\nthat after 10 to 30 years of marriage\nthey're still madly in love with their\npartners\nlove begins with romance which is\nnecessary to fall in love to feel your\nhearts give a few beats and to have that\nwonderful desire to see the person you\nlove this is how you slowly become\nattached to them and eventually fall in\nlove have you learned something new from\nthis video let us know in the comments\nand thanks so much for watching until\nnext time"
