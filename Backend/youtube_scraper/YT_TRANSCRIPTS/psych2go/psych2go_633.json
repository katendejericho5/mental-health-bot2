    "transcript": "I don't know about you guys but one of\nthe most infuriating parts of watching\nanime is listening to the villain\ndescribe an excruciating detail how\nthey've manipulated the entire story and\neveryone in it from day one it's\ndefinitely one of those kick yourself in\nthe back moments when all the red flags\nare laid out in front of you\nunfortunately this doesn't only happen\nin the fictional World manipulation\nhappens in real life too\nif you've ever been manipulated you can\nverify 10 out of 10 would not recommend\nso let's take a look at four signs you\ncan look out for that may mean you're\nbeing controlled by others\nlet me stay out of your way\nthere are a lot of professions out there\nthat almost require you to be a human\nlie detector Arizona State University\nProfessor Dean H Hepworth did a study in\n1993 regarding social workers and the\nmanipulation tactics they come across in\nthe field\nhe found that one common tell of a\nmanipulator is actively avoiding\nassisting the social worker in their\ninvestigation let's say the social\nworker goes to a home for an inspection\nand it's not the cleanest home the\nhomeowner might try to deter the social\nworker away from the dirty dishes in the\nsink by showing them their classic movie\ncollection or stop them from going into\nthe kids rooms by offering them some\nlunch they'll do everything in their\npower to stall or stop the process as a\nway of manipulating the situation if you\nremember Dog the Bounty Hunter we saw\nthis a lot when someone was hiding a\nfugitive and trying to convince dog they\nweren't inside while trying to block the\ndoor\nwhen you're in a situation where people\nare typically Cooperative having someone\npurposefully slowing you down can be a\nsign of manipulation\nbuy the book please\nit's Leviosa not Leviosa\nI think we all know who broke down those\nsyllables\nHermione Granger is one of our favorite\nstraight edge characters she studies is\non time for class and follows the rules\nhowever even Hermione knows that you\nneed to break the rules every now and\nthen like when she socks Draco in the\njaw Hermione is someone who truly enjoys\ndoing things the proper way but there's\nanother side to this lifestyle in her\nvideo why some narcissists feel the need\nto control everything licensed\npsychologist and YouTube psychologist Dr\nRomani explains that some people who\nlive up by the book lifestyle do so as a\nway of controlling others around them\nlet's say your partner is someone who\nworks out every morning at 7 30 a.m and\nthen has their breakfast\nif you interrupt them to ask a question\nsomeone who enjoys us that routine might\nbe a bit annoyed but answers the\nquestion\nsomeone who uses rules and structure as\na manipulation tactic might lash out at\nyou for interrupting their time they\nmight even demean You by saying you're\ndumb selfish or inconsiderate for\ninterrupting them this overreaction is a\nway of deterring you from interrupting\ntheir workout in the future\nDr Romani goes on to say that someone\nwho likes things in order tidy or a\nspecific way isn't automatically\nmanipulative it's the way the rules are\nused that make it manipulation\njust look at the bright side we've all\nhad a date that is just absolutely crap\nand makes us feel like the world is out\nto get us it happens sometimes we need\nto feel those negative emotions and work\nthrough them one of the worst things\nsomeone can tell you during that down in\nthe dumps phase is well of course things\naren't working out you're so negative\nyou need to be positive and positive\nthings will happen this can be a\nmanipulation tactic\nand Dr romani's video when narcissists\nuse positivity to control you she breaks\ndown how toxic positivity can be used to\nmanipulate someone's actions she\nexplains that someone who uses toxic\npositivity might be someone who sees the\nworld as sunny and bright and the cup\nalways full if you have the audacity to\nhave a bad day in their presence you\nneed to fix it these people feel that\nthey set the tone so everyone else needs\nto match it one example Dr Romani gives\nis a narcissistic parent who throws a\nparty for a holiday this party is a way\nfor the narcissist to restock on some\ndopamine and praise from hosting the\nparty but if you are so inconsiderate as\nto be a dark cloud on their day that\nnarcissist might guilt you into acting\nhow they want by saying things like it's\na special date can't you just act happy\nfor me you're so selfish now you find\nyourself having to psych yourself up to\nput on an oscar-winning performance if\nhappy party guest\nit's all just another manipulation\ntactic to act how the manipulator would\nlike\nin the eye of the beholder\nand How I Met Your Mother there's an\nepisode where Lily is retelling the\nstory of how she met her husband\nMarshall to her best friend Robin after\nthey met Marshall snuck into Lily's dorm\nroom with a ukulele to sing her a song\nto ask her out\nRobin points out that it's a good thing\nthat Lily liked him back if she didn't\nit might have been really creepy to have\nsome random guy break into her dorm room\nto sing a song in her video control\nversus love Dr Romani explains that\nthere is a very fine line between love\nand control and usually you are that\nfine line if your partner texts you a\ngood morning or good night text every\nsingle day some might find that to be\nreally sweet you're the first and last\nthing on their mind he\nhowever there are some that feel a bit\nsuffocated by daily texts and the\npressure to respond to them that daily\ntext can feel like manipulation to the\npeople who don't like it even though it\nwasn't meant to be manipulation\nnow let's say your partner sends you\nthat good morning text but you had a\nmeeting earlier than usual which made\nyou not able to respond\nwhen you get back to your phone you have\nthree missed calls six texts and a\nvoicemail I think that's manipulation\nBingo for those of you playing at home\nthat intense reaction is what is meant\nto manipulate you into reciprocating the\nromantic action next time\nif you ever feel like you're being\nmanipulated by a partner please reach\nout to a mental health professional as\nsoon as possible\nlook we want to see the good in people\npsychology Professor art Markman PhD\neven said so in one of his Psychology\ntoday articles this might be why it can\nbe so shocking and maddening when we\nrealize we're being manipulated\nhopefully these signs can help give you\nan idea of what to pay attention to are\nthere any signs that we didn't mention\nlet us know in the comments and we'll\nmake a part two as always keep an eye on\nPsy for more psychico content until next\ntime"
