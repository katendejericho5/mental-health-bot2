    "transcript": "hello psych2go viewers Our Guest for\ntoday's live stream is Patrick Tien\nPatrick is a licensed clinical social\nworker in a childhood trauma specialist\nPatrick is also the host of his own\namazing YouTube channel where he\ndiscusses and analyzes childhood trauma\nand mental health thank you for being\nhere Patrick I really appreciate it we\nall do thanks for having me how are you\nI'm good how are you I'm good I'm\nexcited awesome\nso your content is so inspiring and\nempowering you're helping so many people\nto heal from their traumas and seek\nmental health treatment it's common for\nsurvivors of abuse to feel conflicted or\nhesitant to speak up about their child\nabuse or traumas due to fear of being\njudged or stigmatized so first I just\nwanted to ask you no first I just wanted\nto thank you for the amazing work you do\nbecause it really is so inspiring and so\nmy first question I wanted to start out\nwith is how do you define childhood\ntrauma and what are the different types\nof abuse that stem from it\num\nit's a really good question and I want\nto say I can't see everybody out there\nbut welcome welcome to the live stream\num it's good to know that you're there I\ncan't I can't see the chat or anybody or\nanything but I know you're about 300\npeople in here right now hello 300\npeople\nput a high five in the chat or something\nlike that so the question how do I\nDefine childhood trauma\nyeah how would you define it and what\nare the different types of abuse that\nstem from it\nsure I think just simply\nwhen\num when a child is simply not safe and\nnurtured my mentor has this thing that I\nthe bar I have is pretty high\ncompared to something called like the a\nstudy which says let's say the a study\nif you took the a study questionnaire\nit's like you sort of have to have you\nhave to grow up in domestic violence or\nsee a parent being incarcerated or grow\nup in abject poverty when there's really\nall kinds of childhood trauma my mentor\nhas this phrase that anything less than\nnurturing is abusive exactly and that\nsounds like whoa that's that sounds so\ndefinitive or black and white or\nhardcore but I really think if we want\nto progress as a human race we really\nhave to look at how we raise children\nin terms of their safety you know in\nterms of setting them up for success in\nadulthood but so to flush that out a\nlittle bit what would it mean for a\nchild to not grow up in safety is\nthen we can look at it as where a\nchild's nervous system is very different\nthan an adult's\nand a child can't handle adult intensity\nor emotions\num there's attachment where they really\nyou know need to feel like they're\nthey're someone there that they can\nemotionally connect with I never really\nlike I know what it means but when they\nsay\num\nthat you can anticipate your needs\ngetting met that sounds almost a little\nbit robotic to me\nyou know what I mean like or something\nbut I really think that like not being\nsafe is not being connected to a sane\nand loving caregiver\nyou know exactly and there can be\npoverty there can be all kinds of stuff\ngoing around in the community in the\nfamily system but I really think I\nreally narrow in on the nuclear family\nand when a child has simply just simply\na workaholic parent who isn't engaged I\nwould say is less than nurturing and\nabusive I would say having a volatile uh\nparent who struggles with cluster\npersonality disorder stuff is another\nversion so there's all different types\nbut\nI really kind of defined it as when a\nchild is not safe enough to develop into\nthe human being that they were kind of\nBorn to Be\nbut you know what I mean so for parents\nto kind of get out get you know get out\nof that child's way in terms of who they\nare because another version of abuse\nwould be like the uh looks good on paper\nfamily where you have to have you have\nto be an accountant or a lawyer it's\nkind of another version of abuse because\nit's just it's you know it's it's abuse\nis it like forcing somebody to live an\nunfulfilled life\nyeah and so like what you're trying to\nsay is and I agree with this it's like\nchildhood trauma and abuse is something\nthat's complex and it's complicated it's\nnot something that's like black and\nwhite like it has to be something very\nspecific it can just be someone who's\nbeing neglected or so you know\nemotionally it doesn't have to be like\ndomestic violence exactly yeah it could\nbe you could have you can come from a\nfamily that looks amazing that has a\nbunch of money that has a bunch of\nopportunity and no one knows how to\nconnect emotionally\nthere's a cold distance between the\nchild and the parent there's weird\ncontempt because the parents haven't\ndone their work so that's just one\nversion of it there's so many versions\nand I love that you mentioned that\nbecause sometimes people will dismiss\nfrom a really privileged privileged\nground so you must must have had an\namazing childhood and that's not always\nthe case it could be the exact opposite\nyes I will say yes totally on that but I\nwill say another version of it is that\ngrowing up in something like racism or\nabject poverty is there's just a\ndifferent type of stress that comes with\nthat as well yep you know what I mean\nyeah like sort of like the kids who go\nwho are come from affluence or something\nlike that they may they may be abused at\nhome for lack of connection or being\nseen But the child who is growing up in\nabject poverty and racism can happen\nthat can the same thing can happen in\nthat family too just with a different\ncircumstance and the added stressor of\npoverty yeah\nyes yeah there's just There's A Million\nWays to Sunday that that a human being\ncan kind of not get what they need\nand so what are some common and maybe\nsome uncommon triggers and Trauma\nresponses you've seen from victims of\nchild abuse and Trauma\num sure some common ones I mean we could\nlook at it as like fight flight freeze\nthere's two more\num shame and submit which is like\nfawning and then there's another one\ncalled cry for help that we could look\nthat but when we look at that way or\nwhen we flush those out some common ones\nis\nin a very simple way I kind of look at\nchildhood trauma survivors on the\nspectrum of two extremes\nsome of us have energy that goes up\nwhere we can fight things take things\nvery personally we can Rebel we can kind\nof make things very much about us\num we can kind of rescue people or have\nbig energy or get really you know\nvisibly mad at people\nor visibly broken-hearted or disgusted\nyou know so the energy kind of goes up\non the other side of that Spectrum\nthere's like their energy goes down\nthey're more fawning they're more kind\nof taking criticism without thinking it\nthrough they uh might be seen as more\ncodependent they might be seen as more\nsort of selfless and they struggle with\nhaving a voice they can't really say no\nand they they in a somatic way they\nreally can't say no to a project at work\nbecause their body freezes up you know\nyeah and in one of your videos I think\nthat you mentioned emotional delay is a\nsymptom as well\nyep all kinds of things that's what I\nkind of I try to spell these things out\nin a relatable way in in the video and\num an emotional delay it's like it's\nlike so those are some the up and down\nenergy is sort of like a is kind of a\ncommon thing for for many childhood\ntrauma survivors and and we can be\ncombinations of going up and going down\ndepending on the situation\num but then things like um refrigerator\nBuzz depression that I talked about in\none of those videos rushing around\num without really thinking you know it's\nlike sort of like always in a rush or\nare we always in an emergency I see that\nlike impulsive behavior perhaps or kind\nnot really rushing around where it's\njust sort of like that the person lives\nin a bit of hyper vigilance in an\nunconscious emergency that they're\nrushing to get to work early\nfor fear of something that might sort of\nhappen or they're walking really fast\nthrough the mall for no reason it's just\nlike their and their energy is up it's\ntheir kind of their motor is up okay and\nnot everyone relates to these I'm trying\nto more spell out sort of really really\nspecific oddly that video was called\nproperly specific\nand I love that video thank you and the\nthe delay one is sort of let's just say\nyou get to work in the morning and\nyou're you have a weird interaction with\nyour boss they're stressed out or\nsomething like that and they stress you\nout because of that but it doesn't catch\nup with you until later in the day\nI find that many trauma survivors have\nthis\nhours or days delay of something that\ncatches up with them you know like they\nmay they may almost like lose a they may\nhear of um\nof a high school person that passed away\nand and they hear about that on Facebook\nand then they're mining this it doesn't\nreally hit them in the moment but then\ntwo or three days later some compounded\ngrief might come up about their own\nfamily like even if they didn't really I\nknow that that sounds super specific but\nit just things happen later as in a sign\nof growth is when things are happening\nmore in real time emotionally is it like\nalmost like an emotional numbness would\nyou say yup it's a I I really think\ncoming back to your first question about\nhow would you define dissociate I mean\nhow would you find childhood trauma is\nchildish another way to look at\nchildhood trauma is when the child is\nmore focused on what the adults are\ndoing or what they're going to do than\nknowing what is going on inherently in\nour own body in the moment\nis that like a parentified child\nno this is more of a of a thing of like\nbeing in our head as opposed to being in\nour body\nso most traumas childhood trauma\nsurvivors we kind of live a little bit\ndissociatively in our heads we might\nthink about our feelings more than we\ninherently know what they are\nso when the delay happens about the\nfriend passing away on Facebook or the\nor the or the fight with the partner in\nthe morning and you're not upset till\nlater\nthat might tell me that the client lives\nmore in their head than being grounded\nin their emotions in real time and\nfeeling like they're they don't\nsecond-guess their emotions and they're\nin tune with them they're attuned to\nthemselves and there's not a delay\nand so sometimes someone might\nexperience these triggers or these\ntrauma responses and they may not know\nwhy it's happening so what would you say\nif someone isn't sure that they're\nexperiencing trauma or PTSD in some\ncases\num because they're avoiding it due to\nshame or guilt what are your suggestions\nor advice for someone in the situation\nwho doesn't really know whether they did\nexperience childhood trauma they don't\nreally understand why they're acting the\nway they're acting yeah great question\num\nI want to tweak it a little bit and that\nI think on some level\nthrough our first 20 years of life we\nhave little clues that we know but we're\nnot getting any help about them\nso when the 12 year old who's growing up\nin domestic violence or with a\nnarcissistic parent or whatever there\nmight be little shades of like my mom's\ndifferent\nmy mom's different than my friend's mom\nso in some ways there's these little\nlittle crumbs of knowing\nyou know so but we're not getting any\nhelp at the time with a healthy family\nmember who can confirm like yeah your\nmom really blows up at you and it's\nreally unfair you know imagine if if\nsurvivors would have heard that from a\nhealthy parent the other parent or a\nhealthy aunt or someone who can confirm\nwhat they were feeling and what they\nwere seeing\nbut so there's that but to come back to\nyour question is it it doesn't sound\ngood but I kind of tell people that our\nchildhood trauma kind of bites Us in the\nass eventually\nyep and we can all relate to that right\nfor me like I think with most people it\nfor me at like 19 years old right before\nI got into therapy was because my\nrelationships only lasted about six\nweeks because I was a mess\nwow and for anyone out there that is\nhas had a series of relationships that\njust never seem to take off or go well\nor something like that\nthat's what I mean about it kind of\nbiting Us in the ass eventually\nor say there is a good enough\nrelationship and there's a breakup\nthat's another part where I find that\npeople to answer your question I think\nit's about kind of we know a little bit\nand then it catches up with us\nthrough some kind of we might get laid\noff we might have a loss we might have a\nbreakup we might have a reaction that is\nnot in line with our values like maybe\nwe're a parent and we scream at our kids\nand that came out of nowhere\nyeah so that's what I mean about it kind\nof biting Us in the ass somehow it\ncatches up with us\nand then I think we kind of hit a little\nbit of a bottom with it\nso what do we do at that point is where\nit some people might have to hit a\nseries of bottoms before they kind of\nwant to seek out help it's very there's\na lot of stigma around seeking out help\nif there's anything I want my channel to\ndo is just kind of normalize these\nthings\nexactly normalize it and\num\nbecause these families are really really\nsimilar and the symptoms are really\nreally similar so I don't know if that\nanswers your question about like what\nwhat does somebody kind of do is that\num\njust just kind of know at you know when\nit bites Us in the ass if we're going to\nbe at our worst\nit's a really terrible feeling but it's\nalso kind of a golden hour and an\nopportunity for change\nyou know and it's like when those\nmoments where happened those moments\nprobably were like you know there's that\ncoming back to that knowing if you're on\nyou're like dating your third\nemotionally unavailable person or trying\nto get somebody to wake up or you know\ndating another Moody person again and\nyou're back in that place like which\nvery common thing\nit's kind of like that knowing comes\nback\nyou know and that knowing is a little\nbit like oh my God you know I've been\ndoing this since I've been five years\nold with people that I'm close to you\nknow\nyeah exactly and I think that you\nmentioned that there is a stigma about\nseeking treatment which is so tragic\nbecause someone should feel proud of\nthemselves for Having the courage to\nseek treatment it's empowering and\namazing and for all those who are\nseeking treatment for it I'm proud of\nyou and I'm sure Patrick is too I am I\nam but for me that I think our inner\nchild confuses\ngetting help with really messing up our\nlife yeah you know what I mean like\nwhere it says we you know speaking from\nexperience I think\nwhen I got to therapy\num it was a little bit like well I've\nclearly messed up my life so much that\nnow I have to go do this thing because\nI'm defective and luckily I had a\ntherapist that was sort of like you're\nnot defective you just come from a\ndefective system\nit was nothing about you so the stigma I\nand especially in different cultures I\nreally kind of want to make that known\nyou know in America kind of in the west\nis like we're kind of therapy happy yeah\ngo you know what I mean we there's still\nbarriers but it's still like you know\nit's almost like what do you mean you\ndon't have a therapist\nbut in some cultures\nit sometimes the cultural like sort of\nexpression is only really sick people\nneed therapy\nyes that's actually very common in a lot\nof cultures and it's so\ntragic and counterproductive as well\nbecause I mean it I think that a lot of\ntherapists have said this and they you\nknow put it best when they say when you\nbreak your leg you go to the hospital\nand so when you're having like a mental\nhealth issue you should go to a\ntherapist that's you know\nand we've normalized that in our culture\nbut in other cultures some people don't\nhave that luxury or privilege right so\nand there's all kinds of barriers but\nspeaking to the stigma around what would\nthe family say what would the the\nreligion around the culture say you know\nwhat I mean like like in a way you're\nonly supposed to talk to your problems\nwith like a religious leader or you keep\nit to yourself and don't don't burden\nthe family system that's kind of in\nsurvival mode already you know what I\nmean like and that happens in a lot of\ndifferent cultures\nyeah and that brings me to my next\nquestion about unresolved trauma so what\nare some signs of it and how can it show\nup unexpectedly\num good question\num signs of unresolved trauma\nlet's kind of break this down into\nsome categories there's our relationship\nwith ourself like being integrated\num that's one way it can show up it can\nshow up in the social I often think\nabout I often talk about what happens to\nus when we go to a coffee shop in a\nsocial environment\nand we get triggered by the Barista you\nknow what I mean or we get our inner\nchild thinks that everyone is\num not liking them or something like\nthat when we go to a party when we go to\na coffee shop you know and then the\nthird category being like when we're in\nan intimate relationship\nso let's just say in terms of Attunement\nwith ourself and being integrated with\nourselves some signs of unresolved\ntrauma is where we have really big\nreactions that come out of nowhere\nand we're not you know what I mean like\nfor anybody out there that's been\nworking at a place and then all you know\nyou just all of a sudden become enraged\nand fire off an email that kind of gets\nyou into trouble it was like an\nover-the-top reaction it's actually\npretty common for this stuff\num or the opposite of that coming back\nto that Spectrum thing I mentioned\nearlier is that you know like you're\nexhausted and you're you're overworked\nand you're just looking forward to a\nweekend off and then you automatically\ntake on more work\nbecause that's what you automatically do\nso that's kind of a sign of unresolved\nkind of like why am I doing this again\nyou know what I mean like it's just like\nI've just been I've been working 90\nhours for three weeks straight like\nwhat's wrong with me those are those\nClues\nyeah to it you know unresolved stuff in\nthe in the social setting is just kind\nof feeling like um\nI don't know like the Barista is you\nknow in a bad mood with you and they're\nupset with you or or they're literally\nkind of a jerk to you and you really get\ninto a fight in your head about it or it\nstays with you for two or three days\nabout what the Barista said but it's\nalways so much deeper it's never truly\njust about the Starbucks coffee or the\nBarista it's deeper it's you know a\ntrigger yeah but then it's showing you\nlike this why am I so focused on this\nthe person I hate jerk or they were\nhaving a bad day but the inner child\ngoes back to a place in childhood the\nunresolved stuff where it's like oh my\nGod they were just like my mother they\nwere Moody they were aggressive they\nwere all blamey and shamey and I\ncouldn't even get a word in it's almost\nlike an emotional flashback yep that's\nwhat it really yeah that's what I really\nkind of think I don't really think I\nthink we kind of have an Hollywood idea\nof what flashbacks are\nbut they're really for the most part\nbody memories\nof a moody person or a person being mad\nat us or something like that you know\nyeah and the unresolved stuff in in the\nthird category of relationships is\num\nunresolved trauma a big one is when the\ninner child feels like there's got to be\nsomething wrong and they keep checking\nsomething out with a partner are we okay\nare you okay how about now because you\nseemed upset earlier you know like\nthat's that's a sign all of these are\nkind of signs\nbut the wild thing is I don't know if\nyou would agree with this is that for\nthe person it's just like well this is\njust normal this is the way I've been my\nwhole life\nagain a lot of that I've been terrified\nabout what anyone thinks about me don't\nyou you know like like I agree with you\nlike they've normalized it and it seems\nnormal to them but it's a really a\ntrauma response right I thought that's\nhow the world operated yeah that's all\nthey've known right\none sign for me was I you know I came\nfrom a very caustic family system and in\nmy first jobs how I would connect with\npeople would be through negativity and\ngossip\noh wow I can relate to that actually and\nthen and I thought that that was so\nnormal\nand then when I'm kind of out in the\nworld I think that this is what happens\nwhen we leave home we go to college we\nstart our first job there's something\nlike that and for the child to trauma\nSurvivor it's very jarring because they\nthink that they're just doing what\nthey're you know they are just doing\nwhat they were taught are just coming\nfrom this family system that we would\ntalk trash about people to feel better\nabout ourselves and I would gossip\namongst like you know other co-workers\nand stuff like that and then people\nwould be like yeah I'm not really\ninterested in that and then I'd be like\nwhat I can relate to that so much I\nwould be baffled you know about why\nsomeone wouldn't want to be that\nnegative when I was kind of what was\nimmersed on it in it at home yeah and I\nused to see it as something normal too\nbut really it truly is so toxic but I\nthought it was something that like\neveryone does it it's part of life it's\ngossip cheese man as they would say in\nSpanish really\nthat means gossip in Spanish oh right\ngotcha yeah and so I definitely agree\nwith that and so we'll normalize certain\nthings that really are just triggers or\ntrauma responses yep and just as a\nreminder to the viewers please ask your\nquestions for Patrick in the live chat\nwe're about to go into that segment but\nbefore that I wanted to ask about the\nconcept of the inner child which you do\nmention in a lot of your videos yeah I\njust wanted to know\num you mentioned that it's an effective\nstrategy to connect with your inner\nchild\nyou've mentioned that and so I just want\nto know\num what is how does one connect with\ntheir inner child in an effective way to\ncope with childhood trauma that they\nexperienced\num let me say a little bit that to back\nup a little bit\nto define a little bit of what the inner\nchild is because some people have it\nsome people\nhave a negative you know what I mean\nthey kind of go like oh that's just so\nhippy-dippy you know what I mean it's\nactually positive the way you approach\nit yeah it's what you know if you if you\nstruggle with that concept of the inner\nchild or don't like the language\nyou could look at it as they're you know\nin the work that I do there are really\ntwo parts which is\ndifferent than something called ifs\nwhich often gets confused for the work\nthat I do\num there's an inner adult and then\nthere's an inner child you could look at\nthe inner child as a part of your brain\ncalled the limbic system where childhood\ntrauma or trauma in general is stored\nour emotional memory system and the\nemotional smoke alarm like AKA hyper\nvigilance living in emergency where all\nof that stuff lives\num hippocampus amygdala part of the\nlimbic system that's all the inner child\na different part of the brain called the\nprefrontal lobes is are you know I'm\nusing it my right now because I'm I have\nthe ability to talk emotionally with you\nin a calm guided way\nand I can think and feel at the same\ntime\nwhen the limbic system is activated we\nmight lose our words or we might become\nreally sharp and focused with our words\nin an attacking way or we might really\nshut down or something like that so\nthese two parts of our brain we could\nlook at it as the inner child and the\ninner adult or we could look at it as a\nbit of a battle between until healing\nbetween the limbic system and our\nprefrontal cortex prefrontal lobes which\nis like our best functioning self\nso for the listener out there is that\nwhen you've been triggered by the\nBarista and that takes you out for a\ncouple days and you just can't get it\ntogether or get the laundry done or get\nto those emails you're in your limbic\nsystem you're activated probably some\nbrain fog that kind of a thing when you\nrally and come out of it that's when the\nprefrontal lobes kind of kick back on\nso if anyone out there has had a bad\ninteraction with somebody unless the\nBaristas poor Barista\num\nfor the majority of the morning or\nsomething like that but then when you\nwhen you wake up and go oh why didn't I\nsay that\nthat's your prefrontal cortex coming\nback online\nso I wanted to say that a little bit\nabout those two parts and a lot of the\nwork is around integration and\nAttunement and learning how to be a\nhealthy parent from yourself from the\ninner adult place\nand helping that inner child by\nvalidating them or talking to them and a\nlot of that talking to them is that hey\nyou know what that Barista isn't in our\nlife they're not they're not really\nimportant we don't have to take them so\nseriously we don't have to take it so\npersonally but our family made it very\nvery personal so I think that that's\nwhat the trigger is about yeah and it's\nlike a\nwhy do I feel this way\nwould you say\ning that and so before we get to the\naudience questions\num you mentioned inner child dialoguing\nor journaling as a coping strategy can\nyou explain for our viewers exactly what\nthat is and how it's beneficial to the\nhealing process\nsure it is I I don't want to call it\njournaling because it's really more of a\ndiscussion between those two parts that\nI mentioned between your dominant and\nyour non-dominant hand your dominant\nhand represents the adult and our\ndominant hand is like right catch the\nball do the thing you know comb the hair\nit's a very\num guiding Focus part of our brain and\nfor some reason what gets kind of left\nover is we kind of have this access to\nour inner child through our non-dominant\nhand\nso the idea is on paper you ask your\ninner child questions as if you were\nlike a loving foster care parent\nand you know what the kid went through\nbut you're asking them you know little\nPatrick when\nwe told them the latte wasn't made with\noat milk this morning and they got mad\nat you you know what did that take you\nback to because I sensed you were mad\nabout that you know what I mean and then\nthe inner child will answer people\nalways treat me this way I'm never\nrespected I don't know what it is about\nme\nthe inner child is telling the truth\nabout what it was like growing up but\nthey're projecting it onto the barista\nso like for example for me I should ask\nmyself little Michelle what is it about\nthat you know that's upsetting and maybe\ntakes you back to the past yes and\nsometimes you know it's really like\nhaving a relationship with a real child\nthey might not want to talk to you or\nthey might want to talk to you or\nsometimes the inner adult can name if\nthe inner child doesn't answer you could\nsay well I know growing up with Mom and\nDad they were so critical and blamed you\nfor everything did it feel like that so\nsometimes it's really like a real kid\nyou just can't bust bust in and ask\nquestions there really has to be like a\nkind of a warm-up and getting getting to\nknow you if you're the first time doing\nit I have I have a webinar on it on my\nwebsite about how to do it it's an\ne-course that people can grab\nand I think it's so amazing how you\napproach it it's like unique because I\nhaven't heard that before and I think\nthat it's a really beneficial coping\nstrategy so thank you for that sure and\nthe one last piece about it is every you\nknow I still dialogue and if I'm upset\nit always regulates my system because\nwhen we're doing this this conversation\nbetween the two hands it has the same\nfunctionality of something called EMDR\nwhere it's bilateral stimulation anytime\nthe two hemispheres of our brain have an\ninteraction or a bit of a dance I get\nthis from playing drums as well because\nit's different limbs at different times\nit regulates our system so it's not just\na integration tool it's really the best\nthing that we can do when we're\ntriggered is start to work with our\ninner child on paper and trying to\nfigure it out and even if you don't\nfigure it out\nyou've already done interaction between\nyour two hemispheres and it might calm\nyou down or soothe you\nmm-hmm\nyeah\num\nwhat do you mean by that like soothe you\ncould you explain that\num when we're holding a child and we're\nrocking\nyou mean that is soothing the child and\nthis the child is getting this kind of\nback and forth action that is a lot like\nbilateral stimulation our brain is made\nup into these two hemispheres and\nwhenever those two hemispheres are\nequally engaged\nit kind of calms our system down\nmm-hmm it's it's kind of like a neat\nneat trick so in something called EMDR\ntherapists are having the person follow\ntheir eyes onto either they're hearing a\nping pong or they're watching something\nand that is again it's a bilateral\nstimulation between the two hemispheres\nthat kind of chills them out or releases\nsomething if they're talking about a\ntraumatic event\nand so\nI'm going to switch to audience\nquestions because there's like 500\npeople in here and there's like tons of\nquestions so everybody what's up to you\nso we're gonna move to that segment so\nsomeone said what is the difference\nbetween or the interchangeability\nbetween coping and healing from\nchildhood trauma is there a difference\nwow that's a really good question\num\nthe more coping we learn\nI think greatly\ngives us the capacity to heal more\nlet's just let's just say we've all\nheard they're kind of annoying but when\nwe heard when we hear stuff like show up\nfor yourself in small ways every day\nlike prep your prep your lunch ahead of\ntime or make your bed or something like\nthat or do something or try to get to\nbed early\nthose are like small little Wellness\ntricks\nand the more we kind of get into a\npattern of being able to consistently do\nthat I think the inner child trusts our\ninner adult more or we trust ourselves\nmore we're the same person\nso it makes me kind of think about that\nbut can you read the question again\nthey said like what's the difference\nbetween healing and coping with\nchildhood trauma\num\ncoping coping is another way to look at\nthat question coping is just coping\ncoping is using your tools like if it\nwas something called DBT and you're\ndoing stress relieving things or really\ntrying to calm your system down coping\nis just coping to help you out in the\nmoment\nhealing though is I think coming from\nsome pretty heavy lifting in therapy\nor some really different really shifts\nabout looking at what happened to us and\ncoming up with a new belief system but\nnot just looking at what happened to us\nbut really grieving and processing\nwhat I think with a good therapist being\na witness to that or better yet a good\ngroup\nso it's a great question the two things\nare different but a lot of clients are\nfrustrated by therapists who are just\nlike just be mindful\nor just you know like just make your bed\nthat kind of a thing that doesn't lead\nus to Healing that comes that leads us\nto Better Living\nbut the healing of whether we're a good\nperson or a bad person I comes from I\nthink that that comes from a different\nthing\ngreat question thank you for clarifying\nthat because I did want to know the\ndifference between coping and healing so\nthank you for that and then John asked\nis this just blaming everything on our\nparents yes\nI'm being facetious but I get that\nquestion so much uh blame is different\nthan accountability\nand there's a thing the elephant in the\nroom is generational trauma my father\nprobably had not probably my father had\na worse childhood than I was but my\nfather was very abusive\nand in the type of therapy that I do is\nthat we I think the person needs to\nspend some time\nmaybe getting some distance from their\nfamily looking at what happened holding\nthem accountable for like a parent not\nprotecting one of their kids from a\nperpetrator maybe the other parent or\nsomething like that we need to process\nthat and we kind of need to have our\nemotional day in court about that and\nyou know I think after we've done that\nin a good enough way and really spent\nsome time embracing that we were a good\nkid and you know it wasn't necessary\nthat kind of a thing I'm trying to say\nthat after healing we can look at what\nhappened to our parents\nbut I find if people are trying to do it\nboth at the same time they really get\nstuck\nwhat I mean by that is that let's just\nsay that there was a sexually abusive\nalcoholic parent there's plenty of stuff\nwe can blame them for\nplenty and that's okay to do but we're\nholding them accountable maybe they had\na horrific childhood that set them up\nfor that kind of stuff but I would say\nthat really figure yourself out first\nand get some healing first before you\nthink about the abusive parents\nchildhood because more understanding and\ncompassion can come come later but if we\nonly if we're only thinking about what\nthe parent went through and a little bit\nabout us we're not really going to heal\nprobably\nthis is not for everybody my work really\nisn't sort of for everybody\nand I see what you're saying\num and so rekka asks I really want\ntherapy but in my country they think\npeople who go to therapy are mentally\ndisabled what should I do\num\nI think if we if we talk about to the\naccess to health care I have it's there\nare so many barriers and I would say to\ntry to beg borrow and steal\nto really find your way to someone that\ncan help you whether that's seeing if\nsomeone can do remote sessions with you\noutside of the country it might take six\nmonths might take three months to find\nsomebody\nbut to really give it a good shot\nbecause there are countries that like I\nsaid earlier that just think that you\nhave to be severely mentally challenged\nor disabled in order to see a therapist\nand that's it's it's just kind of\ninhumane so at best to try to look\noutside your country\num and sometimes I know that that's not\neven possible too so I want to be real\nabout that\nand I wanted to put it out there that\nseeking mental health treatment is\ninspiring and empowering it's not\nsomething that should be stigmatized\never for any reason\nand so keons asked I need to ask a\nquestion is it normal for every kid to\ngo through a really long phase of being\nterrified of sleeping in the dark on\ntheir own like for years and staying\nawake for hours every night even as an\nadult\num\na powerful question\num no I don't believe it's normal I will\nsay it's common\nmany childhood trauma survivors have\nissues around sleep and anxiety at night\nI think if someone is getting their\nneeds met from a healthy family system\nthe family is something that I call\nchild Centric\nthat in the early years that there is a\ngood night ritual like reading stories\nin bed affection snuggling safety that\nkind of a thing but when we're raised\ncoming back to that idea about anything\nless than nurturing is abusive\nit's like here we are again when parents\naren't thinking about\nthe safety development health of their\nchild you know kids are just kind of\nsent to bed\nand\nI look at the the sleep stuff as a\ndirect\nkind of clue or sign that there wasn't\nhealthy attachment\nthat there wasn't healthy Attunement\nso I know it's confusing is it normal no\nis it common for childhood trauma yes\nbut don't take that as oh good you know\nwhat I mean I'm just saying many kids\nare being raised in that kind of neglect\nI would say it's not normal I would say\nit's severe emotional childhood neglect\nand so then Elsa asked when something\nsurfaces and you feel triggered how do I\nknow its roots are deeper and coming\nfrom childhood trauma\ncan you read it again\num Elsa asks when something surfaces and\nyou feel or I feel triggered how do I\nknow its roots are deeper and coming\nfrom childhood trauma\nso this is the question\nthis is the question that I think\num and it's really hard to articulate\nI'm not trying to be bitter or something\nbut I'll probably be discussing this\nquestion for the majority of my career\nbecause it's really tricky\num\nthe Barista okay\nBarista if the Barista is a kind of a\njerk to us and we get really we really\ntake it personally there is a present\nissue going on and that present issue is\nthe jerky barista all right you know but\nwhat the Barista triggers or brings up\nof a body memory is the thing to focus\non\nand I would say that 80 percent of the\nenergy of the trigger around the Barista\nsituation or the Moody partner or the\nweird performance review that we get at\nwork or just the world\num\nthe world is a mess right now that's a\npresent issue but it might take us back\nto our younger world\nyou know so the I love the question so\nmuch because it's how do you suss out\nwhat belongs in the present and what\ndoesn't and coming back to dialoguing is\nyour inner child will tell you\nthrough how they talk about the barista\nlike I mentioned earlier like I um I\nalways end up as the jerk in this thing\nI'm always wrong that is the the that is\nyour inner child telling you what the\neveryday life was like growing up I'm\nalways wrong\noh that's powerful and then that tells\nyou that that child had no reciprocity\nor shared power\nso it's really it takes a long time it\ntook me a long time to figure out my\ntriggers you know you could be dating a\nsociopath you could be dating a very\nunsafe person\nbut they are like a present issue taking\nit taking you back to an early volatile\nperson or a very unprotective person\nparent\nand that's why that yeah go ahead sorry\nreally appreciate that question because\nit's just it's thank you it's more\nthere's a practice in trying to figure\nthat stuff out but I will say this when\nanyone is triggered don't ask them if\nthey're triggered because that makes it\nworse yeah it does\num but when we're triggered there's a\npractice around it's really hard to\nfigure out because\nyou know if anyone else is leaving the\nStarbucks that person might be like wow\nthat person was a jerk to you in line\nyou should talk to the manager that can\nfeel really validating about the present\nand even furtherly confusing you yeah\nbut if we go dialogue with our inner\nchild and you know what I mean like\nthat's where the content of childhood\ncomes up and then what's the answer when\nwe when we grow and we progress and we\nheal more by the time we've left the\ndoor\nof the of this of the coffee shop we're\nlike wow that person was a pain in the\nass I'm not coming back here and then\nwe're done with it\nit doesn't stay with us you know\nnow that makes sense and then uh Casey\nasks how would you recommend interacting\nwith in-law family members specifically\nsister-in-laws that are really\nactivating to be around and or in very\nintense towards myself and my partner\nthis one is super hard and\nI won't spend too much time on it is I\nhave\nI don't know I don't really know if this\nis actually correct but how I advise\npeople is to say I think the partner\nshould be setting boundaries with the\nfamily\nnot the spouse trying to make something\nhappen\nso the other piece to that is that when\nyou know say a young couple gets married\nand then\num he is I'll just do that in a\ntraditional gendered kind of marriage\nyou know heterosexual marriage he is\nreally triggered by his mother-in-law\nwho's really\num aggressive intrusive and that kind of\na thing\nand his wife doesn't set boundaries\ngives the mother still a lot of power do\nyou follow me on this yes this is tricky\num I really think it's the it's up to\nthe wife in that situation to really\nkind of set the boundaries so there's\nmore of a couple situation going on or a\ncouple's problem\nso it's a really powerful question in a\nway but the other side to that too\ncoming back to what I said earlier is so\nyou have a present problem which is your\nsister-in-laws\nbut do they take you back to your own\nfamily system in some way\nabout kind of being a pain in the ass\nabout being aggressive or about being\noverly opinionated who might that take\nyou back to in your own childhood and\nthat might actually help you with your\nfeelings and how to navigate it too\nbecause when when people like that\nreally trigger us\nif we're not aware of what it triggers\nus to we're we're kind of up the creek a\nlittle bit Yeah because our inner child\nis going to make it all about those\nsister-in-laws\nyeah\nso it's just always that self-assessment\nright like analyzing what what is this\nyeah because it can be both it can be\nthat maybe it can be both it can be both\nthat the person is insulting you or\nbeing rude but it's also like triggering\nas well it's both\nyep and so last question from Grant is\nit dangerous to use to use the feeling\nof unconditional love you develop for\nyourself through healing from childhood\ntrauma as the framework for love in a\nrelationship\ncan you read it again I don't know if I\nunderstand the question so is it\ndangerous to use the feeling of\nunconditional love you develop for\nyourself through healing as the\nframework for love in a relationship\nlike a romantic relationship\num\nI don't quite know I feel like I would\nwant to know more but I will say this\nthe relationship with our inner child\nand the unconditional love there\num is if we can get to that place your\nlife will change I think you know for\nthat's for everyone not just the author\nof the question but\num\nhow we approach our partners\nI don't I don't really quite know I will\nsay this is that when it comes to our\npartners\nthere's a difference between self-love\nthat we have\nand then how we love our partners in a\nway that here's what a really healthy\nBenchmark is is that our partner\nenhances our life not completes our life\nexactly because the message because the\ninner child often and I I spent years in\nthis you know I think that when we don't\ngrow up in safety this is why it's so\nimportant for kids to get what they need\nwe grow up into adults looking for\nparents in in the wrong person or\nabusive people\nin in a healthy relationship anytime we\ncan help our our partners out with their\ninner children but if we if we're dating\nfrom a place or loving from a place of\nlike please love me you know what I mean\nyeah that's about the missing parent in\nour lives from childhood not so much\nabout a partner so you know\nunconditional love is great but our our\npartner should really enhance our life\num but they don't complete it the way\nthat an infant and mother would be\ncompleted exactly and so you're saying\nlike sometimes people will try to\ncompensate for what they didn't get in\nchildhood sure in a romantic wow now\nthat is so true that's a powerful\nmessage one last thing is that you know\nwhen we fall in love with people it's\njust magical a beginning relationship is\njust totally magic and there's a lot of\nchemicals and a lot of just Beauty and\nsoulmate kind of stuff going on\nbut then the rubber really hits the road\nin intimacy\nonce that wears down a little bit\nthere's a new version of love which is\ntrying to do conflict it's I call it the\nyou know marriage or partnership or\nwhatever is the final frontier I think\nfor people to really grow with somebody\nand grow in intimacy so those two things\nare really kind of different\nyeah I agree with that and so that is\nthe end of our audience segment portion\nthank you guys for that love those\nquestions right amazing questions very\npowerful yeah exactly\num and so my final questions are how do\nwe support victims of child abuse\nespecially since children are the most\nvulnerable community\nyeah and are we talking about adult\nadults who have gone through childhood\ntrauma no like current abuse I mean we\nneed to support them too but I just want\nto know like how do we how do we prevent\nit and support you know victims of child\nabuse who are enduring it as we speak\noh this is always a heartbreaking\nquestion\num\nin the U.S our system is broken\nabout keeping Kids Safe\nthere's Department of Youth and families\nDepartment of Children and Families my\nexperience is they don't have a lot of\npower\nin terms of really keeping Kids Safe\nlet's just say the cops are called in on\na domestic violence call and they're\nmandated reporters so they file\num Department of Children family service\nto do to do a you know an assessment in\nmy in from what people tell me from my\nexperience if they show up and they\ninterview both the parents and then the\nhouse looks okay they're fine\nthey might recommend getting into\ntherapy or something like that you know\nthings the the bar I think about things\ngoing south in a child's life is way too\nlow\nfor the community or Society to kind of\nStep In you know but that's coming from\nmy experience of 10 years ago when I\nworked in that world and agency settings\nand stuff like that I hope it's changed\nI don't really hear a lot of sort of\nchanging there so I would just sort of\nsay the system is broken but\nif you have that nephew or niece\nor if you have that neighbor's kid that\nyou know\nisn't really or it's just sort of like\nor if you're in a blended family and you\nknow that your partner's ex is really\nabusive\nI think\nto be able to say to a child\num\nkind of something like I see you you\nknow and it's it's I see what you're\ngoing through and\num it's not okay\nand someday you can talk to me about it\nif you want to\nyeah that's the best I got to be honest\nand it bothers me that I don't have more\nthan that but thinking in our own\nstories if anyone identifies as growing\nup in abuse what would it have been like\nif you were 13 years old and you're\ngrowing up in your own mess and then\nsomebody a neighbor or somebody outside\nor something like that said you know you\nknow whatever you're feeling is totally\nright on because I I have a feeling like\nyou're not fully getting what you need\nor you're not listened to or you're not\nbelieved\nyou know the kid's probably going to be\nfreaked out they're not going to know\nwhat to do with it but they'll remember\nit yeah you know and that memory of it I\nthink is going to be huge for them\nsometimes I'll I'll have a client that\nhad a teacher who did that for them and\nthey not never forgot it because like I\nin the beginning of this live stream\nwhen I mentioned these little crumbs of\nknowledge\nwhen you're 13 years old you kind of\nknow that something's off you just can't\nname it yeah so we need we need help we\nneed help from healthy adults and what\nI'm suggesting is really hard because\nit'll feel like you're really\noverstepping\nand I don't think that people realize or\nthey might underestimate the power of\njust a helping hand of just talking to\nsomeone of just sitting them down saying\nhey I care and I just want to know\nwhat's going on right when I have\nclients who are in this situation of\nthey might be an aunt or an uncle and\nthey they know that their niece and\nnephew is just growing up in a mess you\nknow I have a weird Star Wars analogy\nand I say you kind of have to be Ben\nKenobi for a while and Ben Kenobi was in\nthe proximity of Luke Skywalker kind of\nwatching him a little bit or being\navailable for him when he needed him one\nday\nso that's kind of what I mean about it's\nheartbreaking where for that your niece\nor nephew is 13 years old they may not\nbe able to take anything in for another\n10 or 8 years\nabout what's going on with them so I\njust kind of say you know be available\nmaybe when that moment happens it's just\nlike a sane person\nI agree with that and I think that is\nthe best advice to give because\nsometimes it really is like you can't\nalways\nyou know sometimes you just have to to\nintervene and sometimes you can't\nintervene but you can at least provide\nthat emotional support so I agree with\nthat and it's powerful right and it's a\nlot of grief and letting go because we\ndon't have a lot of power that's what I\ndon't like about Society we don't have a\nlot of power over keeping kids as safe\nas we would like\nyeah exactly and so thank you so much\nfor being here today this information is\nso valuable to our viewers and helpful\nso thank you so much for that and the\namazing work that you do\nthank you so much I've Loved this\nthank you\nand so\num I hope everyone has a good day I hope\nthat everyone got something valuable out\nof this we're doing it for you guys for\nmental health awareness month so\nthank you again Patrick and everyone\nhave a good day thanks for tuning in be\nwell bye bye"
