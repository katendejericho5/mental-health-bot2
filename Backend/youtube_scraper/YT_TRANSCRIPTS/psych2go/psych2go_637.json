often complete sentences\nintervene predict information and make\nassumptions due to their intuition and\nquick thinking given their analytical\nand objective minds entjs are great at\nidentifying The Faults and weaknesses of\nothers however when paired with their\nunawareness of the feelings of others it\nmay make them look judgmental nitpicky\nand uncompromising when entjs start to\ndevelop humility by appreciating other\npeople and allowing them to be heard\nthey will become more attractive entjs\nmust improve their listening skills and\nnot simply for the sake of arguing back\nintj\nfor intj's rationality often matters\nmore than the emotional aspect in a\nromantic relationship they approach it\nlike most other issues systematically\nwith clear strategies for accomplishing\nthem unfortunately love is seldom\nlogical and you might misunderstand the\ncomplexity of human nature and emotion\nin the face of strong emotions intjs\nwill often turn to analyze the problem\nor simply shut down instead of just\nlistening and giving support you might\nalso become uncomfortable when you need\nto be vulnerable to those close to you\nas an intj you can try to spend more\ntime introspecting and reflecting on\nyour emotional experience\nthrough this experience you can learn to\nconnect with your feelings stay\nconnected with others and encounter\ntremendous emotional growth\nestp gregarious and fun-loving estps are\nthe life of the party entertaining\npeople and creating an atmosphere of\nexcitement are their Forte esdps\nprioritize facts and reality over\nfeelings and emotions while estps do not\nintend to hurt others their lack of\nunderstanding of subtle emotions may\nmake them appear cold and insensitive to\nothers needs at times these\npersonalities often have a lot of\ntrouble acknowledging and expressing\ntheir own feelings as their attention is\noften directed away from themselves\npreventing them from self-reflection\npstps can be more attractive by being\nmore approachable and vulnerable with\ntheir emotions they should be more open\nto taking time for self-reflection and\nintrospection rather than focusing on\nthe external environment or constantly\ngiving attention to things outside of\nthemselves by engaging in healthy\nintrospection they can gain valuable\nlessons about their own character and\ndevelopment and address their own\nweaknesses\nistp inherently inquisitive about the\nmechanics of the world around them istps\nlove to study how things work and\nfrequently Master the operation of\nmachines devices and Equipment\nistps are experts in Technical and\nmechanical matters which range from\nrepairing a motorcycle to\ntroubleshooting a computer\nthey are also quite helpful around the\nhouse and can fix almost anything with\ntheir hands putting ideas into action\nhowever their Knowledge and Skills may\nnot necessarily be transferable istp is\noften heavily focus on one or two areas\nsuch as engineering or coding and spend\nno time outside of those Hobbies as a\nresult they may appear a little dull\nit's important that istps grow in their\nability to explore topics outside of\ntheir domain or expertise they can pick\nhobbies that hone their abstract or\nartistic skills rather than choosing one\nthat involves cold analytical data for\nexample they can learn new languages\nphotography or painting\nesfp remember that one friend who\nspontaneously broke into song while you\nwere shopping for your weekend barbecue\nparty\nthe world is like a stage this Spotlight\nmakes them feel alive each outing is a\nparty for them they enjoy soaking up the\nattention and making all things feel\nfestive\nif you have someone in your life with\nthis Lively and entertaining personality\nthey are most likely esfps however their\nexceptional Showmanship in Candor may\nnot make them immune to criticism they\nare highly sensitive Souls who might be\nprofoundly wounded when others criticize\ntheir views attitudes or behavior esfps\ncan boost their desirability by not\ntaking criticism so seriously and to\navoid reacting with bitterness and\nhostility it may not feel easy at first\nto reprogram their thought pattern but\nwith effort and determination they might\nbecome less reactive and more\nopen-minded\nisfp isfps enjoy an adaptable flexible\nway of living they live in the moment\ntaking each day as it comes however\nisfps go with the flow mindset may cause\nthem to be blind to the full\nconsequences of their action and be\nunable to stick to long-term plans as a\nresult they may experience financial\ndifficulties be thrown off guard by\ntragedies or not realize how unaddressed\nissues May sour relationships over time\nthose interested in getting to know\nisfps may perceive isfps as\nirresponsible and not ready for\ncommitment and serious relationships\nisfps should sometimes look at the whole\nForest rather than the trees\nrelationships are all about balancing\nthe present with the future isfps must\nhave a mutual understanding with their\npartner of where they're heading in the\nrelationship and they must also allow\nsome space to Simply focus on the\npresent moment\nESTJ natural planners and organizers\nestjs thrive on making lists and\nschedules in their daily lives estjs are\nhighly committed to their principles and\nbeliefs and have a clear image of what\nqualifies and what does not however this\nblack and white perspective may push\npeople away as esdjs fail to realize\nthat there is more than one solution you\nwill May view estjs as being judgmental\nstubborn or rigid as estjs may become so\nfixed in their initial stance that they\nrefuse to acknowledge any new evidence\nthat might result in a different and\nmaybe more accurate conclusion estjs can\nwork on their attractiveness scale by\nbeing more humble and realizing their\nway is not the only way focus on being\nmore Curious asking questions and\nacknowledge that other people may have\nanother perspective that can be\ncompletely different than what they have\nis TJ some of istj's admirable traits\nare their dedication and integrity they\nfrequently take responsibility for their\ndecisions where they are able to admit\ntheir mistakes regardless of whether it\ncauses them to appear bad they value\nhonesty highly which drives them to heed\ntheir conscience rather than deceive to\nappease others schedules are extremely\nimportant and changes to them are not\nwelcome as they often resist even\nnecessary changes they always act by the\nbook which can sometimes make the people\nin their lives feel suffocated when\nisdjs are reluctant to bend those rules\nDJ should try to let life flow naturally\nand experiment with taking on an\nunplanned date with their partner it\nwill also benefit them to be open-minded\nto discuss alternatives to rules or\nschedules that don't work rather than\nstaying in the familiar rut of tradition\nESFJ\nesfjs are devoted helpers who are\nmindful of the needs of others and are\nenthusiastically committed to their\nobligations being sensitive to the\nemotions of others is natural to esfjs\nthey invest their emotions time and\neffort to manage things for their loved\nones so they can be regarded as\ntrustworthy however their eagerness to\nplease can sometimes mean that they\nleave themselves out of the equation to\nincrease their attractiveness ESFJ\nshould realize that nobody is capable of\npleasing everyone at all times\nthey might at times become too dependent\non others to the point that they feel\nuneasy if there is no one around to chat\nwith so it's highly suggested for esfjs\nto take part in solitary hobbies to\nincrease their self-reliance connect\nwith their feelings and figure out how\nto function without continuous external\nstimulation\nisfj\ndo you know someone who rolls up their\nsleeves and shows up when someone needs\ntheir help and support\nkeeping strong connections with our\nloved ones is a top priority and they\ndevote a lot of energy to showing up for\nother people\nisfjs are recognized for their\noutstanding work ethic yet this positive\nattribute May quickly turn into\nworkaholism leaving isfjs so overwhelmed\nthat they become distracted and removed\nfrom what is important in their personal\nlife as a result the close people in\ntheir life may feel neglected and less\nimportant for isfjs they can become more\nattractive by setting healthy boundaries\nbetween their professional and personal\nlife so they don't clash and affect each\nother for example when it's time to\nleave the workplace they should do so\nand try to shift their focus from work\nback to their relationships\nENFJ\nan enfj's deep sense of altruism and\nempathy drives them to act when they see\npeople suffering they are intuitive when\nit comes to connecting with others\nemotions and they can read other\npeople's emotions simply by being near\nthem their compassion however is not\nlimited to those near them they often\nhave humanitarian Tendencies and are\nconcerned about the suffering of\nhumankind however while they are eager\nto help they can sometimes neglect their\nresponsibilities to help the ones around\nthem as such those interested in enfjs\nhave the impression that they don't have\ntime for anything more than friendship\nenfjs can become more attractive by\nknowing when to prioritize their loved\nones versus The Strangers they want to\nhelp it's wonderful to have a deep\ndesire to help people in need but this\ndoes not release them from their duties\nas a partner friend or family member or\nENFJ relationships to flourish they must\ncontinue investing their time energy and\nlove in the close people they care about\ninfj\nmuch like real life chameleons INFJs are\nexperts in blending in with their\nenvironment adapting themselves to the\npeople they're with to meet the specific\nsocial groups or people for instance\nthey can appear like an intellectual to\none person a prankster to another or a\nshy person to another friend by\nadjusting to the other person's\ncommunication style and preferences as a\nconsequence most people don't learn\nabout infj's genuine feelings and\nthoughts they only see a shadow of the\nreal INFJs leading them to perceive\nINFJs as fake INFJs can be more\nattractive by trying not to get along\nwith literally anyone I know I know this\nmay sound counter-intuitive but being\nauthentic and acting from a place of\nhonesty is far superior to acting from a\nplace of pretense\nentp entps like experimenting with ideas\nand bantering with others quick wit it\nentps use their Mastery of language to\ngain an advantage over others often\nplayfully teasing their behaviors and\nOddities\nbecause they frequently focus on the big\npicture they often forget important\ndetails about their loved ones such as\nbirthdays or anniversaries making their\nloved ones feel insignificant and EPS\nmay also become too engrossed in their\nConcepts and ideas that they lose track\nof the Urgent responsibilities around\nthem such as household chores and paying\nbills as a result people may perceive\nentities as irresponsible entps can be\nmore attractive by learning to\nprioritize what's important and weed out\nthose competing distractions looking at\nthe small pictures is necessary as the\nneglect of these small details may be\nthe cause of relationship breakdowns\nINTP intps possess a profound intellect\nbeneath their quiet exterior which they\nbring to any setting their rational\nquick thinkers and have a knack in\nanalyzing everything that they encounter\nfrom research data to the behavior of\nthe people around them however this\nRelentless quest for facts and\nobjectivity May often lead to impatience\nand an inclination to be judgmental and\ncritical towards those not as\nquick-witted as they are they're also\nnot sensitive to the emotional cues of\nothers which can become toxic in\nrelationships where rationality does not\nalways Prevail while emotional\nsensitivity and attentiveness may not\ncome easily to intps engaging in\nbehaviors that make others feel seen and\nheard will increase their capacity to\nempathize and relate to other people\nintps can increase their desirability if\nthey learn to be patient towards those\nwho may not have as formidable intellect\nas them ENFP\nenfps are enthusiastic Trailblazers they\nprefer spontaneity and refuse to get\nTethered to a routine since they are the\ngo with the flow type of people they\noften don't prepare or plan ahead of\ntime which may sometimes give off the\nimpression to those who are interested\nin them that their last minute additions\nto the enfp's plans enfps also greatly\ndesire external validation to make them\nfeel more confident in themselves enfps\nshould understand that not everyone\nprefers spontaneity in that even small\nplans can make their loved ones feel\nvalued enfp's attractiveness may be\nprominent if they strive to look more to\nthemselves for approval and worry less\nabout what others think\ninfp one of infp's key assets is empathy\nit may also poses a problem at times\nsince infps are prone to absorbing other\npeople's unpleasant emotions or views\nthey may sometimes become so overwhelmed\nthat they isolate themselves into their\ninner Sacred Space and shut everyone out\nthis can mean not responding to their\nfriends messages or calls failing to\nfollow through on plans and deleting all\ntheir social media accounts\nfor this reason it's important to learn\nto be aware of how these periods of deep\nemotion and processing may be pushing\nother people away\ntry to rise to the surface and\nexperience the world more frequently\nremember every person has their own\ndistinct taste it's impossible to be\nlike everyone however there is no need\nto be inflexible about your personality\nand you can become a more attractive\nversion of yourself by working on your\nflaws\npeople a chance to get to know you so\nyou can grow on them even if doing so\nmakes you feel susceptible to rejection\nso no matter how unappealing you think\nyou are\nthere's still so much room for growth in\nattracting the right person for you"
