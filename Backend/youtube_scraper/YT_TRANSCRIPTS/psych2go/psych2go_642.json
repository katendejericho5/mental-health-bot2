    "transcript": "[Music]\nhello psych2go viewers today we have a\nvery special guest the amazing Katie\nMorton as you guys probably already know\nKatie is a licensed therapist author and\npublic speaker who is well known for her\nYouTube channel Katie is a passionate\nadvocate for mental health and our\nchannel is dedicated to discussing a\nwide range of topics including anxiety\ndepression stress eating disorders\npsychological disorders and Trauma Katie\nis the author of two best-selling books\nare you okay a guide to caring for your\nmental health you guys can see it you\ncan traumatized identify understand and\ncope with PTSD and emotional stress\nKatie has become a leading voice in the\nmental health community and has inspired\nand uplifted so many viewers with her\ncontent which is why we're so honored to\nhave her as a guest today thank you for\njoining me Katie of course thanks for\nhaving me of course I'm so excited to\ndiscuss these topics especially since\nMay is mental health awareness month\nit's important to spread the message\nthat mental health matters to eliminate\nthe stigma around it so the topic for\ntoday is self-care self-care and mental\nhealth the definition of self-care\nvaries depending on who you ask but the\nofficial definition from the World\nHealth Organization defines it as the\nability of individuals families and\ncommunities to promote Health prevent\ndisease maintain Health cope with\nillness disability with or without the\nsupport of a health worker so I wanted\nto start out with this question for you\nwhat is the importance of self self-care\nand how does it positively positively\nimpact our Mental Health\nyeah self-care\nI kind of hate that it's become such a\nbuzzword because I think it's kind of\ngot this bad rep that it has to be\nexpensive or you have to spend a lot of\ntime but self-care overall I like to\nthink of it as like basic things I\nalways talk about the halt acronym\nhungry angry lonely tired those are\nthings to check in on and the reason\nthat this is so important is I mean just\nimagine like the word hangry exists for\na reason if I haven't eaten in like four\nhours you're not gonna get the best\nKatie I'm going to be more irritable and\nbe more short-tempered I'm going to be\nimpatient right there's a lot of ways\nthat just our basic self-care can affect\nhow we interact with the world therefore\nour mental health overall if I'm not\neating well day after day or I'm not\ngetting enough sleep day after day\nany any new parent anybody in school\nwill tell you that that lack of sleep\ncan really affect how you feel and how\nyou're able to engage with other people\nand so overall think of instead of\nself-care being like I have to go on\nvacation I have to get a massage wear a\nface mask things like that you can do\nthat stuff that's great but on the daily\nmore like did I drink enough water did I\nget enough sleep am I eating regularly\nall of that is going to be key and that\ncan what we call therapy the window of\ntolerance or it's your resilience your\nability to weather life storms\nif we're doing that self-care then that\nlevel of resilience is going to get\nhigher and we'll be able to manage the\nthings that we can't control right like\nlife\nexactly and a lot of people they feel\nlike self-care synonymous with luxury\nwhen in reality self-care should be and\nis accessible it's just relaxing it's\njust taking care of yourself your mental\nhealth it's not a luxury vacation to the\nBahamas right I mean it can be that's\nnot very sustainable right I can only\nexact location every I don't know 10\nyears or something but every day I'll\nmake sure that I drink water go for a\n15-minute walk something like that yeah\nand self-care is it self-care isn't\ntwice a year right it should be like at\nleast you know I guess it depends on\nmaybe once a month something like that\nyeah or I mean this that's why I like\nthe small things because it should be\nevery day you know there should be small\nthings we do for ourselves like are you\ntaking your medication as prescribed\nthat's self-care yeah it's yourself a\nnice meal that's self-care I'm looking\nat it from that standpoint can be kind\nof eye-opening and allow you to feel at\nleast for me instead of judging yourself\nand being like I never put my I don't do\nthis instead seeing like no I do do a\nlot of things to take care of myself and\nI am you know offering myself some\nself-care exactly and so you kind of\njust mentioned this but what are helpful\nforms of self-care and how do they\nmanage stress effectively\nyeah I think helpful forms can be\nanything like I just mentioned but also\nit could be\num venting to a friend I think that's\neffective too right we can do I talk\nabout body shakes a lot but when we feel\nkind of queued up energy it could be\nanxiety stress just feeling disregulated\nwe can do it Shake It Out stomp your\nfeet move around that can help you feel\nbetter there's a lot of like small easy\nways that we can improve our overall\nmental health by acknowledging\nthings aren't quite right or maybe I\nneed to step away from my desk for a\nlittle bit get outside you know if we\ncan do those small things for ourselves\noverall it's almost like we're building\na savings account right and so every\ntime you do something kind for yourself\nyou're like you know what I'm really\nstressed I'm gonna step away from my\ndesk I'm gonna go make myself a new\ncoffee or a new tea or whatever\ntake a breath all of that is just again\nbuilding up that resilience think of it\nlike throwing coins in a savings account\nso that when we have those days where we\nmaybe can't step away or things are\nextra stressful we can pull from that\nsavings account and we can weather that\nstorm we can be okay and so think of it\nin small ways that make you feel good\nmaybe it's taking in a little extra long\nshower maybe it's uh petting your dog\nmaybe it's going for a walk maybe it's I\ncall it doing things for future Katie\nlike future Katie might not have time to\nfold those towels I'm just going to do\nit now because I do have the time now\nand then future Katie's like yeah\nbecause I don't have to do it so I love\nthat in those ways yeah and you know a\nsevere lack of self-care causes burnout\nand so WebMD defines burnout as a form\nof exhaustion caused by constantly\nfeeling swamped it's a result of\nexcessive and prolonged emotional\nphysical and mental stress and it's\nusually related to different stressors\nsuch as work school or personal issues\nso how does one and identify burnout\nafter not really taking care of\nthemselves for a while\nyeah burnout it can appear a lot like\ndepression or anxiety when it goes\nuntreated it shows up like that and\nreally the reason burnout happens just\nso people kind of understand is when the\nreward that we get for something isn't\nat least commensurate meaning equal with\nthe effort we put in so that can shift\nover time right maybe\nthe money we were being compensated used\nto feel like a lot and now because\ninflation things are expensive it's\nharder or maybe we used to feel more\nfulfilled because we connected with\npeople and now we're not seeing as many\npeople and so that reward goes down\num and while we still sustain that\neffort and that's why burnout looks like\nirritability resentment a lot of people\nfeel like they resent their job or their\nplace in school or whatever volunteer\nwork anything you're doing being a\nstay-at-home parent that's a full-time\njob and we can start to be agitated and\nirritated that we have that you know job\nand so just notice if you are extra\nagitated extra irritable find yourself\njust like you get an email and you go oh\nlike it's just too much those I call\nthem overreactions not to judge them\noverreactions are helpful because it\ntells us something's wrong so if you\nfind yourself putting things off not\nwanting to get out of bed you know\nstruggling to stay focused getting\nagitated irritated resentful\nthose are some things to look out for\nand if they happen more days than not\nI would call it burnout because we can\nall have a bad day or maybe a couple\ndays you know because oath leading up to\nthis big project or this big\npresentation but if you find it\nhappening with more regularity it's\nsomething to you know look into yeah\nexactly and sometimes it's common for\npeople to push themselves despite\nfeeling burned out what are the\nconsequences of ignoring the clear signs\nthat you're feeling burnt out and why is\nit so detrimental to someone's Mental\nHealth\nyeah the we've all done it I'm just as\nguilty even though I know I'm burnt out\nright you can feel like deadlines don't\ngo away and that's why self-care is\nimportant finding small ways that you\ncan fit it into your schedule\num but when we continue to ignore it it\ndoes turn into depression or anxiety it\ncan turn into a mental illness and\nmeaning that it's gone from like what\nI'd call a situational issue meaning\nthings are happening I'm not taking care\nof myself I'm working harder the reward\nis less and now it's become an actual\ndiagnosable and treatable mental illness\nand now that's not to say\nthat burnout doesn't feel terrible and\nyou know and depression's way worse\nwe're not there's no way in measuring\nhere it's all not comfortable but what's\nhappening is then then it's going to\ntake us longer to essentially dig\nourselves out of that hole we're gonna\nmost likely need professional help at\nthat point versus oh I need to take a\nbreak and recharge\nexactly and I just wanted you to maybe\nemphasize this or explain it a little\nbit further how does Burnout exacerbate\nor even cause depression and anxiety\nyeah so not to get too nerdy but what\nhappens in our brain when we're burnt\nout is that our body can start to go\ninto fight flight freeze which is\notherwise known as our stress response\nan aptly named right stress response for\nstressed we're maxed out what happens\nwhen that stress response is triggered\nis that our amygdala and part of our\nlimbic system is ignited okay so it's\nactive now that polls are prefrontal\ncortex which I would call kind of like\nthe organized part of our brain or adult\nin our brain it pulls it offline and\nwhen this happens for really prolonged\nperiod of time it makes it even more\ndifficult for us to concentrate on\nthings or to plan out things in the\nfuture have organized thought and it\nmakes us extremely reactive because they\nfind the amygdala gets enlarged okay\nbecause it's it's essentially overactive\nagain not to get too nerdy but it's\nimportant to know because then\nif we aren't treating our burnout and\nit's just happening and happening and\nnow we find ourselves falling into\ndepression anxiety I actually find my\nburnout patients usually fall and more\nanxious than depressed at first and I\nthink it's part of that fight flight\nresponse\num but again it's going to take us\nlonger for that amygdala because it can\nshrink back down but it's going to take\nlonger essentially to undo that damage\nor that hyperactivity of that region in\nour brain and it will take us a little\nbit longer to come back online and so\noverall just know that though in general\nwhen it comes to our mental health the\nlonger we allow ourselves to feel bad\nthe longer it's going to take to dig\nourselves out just like a cold like your\nmental health is no different than your\nphysical health and if I have strep\nthroat which I used to get a ton as a\nkid terrible\num and I don't go to the doctor for\nlonger I'll feel worse longer right\nevery day that I don't see the doctor\nand get an antibiotic or whatever the\nlonger I'm going to be sick and your\nmental health is just same the longer I\ndon't talk about it get treated for it\nget some coping skills the longer I'm\ngoing to feel bad exactly and I mean so\nI think preventing it as much as\npossible helps because treat I mean\nobviously you should try to take care of\nyourself if you experience burning\nburnout but if you can prevent it it's\nbetter so what strategies can help\nprevent burnout and how does Burnout\ndeteriorate a person's physical health\nyeah so the ways to prevent burnout are\nto like we talked about engage in\nself-care regularly make time I mean\nevery day to do those basic things I was\ntalking about making sure you're eating\nregularly or drinking enough water\nyou're giving yourself an opportunity to\nget enough sleep I know sleep can be\ndifficult that's a whole other\nconversation but make sure you're in bed\nfor at least seven and a half hours okay\nso those are some of the basic things we\ncan do to prepare\nalso another thing that I would\nencourage everybody to do is when you\nnotice yourself because this happens to\nme like I'll be like at my computer and\nI'm focused and I'm trying to put\ntogether this video and it's just not\ncoming to me and I feel like I'm like\npushing myself and forcing myself to\nwork through it what if instead\nI took a step away and I did something I\nlove like I played with my dog I went\nfor a quick walk I listened to some\nfunny music and dance around the house\nor I called a friend those are all\nthings that we can do\ninstead of pushing through kind of that\nfeeling that we're already having of\nfeeling stuck feeling agitated\ntaking some action then is going to\nprevent it from prolonging it'd be like\nwhen my throat first starts to hurt I\ncall the doctor and I get in more\nquickly right we just start enacting\nsome of these tools and these techniques\nthat can help us feel better more\nquickly now when it comes to physical\nhealth the way that burnout can affect\nthat\nis essentially what we would call\nsymptoms of depression or anxiety right\nit can affect my appetite so I can feel\nextra hungry I can find myself binge\neating at night\num I can also find myself not hungry\nlike I have no appetite it's just we\ncall it changes in appetite because\neverybody's different\num we can also find ourselves to be this\nis not physical but it's important to\nmention is really impulsive so when\nwe're feeling burnt out we can find\nourselves wanting to like spend like\nshop like Amazon orders coming in hot\nfor no reason things we don't even need\num you know spending more money than we\nprobably should and we can also make\nimpulsive decisions in other parts of\nour life maybe I don't know decide to go\nout with that person again when we\nreally don't like them or yeah I'll take\nthat trip I'll buy that thing or\nwhatever it's we can just be more quick\nand not put again prefrontal cortexes\noffline right we're not very organized\num but then physical health stuff um\nsleep can become more difficult so it's\nessentially like if we aren't taking\ncare of it up front it gets harder and\nharder to take care of it right appetite\nchanges sleep disturbances uh body aches\nwe can actually be more predisposed to\ncatch a cold and get sick because our\nimmune system gets depleted when we're\nnot taking care of ourselves\num essentially our mental health and our\nphysical health are like inextricably\nlinked and if we're not paying attention\nto how we feel we're going to feel it in\nour bodies and that that's honestly why\na lot of my depressed patients will show\nup at their doctor's office first\nthinking they've caught the flu or\nsomething because they just they're like\nI just can't concentrate I feel super\ntired I ache it's hard to get out of bed\nI don't have an appetite all those\nthings we might think could be a cold\nbut it could also be a sign of\ndepression or anxiety\nexactly so do you feel like in a lot of\nways severe burnout could lead to like a\nmental breakdown\nyes um I've seen it happen in a couple\nof instances\nluckily I it's not as incredibly common\nas I think it could be\nbut if we don't take care of ourselves\nslowly like for instance a good example\nwould be I forget the exact amount of\ndays I think it's three or four but the\nNavy Seals they put the the people\ntrying to become a Navy SEAL through\nthese rigorous studies and uh challenges\nand one of them is like to not sleep\nsleep deprivation\nand they actually start to show signs of\npsychosis\nso that means it's after like three or\nfour days I'd have to look up the exact\nthey haven't in hours but it's like\nseven let's say 78 hours or something\nand that just goes to show you how\nimportant those like you know what we\ncall like basic self-care is if we're\nnot eating regular if we're not getting\nenough sleep we can start to D get\nderailed and think of uh that resilience\nI was talking about or that window of\nTolerance that ability to weather life\nstorms If It's Getting Thinner and\nthinner then we can be\nuh on our way to work and someone cuts\nus off in traffic and we cannot manage\nthat upset we could start screaming we\ncould start crying we'd have to pull the\ncar over we could get into an accident\nyou know things I know that sounds\nreally extreme but it's not that far off\nif we're not taking care of ourselves we\ncan't weather that we we think of all\nthe things that can happen in our life\nthey get our order wrong at the coffee\nshop or we wake up and we're late\nalready we didn't realize our alarm's\nbeen going off there's a million the hot\nwater's out you know there's a million\nthings that can happen between getting\nup and getting to work or school and in\nthat time if we don't have any ability\nto weather that we can\nwhat I would just say is like become\ncompletely disregulated meaning tearful\nangry essentially being like run by\nthese wild ups and downs of our emotions\nbecause we don't have that bank account\nto pull from to be like it's going to be\nokay we got this yeah exactly it's like\nthat person you know like what you\nmentioned in the coffee shop was going\ncrazy about their the wrong order and\nit's usually never about the coffee\nso much deeper that's like the straw\nthat broke the camel's back you know\nthere's like 55 other things that\nhappened and they just can't can't\nhandle it exactly and so I wanted to\njump to this what are some\nmisconceptions about mental health and\nself-care that perpetuate stigmas around\nmental health treatment\nI think anything that first of all for\nself-care anything that tells you it has\nto cause it's a great marketing Ploy but\nanything tells you has to cost a lot of\nmoney\nI think just perpetuates the like lack\nof accessibility to proper self-care and\nI'm here to tell you that it doesn't\nhave to cost you a dime it should be\neasy should be something that you can do\nlike I said just fill up your water\nglass and think this is part of my\nself-care I'm going to take a minute I'm\ngonna breathe and drink this that's all\nit doesn't have to cost a lot um and\nwhen it comes to mental health in\ngeneral I think talking about\num mental health issues as if they mean\nthat something's wrong with you that\nyou're like broken and unfixable I think\nthat perpetuates stigma I think false\ninformation I know there's\num\ngaslighting is like this new term that\neverybody's using I mean it's been\naround for ages but it's very popular\nright now and uh narcissism everybody's\na narcissist everybody's love walking\nand I think sometimes it's good because\nthen we're talking about it and we're\nyou know acknowledging that the these\nthings to be painful and abusive and I'm\nnot saying that people aren't harmed by\nnarcissists I'm just saying that when we\ndisagree with someone about the way\nsomething took place that isn't\nnecessarily gaslighting and that doesn't\nmean they're a narcissist you know\nusually this is done with malicious\nintent and so I bring up that example to\nsay that if we're not sharing correct\ninformation then we are perpetuating\nmisinformation and potentially stigmas\nassuming that you know depression always\nlooks like a person that can't get out\nof bed when I'm here to tell you that\nthe person next to you at work could be\ndepressed but they get up and they're\nable to get to work but they're just\nbarely hanging on we just don't know\nthey're really good at masking and to\nmake these assumptions and to perpetuate\nthat I think does a disservice and is\nstigmatizing to mental health overall\nexactly like that notion that you have\nto pretend that everything's okay when\nyou're not exactly and in your book are\nyou okay you mentioned that one in six\nadults is affected by a mental illness\nand yet only 50 seek mental health\ntreatment as a mental health\nprofessional what do you feel like\npeople struggle with the most when\nthey're first seeking treatment for\ntheir mental health and what can be done\nto change it so others feel more\ncomfortable seeking help yeah I think\nthere's like two parts uh first is the\ncost\num the fact that not a lot of even\npersonally my mental health care I see a\ntherapist she's not covered by my\ninsurance uh they don't cover my I have\na copay like seven thousand dollars\nit's like when am I gonna meet that so I\nthink coverage needs to improve as well\nand that it's like goes with\naccessibility right\none of the Silver Linings of covet is\nthat online therapy is available it's\nusually a little bit cheaper\num and there are tiers or levels\ndepending on what you can pay so I think\nthat's kind of its own piece to it and I\nthink we need to improve the way that we\ncan afford it and make it more\naccessible to people but then on the\nflip side if you find yourself like in\nan you have the ability to see someone\nyou have the ability to afford it\nwhether it's through insurance or on\nyour own\npeople don't really know what to look\nfor right I think sometimes we assume\nunfortunately that when we see a\nprofessional of any kind a dentist a\ndoctor\na therapist we automatically assume that\nbecause they have the degree that\nthey're always right\nand I'm here to tell you yes I have an\neducation but you're the expert on you\nand so make sure that your reaction your\ngut response to this person is a good\none you know how we meet people and the\nfirst time you're like I don't I don't\nknow why but I like them right we can\njust get that Vibe you know I just like\nthat person you know later we'll be like\nthat that new friend I really liked him\nor her you know we can have that kind of\nfeeling you should have that with your\ntherapist you it's not a comfortable\nsituation so to say you should feel\ncomfortable is not true it's weird to\ntalk and cry to a stranger I'll admit it\nI do it too\num but I know it's like bizarre\num but if you find someone you connect\nwith we find that that is actually the\nkey ingredient to therapy working it's\nnot about I mean part of it could be\nlike my specialty but that's actually\nnot as important as the fact that you\nfeel seen and heard and connected with\nyour therapist so make sure you trust\nthat gut reaction do a phone\nconsultation patient if they do\nin-person consultations do that first\ntoo I went through I think 10 before I\npicked the therapist I'm with now so\ndon't feel like you have to settle this\nis your treatment you should feel\ncomfortable\num and in my book are you okay and even\non my channel I have videos with more\ndetails about how to know if you're\nseeing a good therapist or a bad\ntherapist there are things we should be\naware of but in short just make sure you\nfeel comfortable and you feel like they\nhear you they see you\nthank you so much for that and now we're\ngoing to move to audience questions\nthere's a lot in here we have almost 300\npeople in here so um someone asked how\nshould what what um signs indicate that\nI should receive therapy\nif honestly the number one and the one\nthat I've always I'll say over and over\nagain is difficulty and functionality\nand what I mean by that is are you\nstruggling to do what you used to do\nwith ease is it hard to show up for your\nfriends or your family is it hard to\nconcentrate at work or school\num like for me I'll tell you how I know\nI need to get back in therapy because\nI've been in and out since I was 15 and\nI'll be 40 this year so it's been a long\na long haul\num is I'll be extra tearful I can like\njust cry watching the commercial or\nsomething I'm just like extra emotional\nso just notice if if things in life are\nmore difficult it's harder to sleep it's\nharder to to eat regularly you know if\nany of that is difficult for you I think\nit's time to reach out for help and I\nhonestly believe we should all be in\ntherapy I think for for whatever reason\nwe've always assumed that something must\nbe like quote unquote wrong with us for\nus to seek help and the sooner the\nbetter it's so much easier to dig\nourselves out of that hole when it's\njust a tiny little hole versus you know\nif it's been like 40 years and we\nhaven't talked to anybody\nexactly and Drew asked so this is\nanother question direct is it important\nfor men to talk about their mental\nhealth yes I'd argue I mean not even\nmore than women but yes because I think\nthere's an increased stigma it at least\nso I was raised in a really small town\nvery country small town and my papa\nwould have said that like you know men\nare stoic and don't show emotion and\nthat they're still generational like you\nknow it's like these\nI don't know if it's just like a\nsocietal belief or if it's generational\ntrauma that we're kind of sharing but\neither way I feel like there's sometimes\nthere's pressure on men and women alike\nsometimes to like put up a tough front\nand pretend that things don't upset us\nwe're all human we're all in this world\nand we can all struggle mental illnesses\ndon't care what you look like where\nyou're from any of that that affects us\nall at the same rate so yes please speak\nup I think if you feel comfortable\nspeaking publicly even I would love to\nsee you know more men talking about\nmental health so that other men know\nit's like leading by example so others\nknow that it's okay too\nexactly\num it's it's always okay does it matter\nwhat your pronouns are right\nand so someone asked and this is more of\na personal question but I think some\nsome people kind of have specific\nquestions like this and it's helpful so\nthis person asks I have been diagnosed\nwith ADHD and ever since I started\ntaking my ADHD medications I've realized\nI've been feeling so lazy burnt out and\ndepressed do you think this is because\nof the medication\nI would talk to your psychiatrist about\nthat\num it's interesting okay so I'm not a\ndoctor but I'll tell you what I know I\nhave a lot of patients with ADHD who\nhave been put on a stimulant now I don't\nknow what type of medication you've been\nput on for your ADHD but this would be\nsomething like a ritalin now they've\nbeen put on a ritalin type of medication\nand it's helped with their depressive\nsymptoms\nnow I know that's awful they call it off\nlabel use but we do find sometimes when\nwe're treating the ADHD it also treats\nunderlying symptoms like depression so\nthe fact that your symptoms are getting\nworse with this type of treatment let\nyour psychiatrist know because the on\nthe therapist side I would always want\nto say\num hey maybe we're misdiagnosed or maybe\nthis medication just does not set sit\nwell with me\num speak up let them know you're having\nthis I'd call it like a side effect\nalmost let them know that this is making\nthings worse so they can change your\nmedication or shift and find something\nthat makes you feel better because\nthat's what medication should do we\nshould start to slowly but surely feel\nthe symptoms lift exactly what you just\nmentioned is mental health empowerment\nlike if something isn't working speak up\nlike don't just sit there idly and just\nallow that you know to happen because\nyour mental health is important and this\nis you know they're the therapists and\nthe doctors are there to help you\nexactly feel bad about it 100 and no one\nwill advocate for you as much as you\nwill I know it sucks and it's hard\nsometimes to speak up but they're there\nto help you and that's your time and\nyour payment also so your next\nappointment or if you can call right now\nor email you know make sure you get your\nquestions answered and if you get\nnervous because I even just like my mind\ngoes blank put notes in on your phone\nand just read through them\num and you know you can even ask if you\ncan record their answers some doctors\nwill let you do that too so that you\ndon't have to remember it if you find\nfind yourself feeling overwhelmed\nexactly and then Brian asks what do you\ndo when you have two therapists and you\ndon't feel like you're getting better\njust staying stuck in the same place and\nyour depression just continues hmm\num a couple of thoughts we might want to\ntry so Random I learned this when I was\nresearching for my book traumatized that\nand this is specific to trauma but I\nwould argue it applies to all mental\nillnesses that only 40 of people are\nhelped by talk therapy alone now what I\nmean by talk therapy is that I'm just\nI'm I'm listening to you I'm offering\nmaybe tools and techniques and we're\njust talking it out\nother types of therapy that are not talk\nbased would be things like somatic-based\ntherapy which is like movement remember\nI talked about that body shake well if\nwe are holding anxiety or trauma in our\nbodies to think about the instance that\nhas brought that about and move can be\nreally healing we can also do EMDR which\nis like uh without getting into it too\nmuch it stands for eye movement\ndesensitization and reprocessing and we\nkind of cause what's called bilateral\nstimulation it can be through tapping it\ncan be through following something we're\ntrying to stimulate the parts of our\nbrain again to allow our brain another\nopportunity to process the upset\nthose are just two of many examples and\nso it might behoove you to look into\nthose other options because maybe the\ntherapies you're getting just even if\nyou love your therapist it just might\nnot be the right fit in what you need\nanother thought that I had is that if\nyou're not on medication you might want\nto look into that I know that some\npeople can be very adverse to even\nconsidering medication but I'm here to\ntell you it's there for a reason and\nit's like a life raft I like to think of\nit that if we're drowning in our\nsymptoms like you said I'm still feeling\nbad and I'm going into therapy and I'm\ntrying all this stuff if I can't\nparticipate fully and I'm not feeling\nany Improvement allow medication to be\nthat life raft that float that pulls you\nup and helps you better you know maybe\ndo the homework that your therapist is\ngiving you or be able to better\ncommunicate about what's really going on\nso that you can feel better overall\nexactly and then so zanz asked how\nshould we treat intrusive thoughts due\nto burnout\nyeah intrusive thoughts are interesting\nwe used to think that if you just like\nsaid stop stop stop stop stop or try to\nfight them that they got better that's\nactually research shows that doesn't\nmake it better so I'm sorry I probably\ngave that advice like six seven years\nago before this research came out\num but we find\num that the best way to manage intrusive\nthoughts is to actually acknowledge them\nokay just hang with me I know you're\nlike but they're uncomfortable and\nthey're really mean and they're like\nbullies I hear you\nacknowledge it call it what it is this\nis an intrusive thought it's not helpful\nI and then check your facts if that's\nnot enough check your facts this\nactually isn't how I feel or this isn't\nyou know supported with the evidence I\nhave right because an intrusive thought\ncan be like uh this isn't you're you're\nnot even worthwhile this is stupid\nyou're so lazy or why don't you go throw\nyourself off a bridge right intrusive\nthoughts tend to be violent or sexual in\nnature I know that's why they're so\nuncomfortable but allow yourself to just\nacknowledge it\nand it will go away that's the magic the\nmore we fight it the worse it gets\nanother trick that I use if it's like\nintrusive thoughts just keep coming up\nand it's almost like if I don't feel\nlike anything I'm doing is helping I'll\nforce myself to think of a good memory\npick a memory that's like really like\npalpable like you can still feel it you\ncan still smell wherever you were and\nthen imagine that you're telling me or\nsomeone who doesn't know anything about\nit all about that memory where were you\nwhat were you wearing what did you what\ndo you use all your senses would you\nsmell would you taste did you feel your\nclothing on your back was the sun on\nyour face like tell me all about that\nmemory in that practice of like pulling\nour brain into something that's really\nemotionally charged it usually lets go\nof that kind of anxiety-based intrusive\nthought it's a really good strategy\nactually like visualizing something\npositive and then it can help the\nintrusive thoughts go away and so we'll\nask how do you know if your burnout is\ncaused by repressed trauma\num\nif we find the symptoms that we're\nexperiencing coming up like if we can\nidentify a pattern of triggers because\nwhen something is trauma based and\nI'll tell you this but then I'll tell\nyou if you can't even get to this point\nwhat we can do too because I know I\nmight be already ahead of some people if\nthey're like I don't even know where\nit's coming from but just hang with me\nif we are able to identify the triggers\nand let's say we find our symptoms of\nburnout coming up whenever we are\nreprimanded by our boss and then I want\nyou to consider you know did this happen\nwhen I was younger is there a way that I\nwas like bullied or abused from someone\nwho was you know in a position of power\nthis could be a parent teacher coach you\nknow like I said bully a kid at school\nany number of things can we attach the\ntriggers now to potential past upsets\nokay because we might not identify them\nas traumas yet even though they were\nso just consider and see if you can draw\nthat correlation now if you're in the\ncamp because a lot of my community is as\nwell where they're like I don't even\nknow I just feel really overwhelmed all\nthe time then the best way to actually\nfigure this out is to see a therapist\nwho specializes in trauma now when a\ntherapist says they specialize in trauma\nthat doesn't mean that if you don't end\nup having a trauma that you want to work\non that they can't help you this just\nmeans that if you do they understand how\nto get you there so I would I would\nreach out and talk to someone because\nthey're they're going to have to work\nwith you to help you better identify\nthose triggers and realize where this\ncould be connected to because they'll be\nable to guide you through it more slowly\nwithout overwhelming you because the one\nthing we don't want to do when we're\nthinking about trauma is feel like we\nhave to understand it all and talk\nthrough it really quickly because that\ncan actually re-traumatize us and so we\nmight just want to go more slowly does\nthat make sense well that makes sense\nand so then cat asked how can we deal\nwith persistent sleeping problems due to\nburnout ooh yeah\num create a ritual around your bed and\nsleep and there's a lot of cognitive\nbehavioral techniques or CBT techniques\nthat can help with this first is\ncleaning up your sleep hygiene and my\naudience hated this but I'm just going\nto tell you no pets in your bed at least\nfor a while I know\nI know and I love my dog also I I hear\nyou but they move around they disrupt us\nwhether we realize it or not okay so no\nanimals in the bed no extra stimuli no\nphone in bed I know you you hate it too\nI hate it okay but that's part of sleep\nhygiene\nand then creating a ritual so what do we\nwant to do at what time leading up to\nsleep and this doesn't matter if it's\nweekday or weekend we need to keep\nroughly the same schedule does that mean\nthat at 10 30 we start this process okay\nI fill up my water I wash my face I\nbrush my teeth I take out my contacts\nyou know whatever it is that you do do\nyour process and let's say you're like\nbut I do like being on my phone okay\nmaybe we'll go back in the living room\nwe're on our phone for a little bit\nthen we make our way to bed and we start\nunwinding and we need to have this\nritual or this routine every day leading\nup to it because and it sounds silly but\nwe do it with kids and then we stop as\nadults rituals prepare our brain and\nbody for what's about to happen and so\nour brain and body are like oh I know\nthis we're about to go to bed this is\ntime for Sleep your brain starts to\nrelease melatonin you start to kind of\nrelax you start to maybe feel cold\nbecause your body's like slowing down\nthings\nand then we're able to sleep better and\nso start that ritual\nand start like cleaning up your sleep\nhygiene and regardless of even if it's\nburnout created or regular sleep issues\nit will improve and I have an old video\ntoo if you want to look up on my channel\ncalled just look up sleep Katie Morton\nit'll come up I think it's like four or\nfive years old but it still Rings true\nyeah I agree with you I mean you can\nalso let your phone charge while you're\nsleeping and that helps and I think your\nsleep is obviously enhanced when you\nhave your phone away from you yeah I\nmean I like to watch Tick Tock at night\njust like anybody else yeah\nor psych to go yes exactly binge\nwatching section playlist a very long\nplaylist exactly\num so I think his name is Dak okay um he\nasked what are some non-medicinal\nproducts we can take to control in\nanxiety symptoms due to burnout if you\nhad any recommendations yeah I'll tell\nyou what I use personally because I'm\nnot a doctor so talk to your doctor\nbefore adding any supplements\nI find at night I take magnesium\nto help me calm down and go to sleep now\nI am more of the anxious type of person\nso like at night my brain can drag me\nthrough like all the embarrassing things\nI've said in my life which is just so\nmuch fun\num and it makes it really hard to go to\nsleep and magnesium has been really\ncalming and helpful we actually find um\nI talked to one of my friends who's a\nneuroscientist at Stanford Dr Ben Ryan\num melatonin is not good for us and it\nactually impairs our sleep when we add\nit it has to be naturally derived your\nbrain releases what it needs naturally\nare you wait I was literally about to\nask that so you don't recommend\nmelatonin I don't and I used to because\nI've used it but it's a hormone that our\nbody produces and essentially we\nshouldn't be forcing more into it it's\nnot good and it can impair the quality\nof our sleep we might fall asleep really\nquickly but it can cause very strange\ndreams and make us wake up like\nperiodically and then we wake up groggy\nbecause our brain has way more than it\nneeded and so yeah I I learned that too\nthat was probably like last year so it's\nnew to me\num but melatonin is not good l-theanine\nis what he recommended as well as\nmagnesium and even apogen those are all\nagain talk to your doctor because these\nare over-the-counter supplements\num but I personally found magnesium\nthere's Calm tea I get on Amazon that's\nbeen really helpful for me for me lemon\nand ginger tea helps yeah like a\nchamomile tea right like an herbal\nnon-caffeinated yeah I'm not sure if\nyou've heard of this and I'm just like\nasking for myself but have you heard of\nRescue Remedy it's like these little\ndrops\num I have to I have to remember what is\nin them but I think as long as it's not\nmelatonin I would say if it works for\nyou give it a try I've seen that little\nlike tincture like the little dropper\nright\num yeah I've seen it at homeopathic\nstores and stuff so yeah as long as\nthere's not melatonin in it I don't\nthink there's any harm obviously if\nyou're on medication check with your\ndoctor a good app to download is\ndrugs.com\nI know it sounds very hardcore but\nessentially put in any medication that\nyou're on even over-the-counter\nmedication because then you'll find out\nif anything like works against or\ntogether\num so that we can kind of mitigate any\nany side effects like I had a member of\nmy community who didn't think about the\nfact that she was on an SSRI like an\nantidepressant and she was taking cold\nmedicine because she was sick and she\nhad to work and she was taking so much\nof it she pushed herself into serotonin\nsyndrome which is really scary and can\nactually kill you\num but she didn't know and because her\ndog obviously her doctor didn't know oh\nyou're taking this type of medicine\num so just be careful and look look up\nthat stuff that's why we always say ask\na doctor it's not just to cover our own\nbutts it's also because we want to make\nsure you're okay\nexactly and then this is going to be the\nlast question by Sora he asked how to\nhow do you deal with procrastination\nthat's caused by burnout\num\nto be truthful the more we fight it the\nworse it's going to get so my best\nadvice is to structure your time in a\nway that feels better okay and what I\nmean by that is we need to set breaks\nsizable breaks like every 45 minutes of\nwork you need about 20 30 minutes of\ndown time and I'd encourage you to this\nis going to sound really silly but just\nhang with me I'd encourage you to try\nsomething that feels childlike and fun\nlike goofy\num like putting on silly music dancing\naround your living room I know you might\nnot like that I'm just throwing that out\nthere maybe that means that we color\nmaybe we watch a silly cartoon we used\nto love as a kid\num I know that this sounds kind of weird\nbut we find when we're super burnt out\nand we we just almost can't anymore the\nprocrastination is really heavy the\nmotivation is low that we need to let\nit's gonna sound woo-woo but just there\nis science to back it up we need to let\nthat inner child of us kind of play a\nlittle because we haven't we've kind of\nlike stuffed them down and forced them\nto do work which is if you think about\nis kind of why the symptoms of burnout\nare almost like child tantramine right\nwe're like agitated and we're irriting\nwe're like no we just don't wanna it's\nlike we're stomping our feet we're\nthrowing a fit\num and so allow for some of that joy and\nthat goofiness something that feels like\ntotally irresponsible in some ways we're\nlike I'm an adult adults don't do this\nthat's what we want you to do as long as\nit doesn't hurt anybody have some have\nsome fun put on something goofy do\nsomething funny and it's weird but\nyou'll see it happen after doing this a\ncouple times you'll start to feel that\nprocrastination just Wane and you'll be\nable to get what you need to get done\nbecause we've let ourselves kind of\nbe irresponsible for a little bit\nlike a release kind of yeah it is\nversus like white knuckling like forcing\nourselves in yeah into a situation they\nsay that when you force something it\njust kind of makes it worse right so it\ndoesn't have this work either because\nwe're not thinking our best\nso thank you for that Katie's were\nawesome questions so thank you to the\naudience as well and so I just wanted to\nask a few questions that pertain to\nmental health awareness month and so how\ncan we Empower others to seek help when\nneeded\nyeah the best thing we can do when it\ncomes to someone else that we love is to\nsupport and check in I know we want them\nto get help and we want them to get\nbetter we can't make anybody do anything\nall we can do is should we could share\nour own story hey I've been in therapy\nand I found that really helpful you know\nif they're coming to you again with like\noh I feel so depressed or I'm feeling\nthis way or that way we can say you know\nI know you're not really keen on therapy\nbut it was helpful for me and you can\njust share your story\nwe can support positive actions if\nthey're like I think I'm going to look\ninto a therapist be like if you want any\nhelp with that I'm here right we just we\njust offer our support\num and then just checking in I've heard\ntime and time again from my patients and\nmy viewers alike that when people come\nand try to fix it it feels worse it's\nbetter when someone just says Hey what\nif I picked up pizza and came over I've\nbeen wanting to watch this movie it's on\nNetflix you know and we just do that\nwe're just there that that's actually\nthe most helpful and so those are really\nthe ways you can support I know it sucks\nto feel like you can't do anything but\nthis is the way that you can help yeah\nexactly and then what is your best\nself-care advice for someone struggling\nwith mental health issues\nto top it off yeah my best self-care\nadvice take a shower I know that sounds\ncrazy but it's a life changer sometimes\nit's like you feel dirty inside and\noutside and let's just it's like a reset\nand um you know it's okay to take a\nlittle longer one to enjoy if you take a\nbath take a bath if you have the luxury\nof having a bath\num yeah I just feel like something about\nit is like rebirth Anew so take a shower\nand you tell me does it help because I\nthink it can change your life sometimes\nso helps a hot shower right exactly\nexactly well thank you so much Katie we\nreally appreciate you being here\num so you guys want to check if you guys\nwant to check out Kitty Morton's YouTube\nchannel it's in the description her\nwebsite and her book it's an amazing\nread I really
