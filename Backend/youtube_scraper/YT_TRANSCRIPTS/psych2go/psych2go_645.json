reality TV shows\nmovies and celebrities Dr Colorado Rossi\nis also a licensed psychologist with an\nM.A in marriage and family therapy from\nthe University of Southern California\nand a PhD in counseling psychology from\nthe University of Denver Dr Colorado\nalso works as a corporate psychologist\nconsultant and executive coach welcome\nDavid thank you so much for joining me\ntoday thank you for having me that was a\nvery good intro I appreciate it of\ncourse I'm so excited no of course yeah\nand I'm such a huge fan of the channel I\nthink that you're doing amazing work so\nthank you\nthank you and I'm excited to discuss the\ntopic which is psychology of celebrity\nWorship in the age of social media the\ninternet and social media has become so\ningrained in our daily lives and it's\nreally changed the way we view others\nespecially celebrities the internet and\nsocial media have made it so much easier\nto take a glimpse into their lives and\nfor many people they feel like they\nalmost know their favorite or not so\nfavorite celebrities on a personal level\nso first off my question for you is what\ndo you think are some of the\npsychological reasons why people become\nso emotionally attached to celebrities\neven though they've never met them\nbefore and what do you think is the\nimplication of this\nI think it's a I think it's a good\nquestion so\num\nI think there's a lot of implications\nfrom a psychological standpoint I think\nit's the perception of vulnerability so\nI think that the celebrities that are\nthe stickiest as far as having an\naudience and people wanting to listen to\nthem and follow them and the people that\nyou really connect to I think there's\nthe perception that they are being\ntransparent about their life their lives\nand I think that that is\nyou know if you think about anybody you\nhave a close relationship with it's\nalways because at some level because of\nvulnerability either they share a lot\nabout themselves either you've been\nthrough something serious or you have\nhistory all of which sort of at the end\nof the day is transparency and\nvulnerability and it was social media uh\npeople are able to share\nwhat they want about their lives but\nthey share it in a way that comes across\nas transparent and like like think about\nthe Kardashians or Vanderpump Rules or\nany of those like the they're clearly\nhighly produced but the perception is\nthat you're really getting a unique view\ninto this person's life and I think that\nthe fact that there's that vulnerability\nthere that's that's why it's sticky\nthat's why people are interested\ndoes that make sense yeah like they can\nconnect with that it's relatable it\nresonates yes yes and I think from a\npsychological standpoint there's a lot\nof reasons why we are interested in that\nyou know if you think about a much\nsmaller Society if you were if we were a\ngroup of 20 people it's really important\nthat we know everybody that we live with\nright but if you go back years and years\nand years and we're we're in a tribe\nit's important for us to know within our\ntribe or our clan who are who is\neverybody and it's it would be a social\nskill or a skill for survival to be able\nto listen to people be interested in\npeople and learn about them and their\nintentions so I think we are like from\nan evolutionary standpoint built to be\ngossipy in that way yeah and now it\ndoesn't serve us as well but now it you\nknow it shows up in Vanderpump Rules and\nwe want to learn everything we can about\nthe different times you know what I'm\nsaying right scandal\n[Laughter]\nmirrors don't due to social media the\nconcept of celebrity has been redefined\nin the past qualifying as a celebrity\nusually meant being an actor an actress\nmusician an athlete or a super famous\npolitician so it's definitely changed in\nrecent years however we're living in an\nage where social media has made it\npossible for anyone to be a celebrity or\na social media influencer in many ways\npeople aren't just obsessed with\ncelebrities anymore they are obsessed\nwith becoming a celebrity so looking at\nit from both sides in what ways is that\nsomething positive and in what ways is\nit destructive especially as it pertains\nto a person's Mental Health\nyeah that's that's a big question so I I\nand the first question I didn't answer\nwhat's the implication of that and I\nthink it ties into your second question\nwhich is I I think that\nour obsession with celebrity can cause\nis it can be negative in the sense that\nyou everything is so artificial so\nobviously it's easy to create an\nunrealistic standard of existence and I\nthink that that puts a lot of pressure\non the viewer on the audience I I also\nthink that it\num I think and this fits with your\nsecond question here when anybody can be\na celebrity When anybody has a\nmicrophone when anybody is listened to\num it's not always easy to vet your sort\nof circle you've probably heard that you\nare whatever the saying is you are the\nsum of the five people you hang out with\nmost and I think in some ways that's a\nreally it's really beneficial if you are\num you know if you are a disenfranchised\nindividual and you can go on and you can\nfind people that motivate you people\nthat who inspire you people that you can\nbe like and you work towards that then\nit's wonderful but if you pick the wrong\nperson because you're not really able to\nvet\nthese five people now that are all you\nknow virtual then I think it can derail\npeople's psychological development in a\nreally significant way so the example I\nwould give would be the Kardashians\num\nthey are obvious people they're\nobviously very entertaining people want\nto watch them but if you look at their\nindividual lives if I said would you\nwant to be Khloe Kardashian and\neverything that she's been through every\nher sort of psychological well-being\nright I think a lot of people would say\nI I don't I don't want the the\ninfidelity I don't want the divorces I\ndon't want the body image issues I don't\nwant the right I don't want to I don't\nwant I don't want a lot of things\nright but we but we're listening we're\nlistening to that content I think it can\ndistort how we see ourselves and how we\nshow up\nthat was a long-winded answer does that\nmake sense no that completely that makes\nsense like people kind of want the the\nglamor but they don't really want all\nthe baggage that does come with being\nfamous yeah and I don't know that\nbecause people can control what's\nwhat they put on the internet especially\nuh people have the resources to do so\num they can paint a really unfair\npicture of what's actually happening\nexactly like it can be manipulated yeah\nso as I mentioned earlier famous\ncelebrity has been redefined by the\npresence of social media if someone goes\nviral even if it's for something\nterrible they can become a celebrity\novernight lately there's been a trend of\ngiving significant media attention to\ncon artists and controversial figures\nsuch as the tindler swindler and adelvey\nElizabeth Holmes and so many others in a\nsense due to celebrity worship do you\nthink that the media tends to\nunintentionally reward these individuals\nwho commit atrocious acts such as making\nNetflix documentaries about them and so\non I mean for example annadelby got paid\nfor the recent Netflix documentary that\nwas made about her so do you think that\nthis almost enables and emboldens them\nuh I would never have thought about it\nthat way until you said that but but\nyeah you know I think the media does a\nmajor disservice if you think about\nschool shootings and they've changed a\nlittle bit where they're slower to put\nto put people's names out there\num but still\nif\nif people don't have a strong sense of\nself and they're just looking for some\namount of attention they're looking to\nhave some kind of impact on the world\nit's easier in many ways to do that if\nyou are provocative\nright you you are like I think a good\nexample would be and I don't mean it in\na negative way but like Jake Paul is the\none that I think about who has I think\nharnessed\nvirality in a really empowering and\nimpactful way for him but what he does\nis just be super super provocative I\ncould go out right now and do something\nvery extreme and I'm gonna get media\nattention and if I know how to do that\nin a way that keeps me out of jail\nI'm gonna keep getting more and more\npopular and so I do think that there's\nless attention being give given to\npeople that are making good decisions\nthat are thoughtful that are nuanced\num and so yeah I think it probably does\nempower people to\nsort of\num pursue Fame in any way right and I\nthink that that\nyeah I think that's probably a problem I\nhadn't really thought about it until you\nsaid it\nyeah like it just um yeah go ahead sorry\ndid you I just try to interrupt you did\nyou um\ndid you watch there was a show on\nNetflix called the most hated man on the\ninternet\nit was the this guy named Hunter I can't\nremember what his name was I did I did a\nreaction video to him it was the revenge\nporn guy\nI think I've heard of it um I think I\nthink I've heard of it yeah\nso it so this guy starts this website\ncalled\nI forget what I I don't know what the\nwebsite is but he created some website\nwhere people could go on there and put\nnude pictures of their exes on there and\nhe became exceptionally popular for\ndoing this and he's absolutely violating\nthe rights of all of these people whose\npictures are on the internet this\nNetflix documentary comes out I do\nreaction video and then people start\ncontacting me like they got my phone\nnumber and reached out and go he's still\ndoing it going to they go into Discord\nthere's a whole Discord group around it\nand there's this audience of people that\ncould watch the documentary that could\nbe I think was called up all night or\nsomething was the website but could\nwatch this see this horrific thing\nhappening and they and they're\nvalidating of it and and they want to be\na part of it and it's Fringe enough that\nthey're diving into it and so I think\nwhat happens is not only are people\nemboldened by the attention in general\nbut because the internet is so big so\nvast you can always find your audience\nthere's always people that are going to\nbe supportive of whatever it is that\nyou're doing and so Hunters walking\naround thinking\nI'm you know I'm still the man I did a\ngood thing look how I'm a hero to all of\nthese people he doesn't recognize that\nthe segment of the population that\nsupports him is very very very small\nright but he's got a full Discord and a\nReddit feed and all these things that\nvalidate him\nexactly like the internet has made it so\nthat you could find your community in\nyour Niche and like before that you you\ncouldn't do that you know but you could\nfind people who are Anonymous but will\nlike agree with maybe the the depraved\nthings you're doing but they're\nAnonymous so they can go out there and\nlike you know do what you're doing like\na lot of people you know you know and\nhow it is yeah exactly so I definitely\nagree with that and that's not something\nI thought about before\num and guys I just wanted to let the\npsych2go viewers know please ask your\nquestions because we'll be answering\nthem at the end of the live so thank you\nand then so do you think it has a\npsychological impact on younger people\nespecially and do you think it can\ninfluence them to try to emulate the\nactions of negative role models who are\nseeing others become extremely famous on\nsocial media like do you think it has\nan even worse impact on our younger\ngeneration yeah I think I mean I think\nYouTube is a I'm on YouTube and I think\nit's a it's a problem in that well it's\ngood so like to answer the first part of\nthe question is it is valuable I like\nthe fact that you can be whatever you\nwant to be and I think because you can\nfind your audience the individual is\nempowered I think that's wonderful I\nalso feel like because YouTube YouTubers\nhave gotten so good at capturing the\nattention of Their audience so good at\nit's like finding ways to give dopamine\nhit after dopamine hit after dopamine\nhit that the audience sort of thinks\nit's this is the the best thing ever\nthey struggle to to to\num to wait and listen and learn they\nstruggle to find Nuance they just want\nto be entertained right now and I think\nthat that\npart of it is problem in particular for\num for younger audiences and then I\nworry about you know not only does it\nchange the way that they listen and\nlearn but I think it also might impact\nwho they want to be you know if I look\nat Mr Beast and that's what I want to be\nand I think about like I'm gonna do all\nthese big crazy things back to back to\nback to back\num I worried that it sets up unrealistic\nexpectations\nyeah exactly and so you think the\ninstant gratification of social media is\nalmost becoming like an addiction for a\nlot of like younger people yeah I mean I\nthink for a lot of reasons not and I was\nsaying like the way the content is being\ncreated like certainly if you like I\nhave a an eight-year-old and a\nfive-year-old they would far rather\nwatch YouTube videos than something on\nNetflix anything that Netflix is doing\nis too long they want a three minute\nvideo that's like you know I mean it\nfeel it feels addictive to them you take\nit away for they take the iPad from them\nand they're pissed like it really has an\nimpact\num\nyou know I think the other the opposite\nargument can be made that this is the\ndirection that the world is going and I\nimagine in 10 years in 20 years people\nthat can shift topics of focus really\nquickly will probably be\nrewarded for that because things will\nmove at that kind of a pace yeah you\nknow so there's it's probably\nthere's there's probably\nit's sort of unavoidable it's our\nreality and we have to find a way to\nlive within it but as a parent\nI get concerned about my kids on YouTube\nyeah I mean I see it with my own niece\nand my nephew like they just always have\nto be on there like that yeah so it's\ntrue\nhave you seen have you heard sorry to\ninterrupt you have you seen um if you\nturn your phone to grayscale have you\nheard about doing this and it changes\nlike it is stimulating it's stimulating\nto see all the colors like even the the\nphone itself is addictive if you turn if\nyou can if you can see if you turn it to\ngrayscale you can't uh it's way less\naddictive like just the colors itself\ndraw you I mean and exactly colors are\nused in marketing like you know\nMcDonald's in and out they use the color\nred specifically because they know I\ndon't know if it makes people hungry or\nwhat it does it captures their attention\nbut color is like extremely important\nand like the psychology of marketing so\nit is scary because social media does\nhave such a hold on our society now and\nmaybe it is an addiction and it's you\nknow it is scary in that way and so\nlooking at it from a more psychological\nstandpoint I came across this\ninteresting research study called the\nabsorption absorption addiction model\nwhich was proposed by researcher Lynn\nmccutchison or mccutching yeah which\ntheorizes that individuals who tend to\nobsess over celebrities and absorb\ninformation about their personal lives\nare attempting to compensate for their\ninsecurities or lack of personal\nIdentity or lack of meaningful\nrelationships do you feel like there's\nany truth to this model or This research\nso I don't know I've not read it but my\ngut reaction would be no I don't agree\nso the I would wonder like how would\nthey possibly\nunless they're going there and they're\nsaying what they'd have to say what is\nyour favorite TV show\nthen they'd have to psychologically\nprofile the characters in that show then\nthey have to ask the audience what are\nyour\nnot just what limitations do you think\nyou have but what like from a\npsychological standpoint what\nlimitations do we think you have it\nseems like a rough research project to\nbe able to actually prove that out and I\nthink that a lot of times people like\nmedia because it agrees with them I'm\nnot sure that you're always picking\npeople or you're I'm not sure you're\nalways following people\num\nthat point or so the the the the view is\nthat if you like a certain kind of media\nit's because\nsay that again it's because my\nlimitations are duplicated by that\nperson no I what I guess what the model\nis saying is that people who become over\nobsessed with celebrities like extremely\nobsessed and invested in their personal\nlives it's because somehow they're\nlacking in their own personal life and\nthey're lacking in their personal\nrelationships so it's almost like they\nlive vicariously yeah okay so it's not\nokay so it's they're not saying it's a\npersonality issue they're saying it's a\nrelationship issue yeah they're get\nthey're they're living that excitement\nthrough a celebrity exactly\nokay I'll say okay but I would think\nit's because here's why I'm pushing back\non it is because I think it's any kind\nof entertainment\nis escapism right if you look at you\ncould say the same thing probably people\nthat like Monday Night Football they\nmust not have a lot going on on Monday\nnight if they're watching Monday Night\nFootball so like at some level you're\nchoosing this\nthis entertainment even though it brings\nno Direct Value to your life even though\nit's not in your life you're choosing\nthis because it's more fun than your\nactual existence like I don't know that\nthat's exactly celebrity but you could\nsay if you like why do you like movies\nwhy do you like whatever it is that\nyou're any kind of sport you know what\nI'm saying so I'm I guess I'm yeah\nit feels extreme I understand where\nthey're coming from like if I'm obsessed\nwith somebody else I must not like\nmyself but I just don't know if there's\nreally data to support that I'd have to\nsee the study exactly but like you know\nthere's this new trend on well it's been\nkind of going on for a few years but\nwith social media that now you can be a\nsocial media impersonator like\num girls who will dress up as Ariana\nGrande and they'll just impersonate her\nand they become famous off of that like\nthey become that impersonator and that\ntheir whole identity becomes Ariana\nGrande or Rihanna or Beyonce they're\nimpersonating them so in a way just\nthere's some maybe validity to it but\nyeah I mean I'm not sure how much but in\nsome ways\nyeah\nokay I mean I guess it I have a negative\nreaction to it but I think it does make\nas you're the more you explain it the\nmore I would say like it makes sense\num I would just stop short of or I'd be\nnervous about sort of profiling people\nthat like I'm not sure that everybody\nthat likes Ariana Grande necessarily has\na deficit in their own social life\nthat's true yeah so maybe like people\nwho over obsess but even then it's hard\nto like diagnose someone right I agree\nwith that right yeah that's that's kind\nof maybe why I'm pushing back on it no I\ncompletely understand like it's always\nmore complex than what we see on the\nsurface yeah and so Tick Tock is\nprobably the biggest social media\nplatform at the moment and the\nprevalence of influencers is as\nubiquitous as ever so generally speaking\nwhat do you think is the negative impact\nof society's desire like generally\nspeaking society's desire to be famous\nand do you think it has anything to do\nwith narcissism\nI don't know that it has I think it can\nlead to narcissism so I think and I've\ndone this on I've talked about this like\nAd nauseam on my YouTube channel the\nterm triggered narcissist and Gaslight\nare so overused it drives me crazy it\njust drives me nuts so\nso there are real narcissists out there\nthat is a personality disorder it is a\npervasive pattern of behavior it's a it\nis a real deal significant diagnosis\nthat impacts multiple areas of\nsomebody's life\nI think what happens oftentimes is we\nthrow the term out and we go okay you\nknow so-and-so is selfish so then\nthey're a narcissist my ex was selfish\nso they're a narcissist right so I don't\nknow necessarily that everybody that is\num a narcissist is going to be obsessed\nwith social media I do think that\nnarcissism\num\nif you if you are constantly thinking\nabout your brand and your reputation\nit's it's an outlet for selfishness\nwhich I think can feed into narcissism\ndoes that make sense like I guess I\nwould it's such a selfish Endeavor\nanything that you do on social media so\neven in my case I'm not taking myself\nout of this I am sitting there talking\nto a camera just me and the camera and\nputting on there and then I'm watching\npeople react to me like it is a very\nselfish experience and but it's like the\nagain that's the Continuum of does it\nlead to narcissism or do narcissists\nlike it maybe but I would tell you that\nthe vast majority of people are not\nnarcissists\nthat's good to be self-interested does\nthat make sense yeah that's like the\nperfect way of putting it like just\nbecause someone isn't necessarily\nnarcissistic because they like social\nmedia and just because you don't use\nsocial media doesn't mean you're you're\nnot a narcissist right look at what\nyou're saying and people sometimes try\nto link the two and I think that's\ndangerous like just because someone\nlikes to post selfies or be on social\nmedia has nothing to do with\nnarcissistic personality disorder and I\ndo think it gets thrown out there too\noften yeah yeah exactly\num do you think that our generation's\nobsession with celebrities contributes\nto people's body image and\nself-esteemage issues such as like\neating disorders and body dysmorphia to\na certain extent\nin a significant way I think so I think\nit's I think that it has and I think\nthat there's research showing like like\nthe what people are attracted to has\nshifted over the years as different\ncelebrities have become popular and then\nit is really clear you can look at and\nyou can look in different cultures there\nare certainly you know Cemetery things\nlike that that everybody finds\nattractive but there are body types that\nare differently attractive in different\ncultures based on what's pumped out\nthrough the media and I really think in\nthe with Photoshop I think there's\nreally irresponsible influencers that\ndistort reality for people and it\nabsolutely if you are in if you are\ninsecure if you're not well grounded and\nyou are consuming hours and hours of\nof people on the beach whose bodies have\nbeen modified via Photoshop it's\ndamaging I I think of course yeah you\nknow absolutely it's damaging I I\ncompletely agree with that and do you\nthink that sometimes like people will\nfollow celebrities that maybe\nmaybe not like Maybe it stems from a\ntrauma or a mental health issue such as\nlike you know an eating disorder or body\ndysmorphia\nI think you can get\nI think it can feel\num\nwhat's the right word\nI'll just describe it I think it can\nfeel\num\nit can feel like things are red you can\nresonate with somebody that that says\nthe bad or that shows the bad things\nabout you that you feel\nif I feel really terrible and then I\nlisten to someone tell me how terrible I\nam there's a part of that feels there's\npart of that that feels like consistent\nand coherent and linear like yeah I'm a\nbad person and you tell me I'm a bad\nperson and that this is where I should\nbe does that you know what I mean can\nfeel like home a little bit\nmaybe it's the right word but that home\nisn't is a really terrible place\ndoes that make sense and so I do think\nthat there is some of that that goes on\nI mean people respond to trauma and such\nin so many different ways not everybody\ndoes that some people try to ignore what\nthey feel about themselves and do the\nopposite but\num I think there's definitely a role\nthat it plays\nyeah definitely and so so is this the\nline where you feel like celebrity\nworship crosses from harmless to\ndangerous\nyeah I think celebrity worship crosses\nthat line I guess in in two ways I think\nit crosses the line when you have\ncelebrities that are insincere\nand and when they're when a celebrity\nlies I think it's a real about what's\ngoing on in their life\nif if that's what they're selling and\nhow they look if that's what they're\nselling I think it's a real problem so\nthat I started doing YouTube because of\nI don't know if you ever did you ever\nfollow Dave and Rachel Hollis do you\nknow who they are I'm not they're a\ncouple of motivational speakers Rachel\nHollis wrote a book girl wash your face\nbecame super popular then her husband\nwho was a Disney executive uh sort of\njoined her team and they had a podcast\ntogether and they talked about how close\nthey were and we have a wonderful we\nhave an exceptional relationship\num you know and they're saying they have\nan exceptional relationship on one week\nand then the next week they get divorced\nand it was a very like sort of like\nclearly a departure from reality and\npeople are listening to them thinking I\nneed to have a marriage like that I\nthink that when that happens that\nworship\nis irresponsible and causes problems the\nsame thing if a Kardashian is out there\nsaying this is what my body looks like\nwhen they've had 15 people work on it\nthrough surgery makeup artists and then\na Photoshop artist I think that that\ncauses\nit causes problems exactly because\npeople think that's reality and that\nyeah and it distorts yeah if you're I\nthink it's anything like like even uh\nviolent video games there's a lot of\ndebate about if it's good or it's bad\nbut I think it makes a difference if the\nperson playing the game is grounded in\nreality if they have a reasonable\nself-esteem if they have a healthy\nenvironment then Grand Theft Auto\ndoesn't have a negative effect but if\nthe kid playing doesn't know who they\nare\nthen that causes it is going to have a\ndifferent effect you know exactly I\nthink sometimes people underestimate\nthat they think that like no well you're\nyour own person it's not going to affect\nyou but it can\npeople who are more susceptible yeah I\nthink it absolutely can affect you\nand then looking at it from from the\nother side I mean sometimes like I was\nmentioning a lot about how celebrity and\nfame affects Society but looking at it\nfrom the other side do you think that\nsociety's fascination with the\nself-destruction of celebrities such as\nsomeone like Kanye West do you think\nthat's like what do you think where do\nyou think that stems from and where's\nthe danger in that\nI think it's stem first so first of all\nI thought the way the media handled\nKanye West was disgusting I mean this is\na guy that in my opinion not even my\nopinion just anybody looking at this\nthat knows anything about mental health\nwould look at him and go he's bipolar\nlike he is inane he is in a manic\nepisode this is this is a time for us to\nsupport him this is a time for him to\nget help this is not a time for TMZ to\nshut to shove a camera in his face and\nask him about different marginalized\ncommunities like that is not and and TMZ\nor whoever the guy is with the camera\nknows exactly what they're doing and\nthey don't care and so I thought it was\njust a sort of a disgusting display to\nbe honest with you and I think that the\nreason why we do that the reason why TMZ\nputs the camera in his face is because\npeople are jealous people are\num it's hard to look at someone who is\nsuper successful we like it when they're\ngetting better and better we like when\nsomeone's growing but we like it more\nwhen they fall because it tells us that\nwe are better than that person there are\na lot of people who felt like Kanye West\nwas Superior to them that felt like they\ncould never be as successful as Kanye\nWest and they they\num they didn't like the fact that he's\nlike Will Smith people like the fact\nthat you have this guy that is sort of\nlike the model\num Superstar\nhe falls and you go look you're not any\nbetter than me and there is an\nempowerment when you can say you're not\nany better than me I think we\nunfortunately love that\nI agree with that like Society Sometimes\nsome people not everyone but there are\npeople who do like they feel happy when\nthey see that and it's funny and it's a\nspectacular even though it's it's so\nmuch more than that this is someone\ndealing with a mental health issue and\nwe should care but some people they find\nenjoyment out of it yeah or they get\nenjoyment out of it I completely agree\nwith that\num and do you think it's possible to\ndiagnose celebrities on TV or in the\nmedia from afar if not what is the\nimplication of it\nit's not possible so I it's funny\nbecause people because I'm always\nreacting to popular culture events and\npeople and people always want to know\nwhat's the diagnosis I always try to be\nreally careful about giving diagnoses\nand when I do what I usually say is\nbased on what I have seen like I can I\nwill talk about narcissism or bipolar or\nwhatever it is from the from I'm trying\nto educate about what the\ndiagnostic criteria are and maybe what\nwe're seeing but I try to stop short of\nsaying I know that this person has this\nright so I can look at Kanye West and I\ncan say he's bipolar only because Kanye\nWest has come out before instead I'm\nbipolar been diagnosed yeah as bipolar I\ncan look at his behavior and go I I mean\nI get why it's not a leap to get there\nbut\ndiagnoses have a very\nthey're very nuanced between clinicians\nthey're nuanced and I think it's I think\nthat there's value in somebody with my\nbackground communicating hey here's how\nI would think about X Y and Z I don't\nknow there's much value in me saying\nthis person's that way right so for\nexample on Sister Wives I started off\nand I said I do not think that based on\nwhat I have seen I don't think that Cody\nBrown is a narcissist\nand people were like outraged that I\nhadn't diagnosed him that way and then I\nwatched the last whole season I go I\nsaid okay so here's what has changed and\nbased on what I've seen I would label I\nwould give he does meet that diagnostic\ncriteria based on what I've seen but I\nam only seeing a highly curated picture\nof him via TLC or Discovery\nCommunications right so it I think we\nhave to be really careful about that\nyeah as people that are reacting and it\nwould be you know like you're not just\ngonna give in to what the audience says\nlike okay yeah he's a narcissist right\nlike you have an ethical responsibility\nyou're not just going to do that you\nknow yes because yes the audience wants\nyou to say he's a narcissist like you\nknow that's not you can't do that it is\nreally interesting to me how\nmotivated at least my audience is to get\ndefinitive labels people want to bucket\npeople we want to simplify celebrities I\nwant to know that this person is this\nway and that person is that way and tell\nme exactly what that diagnosis is\nright people struggle with Nuance we\nstruggle with hey in this situation\nshe's going to do well and right now\nshe's doing well but over here she's not\ndoing people struggle with that and as\nsomeone who's reacting to popular\nculture I struggle with how do I\ncommunicate the Nuance in a way that's\ndigestible\nyou know it's a it's an interesting\nit's interesting Dynamic yeah and I mean\nthis is kind of a digression but like\nCody Brown I think that he triggers\npeople so much because they you know a\nlot of people maybe have a Cody Brown in\ntheir life if they see that person in\nCody and they feel so like triggered I\nthink that Cody is just very triggering\nto a lot of people I think he is too and\nhe has it's funny so I started going\nback and watching from season one it he\nhas definitely evolved\nlike in a negative way I think yeah you\nknow what I mean I think that the\nspeaking of somebody about just the the\nexposure to the media I think it has\nchanged how he I think he was always\nself-interested\nno question but I think you know 12\nyears of being told you are you know\nthe top polygamist in the world or\nwhatever narrative he's got in his mind\nI think has created this sort of monster\nthat's uh I think in many ways\nemotionally abusive to his spouse to his\nwives\num\ntreats to kids horribly I mean he's\nsuper triggering from like an individual\nlevel as a as a husband and partner and\nas a father in each of those areas he's\ntriggering for people exactly like just\nseeing how he treats because he has a\nbig family too so so there's lots of\nlike everybody relates to somebody right\nyeah so\num do you think that our society's\nobsession with reality TV stars like\nSister Wives the Kardashians social\nmedia influencers will ever truly fade\naway or is it a part of our culture\nthat's here to stay I think it's here to\nstay really I really think that it's\nhere to stay because people like things\nthat are real what I think is not here\nto stay like I think that Sister Wives\nSister Wives uh 90 Day Fiance\num uh Love is Blind like that style\nwhere it's less\num\norchestrated less produced I think is\nhere to stay I think the Kardashians and\nVanderpump Rules I imagine that that\nwill fade off to me it's much more\nit's much more engaging for people to\nfeel like they're actually getting the\ntruth out of people and I think those\nother those highly produced shows\num feel less truthful so they're less\nthey're less sticky for an audience\nmember by the way that's my opinion and\nI think Vanderpump and Kardashians are\nway more popular in the other shows I\nmentioned so I'm not a media expert but\nthat's my at least as a viewer I imagine\nthat's the direction things would go\nyeah I can kind of see that even though\npeople kind of see the Kardashians as\nlike the first family of the US I know\nright which drives me it just drives me\ncrazy by the way I can't I have tried to\nreact to the Kardashians and Vanderpump\nRules is so popular right now and\nthey've got a big finale coming up it's\ncoming up on the 17th and I was like\nokay I need to watch the entire uh last\nseason yeah Michelle I have I think four\ntimes I've tried to watch Vanderpump\nRules I cannot it is so it's I cannot\nget it it is beyond vapid and then like\nI want to look at him and I'm gonna be\nlike hey like this Tom Sandoval do you\nknow I I he's he's so immature like I'm\nsitting there going like you're 40. he's\nlike 39 or 40 years he's my age and\nacting like that\nit's hard for me to get it yeah but you\ndo know their ratings were actually\nreally bad up until the Scandal like the\nshow is actually going downhill like the\nratings were really bad and this really\nheld it so they weren't actually that\npopular the last couple years but then\nthis Scandal it was like so huge that\ntheir ratings are up now so yeah yeah I\ndo not unders I do not understand it I\njust right I cannot yeah exactly so now\nwe're going to move to the audience\nquestion segment so the first one I have\nhere is from Jennifer so Dr David do you\nbelieve that our media exploits uh the\nmental illness of celebrities\n100 percent\nI think I think in a I think in a big\nway I think our media exploits anything\nthat it can and so I think it's really I\nthink it's really difficult\nit's just it's just human nature to want\nto know what's going on with people and\nI think that that I think mental illness\nfits into that vulnerability bucket and\nit fits into that provocative bucket and\nthe media doesn't care like Kanye West\nis a good example the media doesn't or\nBritney Spears the media doesn't care\nwhat's the what's the psychological\neffect on Kanye or on Brittany\ncould care less they just they just want\nratings and I think so it leads to a lot\nof exploitation\nyeah exactly I completely agree\nsometimes we don't see it from like\nsometimes our society doesn't have as\nmuch empathy for the celebrity side of\nit\nyeah and I think it's I mean I know that\nsociety's view is well you chose to be a\ncelebrity so this is your sort of\npenance for that but I just think that's\na really immature review people chose to\nbe celebrities in whatever their\nspecific area is they didn't choose to\nbe sliced and diced by the media\nyou know exactly exactly and so Travis\nis asking do you think that celebrities\nlike the Kardashians have actually had a\npositive impact on our society in any\nway\nthe Kardashians I mean I think no I'm\nnot I'm not I'm not a major viewer of\nthe Kardashians\num\nI would I would struggle to see what the\npositive\nyou know I think I think that there was\na period where they were good I actually\nbut this is like they've been on for\nwhat is it 15 years or 20 years some\ncrazy number 15 years and they were kind\nof known before that too because yeah\nRobert Kardashian yeah when they first\ncame out I think I remember thinking\nthat they were good for body image\nbecause they weren't saying you have to\nbe real thin I think that the the ship\nhas sailed on that in a really negative\nway where they all look\nfake to me and I I fake I think fake\nespecially when you're not communicating\nthat it's fake is really damaging oh\nabsolutely I completely agree with that\nand then Joel has a question a really\ngood question\nDr David what is the most important\nthing about social media that you would\nchange\nthat's a good question what would I\nchange about it I would change how the\nalgorithm\nI mean in a perfect world I would change\nhow the algorithm works so that\nprovocative doesn't\num isn't weighted more than a more\nsubstantive work so for example I have\nso I have\num a pop psych YouTube channel which is\njust me reacting to popular culture\nwhich is my favorite Channel I put the\nmost effort into it\num but I'm reacting to popular culture I\nhave another Channel that's just called\nDavid kohlerosi PhD and it's a little\nbit more of a serious Channel I'm\ntalking about like I did a video on uh\nthe word the overuse of the word\ntriggered or on Impact versus intent and\nthose like my pop psych videos a sister\nwife video will get\n50 000 views and a video on triggered\nwill get 200 views and it's just because\nwhat I'm talking about requires more\nattention it's not as provocative and so\nit gets no and so I think it's really\nhard as a Creator to put out content\nthat is\nsubstantive when you really just know\nthat I just need to be flamboyant about\nsomething you know back to the Jake Paul\nthing I can be you know I can I can\nbring a gigantic robot to a boxing match\nand I'm gonna get a lot more views\nbecause of that I think that I don't\nknow how you get right that's how the\nalgorithm works of course what people\nclick on and what they watch people\nthey're going to feed you more of that\nbut I wish it wasn't that way exactly\nyeah yeah so I work really hard so if\nyou look at my Sister Wives videos what\nI try to do is I will talk about\nwhatever the episode is and then I\nalways try to bring in some more serious\ndiscussion about from a psychological\nmind standpoint that I think is valuable\nto the audience versus just being\ngossipy you know like I try to it's a\nlittle bit like\num you know hiding your vegetables in\nthe dessert like that's kind of how I\nthink about it because the algorithm\npumps out that stuff so much more is\nthat and what I like about your videos\ntoo um I was watching one the other day\nyou like observe something and you like\nwe'll talk about it and it's like I\ndidn't even notice that like Cody's\ndancing at the wedding you noticed how\nlike it was very flamboyant kind of and\nI didn't even noticed that it was kind\nof narcissistic I just thought oh my\ngosh\nexactly right so like little things like\nthat yeah it's amazing when I look at my\ncomments how many I mean a lot of people\nsee different things that I don't see\neither you know what I mean it's like\nyou said that show or any show strikes\neverybody differently and it is amazing\nto see how many people\nnotice things like that yeah\nand then uh Evie has a question what's\nyour take on horror movies and video\ngames played by children since their\nmaturity ratings are way up there should\nthat be up to the parents or no should\njust children be able to play video\ngames as they'd like\nI would be in the camp of make it\num make give the parents the ability to\njudge with their kids consume you know I\nI would I it feels\num\nDraconian I think to often say you know\nthe government gets to decide at what\nage your kid can do what that said as a\nparent I wouldn't want my kid watching\nyou know or playing mature video games\nat a young age so I think that the I\nthink the concern is reasonable I just\nwouldn't want to disempower the parents\nexactly like they should have some\nlike say in it but some people feel like\nstrongly about that that you shouldn't\nlike I don't know well the issue the\nissue is that that there is you know\nlike anything in parenting there's no\njudge there's no ability for us to\nevaluate who's a good or a bad parent\nand the and you know it's like you can't\ndisempower the parents that you think\naren't doing a good job and empower the\nones who think right you can't control\nthat so I think like you have to empower\nall parents\num but some are more thoughtful about\nwhat their kids consume than others you\nknow\nyeah\ncompletely agree and then Philip as it's\ngoing to be our last question\num what is the panel's opinion on how\nalgorithms are negatively or positively\nshaping Western culture is this more of\na western you know cultures issue in\nyour opinion with social media and\ncelebrity worship\noh I I have I do not have a good answer\nfor that I don't know I think it I think\nthat I I would argue that the algorithm\ndefinitely influences how we think\num in a in a in a big way in our culture\nI don't know enough about other cultures\nto weigh in on it but I guess I will add\nthat which I think is an interesting\nfrom a psychological standpoint\nyou know we we are I feel like humans\nare I'll use the word uh you know like\ncultish or or we we want to be not\ncultures maybe the wrong word but we\nwant to be in groups we want to feel\nlike we are connected to people and so\nwhat that means is that when you\ninteract with somebody you always you're\ngoing to find a way to verbalize\nwhatever your views are to sort of tell\nthem hey here's the group you know I\nbelong in this group or I belong in your\ngroup and what happens is I think on\nsocial media is that people want to\ndemonstrate their belonging with a\nparticular group and so they get more\nand more extreme and so when people\nwouldn't would normally be pretty\nsimilar in their views if you track the\nalgorithm or what's shared with you on\nsocial media you're getting\nprogressively more and more extreme\nviews I think just because people want\nto say hey I'm on this team and you know\nyou have to get more and more extreme to\nget the attention of the algorithm to\ntell the algorithm what group you belong\nin and so if you look at just your if\nyou look at my feed there's like really\nextreme views from everybody no one ever\nsays hey it's a little bit of that and a\nlittle bit of this it's never a\nsomewhere in the middle it's always this\nguy is the worst and this guy's the best\nyou know it's it's a so I think it\ndistorts how we how we think\nthis is my question but do you think\nsocial media and YouTube maybe attracts\nmore passionate about people about these\nissues because I know people who would\nnever hop on a YouTube comment section\nyeah they would never be caught dead\ndude like my sister yes yes yeah I think\nso I think it I mean YouTube does I\nthink Reddit does which is really\nI I like people or I admire people I\ndon't care what it is that are all in on\nthings that participate fully in life\nlike I'm attracted to that kind of a\nperson and so for me if people like when\ngoing on to reddit reddit is not the The\nForum that I would ever use to talk\nabout an issue but if I go on to Reddit\nI can read people that are so\nimpassioned about every it's like\nanything and they have so much to say\nand I think it's a wonderful outlet for\npeople and if we didn't have YouTube or\nReddit or these platforms I think people\njust sit with their thoughts and don't\nshare them and so I I like that part of\nit\nyeah I agree with that's like a release\nit is um you know helpful to some degree\ndefinitely yeah I agree with that yeah\nand so now just turning to our last\nsegment the importance of mental health\nawareness since May is mental health\nawareness month\num just some quick questions how can we\neliminate the stigma around Mental\nHealth\nI think there's a lot of things that we\ncould do differently about it I think of\ncourse talking about it\nI I think that's in that's and talking\nabout it and not in a judgmental way I\nthink is really important I also think\nfrom a celebrity standpoint\nI wish that\nwhen P there have been so many examples\nI'm thinking of Dave Hollis I'm thinking\nof Tony Shea and there's there's I feel\nlike there's whenever a celebrity dies\nas a result of suicide or\num or or overdose the the media's\ninitial reaction is to not tell you what\nhappened and then they wait like six\nmonths to say oh here's what happened\nand by that point the attention is off\nof it and I really wish that I know it's\nnot the family's responsibility I I I I\ndon't know how you fix it but I wish\nthat when something happened that was\ncatastrophic I wish that the media was\ntransparent about this is what happened\nand this could happen this is a this is\na prevalent significant issue and you\nshould take it seriously and I feel like\nwe allow\ncelebrity allows us to distort mental\nillness as it's something that is\num not that significant or doesn't\nhappen much or we sort of push it to the\nside so when people feel it they don't\nthink it's as prevalent as it is\nyou know what I mean and we we sort of\nminimize the severity which I think is a\nproblem like I wish we would talk about\nit more and when there were celebrities\nthat had mental illness I wish they\nwould talk about it in a more\ntransparent\nway and I'm I'm just gonna get a soapbox\nI gotta say one more thing about that I\nalso really struggle with celebrities\nthat I feel like\nand I'm not going to name them but\nthere's there's several there's several\nright now that I think are very vocal\nabout their mental illness and I feel\nlike they do it in a very\nself-aggrandizing attention-seeking\nmanner that's also insincere which\ndrives me freaking crazy\nI I just want it real and I think we\ndon't you can see through that people\ncan see I hope I hope so\nI think your I think the thing I think\nthings like that should be just treated\nmore carefully than they are\nexactly because it is like more complex\nand I mean celebrities you have a\nresponsibility to a certain degree so\nand then I guess last question\num to wrap it up what is the best\nself-care advice for someone struggling\nwith mental health issues that you would\ngive\ngo to a therapist and what I would I\nwould add to it is be a good\num be a Discerning user of therapy I\nthink the thing that I because I used to\nwork as a therapist and I will tell you\nand as my and right now as an executive\ncoach it's the same thing\nour job the mental health professional's\njob like I would argue 99 of our job is\nto make the participant whoever the\nthat's going through the treatment feel\nunderstood feel connected feel like they\nhave a strong relation we our job is to\nmake this person feel comfortable with\nus and if you ever go to therapy and\nyou're in session two or three and\nyou're like this person doesn't get me I\ndon't like this person I don't want to\nbe here get a different therapist we\nshould use we should we should rotate\ntherapists like we rotate restaurants if\nyou don't like the food go somewhere\nelse when you find the therapist or an\nexecutive coach or a life coach or\nwhoever that you that really resonates\nwith you you're gonna want to go back\nand talk with that person\nand I think that to me is is\nI think people are people just go I'm\ngoing to go to therapy and suffer with\nthis person that I don't really click\nwith\nexactly and like you're there to get the\nhelp you need and so if it's not like\nworking out you should immediately\nchange it like you would change your\nhair stylist like that's I really for\nyou it's for you yes it's really all\nright and so you're going there and now\nyou're trying to make some guy feel\ncomfortable you're just it's it's not\nright it's it's just a misuse of it and\nso I wish that we were that when people\nstruggled they would go I need support\nand I'm gonna meet with three people\nuntil I find the person that I really\nwant to talk with yeah exactly and\npeople shouldn't view mental health as\nlike an inconvenience I have to see a\ntherapist they should see it as\nsomething that's self-care and something\nthat they absolutely deserve and have a\nright to yes absolutely yeah exactly\nwell thank you yeah exactly and thank\nyou so much for meeting with me Dr\ncaller Rossi was an amazing conversation\nthank you for having me it was great I\nreally appreciate it of course and thank\nyou to the psychicco viewers for tuning\nin and you guys can um see the links in\nthe description you can check out Dr\nCarl Rossi's Channel you
