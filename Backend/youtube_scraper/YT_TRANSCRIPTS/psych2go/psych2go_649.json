    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Modern society\nhas brought many advancements,\nfrom personal computers and factory lines,\nto artificial intelligence\nand smartphones.\nOne unexpected side effect\nof modernization is burnout,\nwhich was coined in the 1970s.\nIt was originally described\nby psychologist Herbert Freudenberger,\nas becoming exhausted by\nmaking excessive demands\non energy, strength, or resources.\nBut in recent years, the\ndefinition has expanded.\nBurnout is physical,\nemotional or mental exhaustion\nthat causes decreased motivation,\nlow performance and negative attitudes.\nIt can result from\nprolonged stress or enduring\noverwhelming physical or mental exertion\nthat is beyond one's workload.\nThe concept of burnout has\nrecently made a comeback,\nthanks to the pandemic.\nWith the transition to remote work,\nmany people are experiencing\nburnout at home.\nRemote work makes life easier,\nbut without healthy boundaries in place,\nyour personal life could suffer.\nYou may experience typical\nemotional or mental cues\nof burnout, such as reduced\nfocus or lack of motivation,\nbut there are physical\nsigns of burnout as well.\nWe'll explore seven signs of\nburnout and possible solutions.\nNumber one, overall fatigue.\nThe most obvious sign\nof burnout is fatigue.\nFeeling drained and exhausted from working\nis understandable, but\nfatigue is a bit different.\nAlthough it's usually a physical state,\nit can also affect your mental\nand emotional wellbeing,\nlike making you emotionally sensitive.\nThe fatigue you feel when you're burnt out\nisn't just linked to the\namount of work you have to do,\nbut also to the amount\nof stress you're under.\nStress consumes a lot of energy,\nand chronic stress is like\ncontracting a muscle for a long time.\nIt gets fatigued and isn't very useful,\nand the same happens to us.\nChronic stress affects your\nsleep and eating habits\nbut also over produces cortisol,\nwhich takes up a lot of energy\nand doesn't replenish it.\nIn a dangerous situation,\nthis is a normal response.\nYour body is priming you\nto fight or run away.\nHowever, we don't confront\ntigers on our way to work\nor have to run miles from our enemies.\nWe sit at our desks without\nusing up the glucose\nour stressed out bodies have produced.\nPhD researcher, Robert\nJester, explains that burnout\ncauses extreme exhaustion\nthat isn't solved\nby getting sleep.\nA great way to prevent\nfatigue and an increase\nin cortisol levels is by taking\n10 minutes out of your day\nto relax.\nJust close your eyes and\nfocus on your breathing.\nTry to detach yourself from all the things\nyou think you have to do,\nor know you have to do.\nTwo, sweet cravings.\nCraving sweets is common when\nyou're chronically stressed\nand burnt out.\nIt's your body's way of\nreplenishing the glucose it spends.\nHowever, constantly adding\nglucose into your body\nand not actually using it\ncan cause future problems\ndown the road.\nA common result is type two diabetes,\nwhich occurs when your body develops\na resistance to insulin,\naccording to the National\nInstitute of Diabetes\nand Digestive and Kidney Diseases.\nAlso, it doesn't help\nthat when you're stressed,\nyou naturally crave sugar\nbecause your body uses that\nas fuel to confront the dangers\nthat have got you stressed.\nNumber three, tension headaches.\nAnother common sign of\nburnout is tension headaches\nsays psychologist Dr Adam Borland.\nTension headaches are also a\nside effect of too much stress,\nbut can also be caused by\na change in eating habits.\nWhen you're stressed,\nyou might forget to eat\nor drink water throughout\nthe day, or worse,\nyou might also eat unhealthy junk food\nbecause they're either\nfaster to cook or less fussy.\nNo judgment, but those types\nof foods can be culprits\nfor your headaches.\nIf cooking isn't your thing,\ntry to prepare food ahead of time.\nTake 30 minutes over the\nweekend to plan your meals\nfor the next couple of days.\nMake sure you include plenty of vegetables\nin your prepped meals.\nIf you don't like the idea\nof preparing food ahead,\ncook simple meals.\nSimpler meals usually\ninvolve few ingredients.\nThere are a lot of ideas online,\nso go ahead and do some\nresearch for inspiration.\nFour, high blood pressure.\nHigh blood pressure is both a consequence\nbut also a sign of burnout.\nIt can be a consequence\nof burnout if it is caused\nby the foods you're\nconsuming, but as a sign,\nhigh blood pressure is\ncaused by chronic stress.\nStress can cause temporary\nspikes in blood pressure\nthat can damage your blood\nvessels, heart and kidneys\naccording to the Mayo Clinic.\nAnd your hormones can damage your arteries\nwhich can lead to heart disease.\nBut don't fret, you can do\nthings to help manage your stress\nand improve your health.\nExercise is a great way to\nkeep your blood pressure\nmore stable, and it also\ncan help you de-stress.\nIf you're burned out and fatigued,\nopt for a lighter exercise.\nDo some yoga or tai chi.\nYou're still moving,\nbut not moving in a way\nthat stresses out your body more.\nNumber five, heart problems.\nIf your high blood pressure\nis left unattended,\nit can cause heart problems.\nHaving high blood pressure\ncan put you at risk for stroke\nand other cardiovascular\ndiseases, so please find a way to\ndecrease your stress-induced\nhigh blood pressure.\nAccording to Dr Marie-Noelle Langan,\nwho specializes in cardiology,\nit's common to have heart\nissues like palpitations\nor a racing pulse once in a while,\nbut if they happen a lot or for longer\nthan just a few seconds,\nyou should get checked out.\nWhen we're dehydrated,\nour body may also increase\nour heart rate to keep\nour blood volume the same,\nwhich could lead to more serious issues.\nIf high blood becomes a concern,\nreach out to a medical\nhealth provider for help.\nSix, stomach problems.\nOne surprising sign of\nburnout is stomach problems.\nBurnout heavily taxes your gut\nand can produce intestinal inflammation.\nIf left untreated, it can lead to stomach,\noverly taxes your gut\nand clear complications.\nIn recent years, there has\nbeen a plethora of research\nsupporting the link between\nyour mind and your gut.\nWhen stressed, your body halts digestion\nin order to produce more energy.\nIf you're constantly stressed,\nyou're not digesting your food properly\nand putting your gut health at risk.\nBut there is a silver lining.\nA 2013 clinical review published\nby the University of\nChapel Hill found that\npsychological treatments\nlike CBT were effective\nin treating gastrointestinal\ndisorders caused by stress.\nSo, if your burnout is too much to handle,\nreach out to a licensed\nprofessional for help.\nAnd number seven, insomnia.\nThe final sign of burnout is insomnia,\nwhich is a common symptom\nwhen you're stressed.\nInsomnia is what happens\nwhen you take your worries\nto bed with you.\nThey loom over you and prevent you\nfrom getting a good night's sleep.\nTo combat insomnia,\nit's best to try to put your mind at ease.\nA great practice is to exercise.\nIn 2013, Chicago's Northwestern\nUniversity discovered\nthat older women with\ninsomnia were able to improve\nthe issue by doing a\nhalf hour of exercise,\nthree times a week for four months.\nThey ended up getting an\nextra 45 minutes or more\nof much needed sleep.\nBurnout is serious, it's not\nsomething you should overlook.\nIf you need a break, ask.\nTalk to your boss about\ntaking a few days off.\nFind ways to make your\nlife just a bit easier.\nFor example, if you feel like\nyour to-do list is too much,\nplan your time for each task\nand also plan your breaks.\nIf you feel overwhelmed\nby the amount of tasks\non your to-do list, prioritize them,\nbut don't exceed more than five.\nOnce you've made your list,\ncalmly work through them\nand get them done.\nIf you don't finish, that's fine.\nJust add it to the next day's to-do list,\nbut try not to exceed the five\nitems to keep it manageable.\nCan you relate to feeling burnt out?\nShare with us
