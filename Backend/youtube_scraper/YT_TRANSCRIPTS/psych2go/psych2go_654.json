    "transcript": "love is a mysterious thing you never\nknow when it will strike and it can be\nclose to impossible to figure out if\nyour crush actually likes you back is\nthat a twinkle in their eye or were they\ntearing up at a tick tock was that hug\nmore than just friendly did they sit\nnext to you on purpose\nis the reason their smile gets so wide\nwhen they see you love so many questions\nso little answers and literally zero\ncues to help you figure it out well\nstrike that last part with scientific\nstudies on romance we've learned about\nsome Clues to tell if your crush likes\nyou back you'll be the romance's version\nof Sherlock Holmes or Inspector Clouseau\nif there's a crush afoot you'll find\nthem today we'll search for Clues by\npresenting you a story of Mia and Jenny\nwhat were the signs that they liked each\nother and how can you know if your crush\nlikes you too let's find out\nthe initial tiptoeing first meet Mia\nshe's your regular everyday college\nstudent with too many interests and too\nlittle time she enjoys sewing binge\nwatching the office and baking banana\nbread almost every weekend but most of\nall she loves to study in her\nUniversity's Library not because she's\nsuch a conscientious student but because\nit's where she can be close to Jenny\nJenny beautiful amazing Jenny Mia is\nsure she doesn't have a chance but she\nstill can't stop the butterflies in her\nstomach whenever they study together\nit's like she can literally feel her\nheart pounding in her chest her ears and\ncheeks get all warm sometimes she\ncatches herself smiling and staring at\nJenny while she's taking notes and\nthat's when she wonders gosh Mia are you\nout of your mind Mia may be a bit\nembarrassed by her behavior but\npsychology says this is totally normal\nthe 2020 study published in journal\nadaptive human behavior and Physiology\nfound that when we're highly attracted\nto someone we tend to show nervous and\nanxious reactions participants from the\nstudy said that when they're around\nsomeone they like they experience\nincreased attentiveness smiling staring\nincreased heart rate giggling blushing\nand difficulty concentrating the study\nalso found that participants reported\nobserving nervous reactions by others\nwhom they perceived were attracted to\nthem\nis it possible that Jenny noticed all of\nthis\ntell me about it\nJenny was a bit on the shy side so when\nshe noticed Mia glancing at her across\nthe table she was too afraid to look up\noh but she wanted to ever since Mia sat\nnext to her in the library she couldn't\nstop thinking about me a study session\nafter study session she wanted to talk\nto Mia but didn't know how would you\neven say a joke what if it's not funny\nand what if her overthinking got\ninterrupted by a note Mia passed her\nwant to take a break and grab a cup of\ncoffee\nand that's when they had their first\ncoffee and conversation Jenny was still\nvery anxious and afraid of accidentally\nreferencing a stale meme from 2010 but\nas they talked more and more she\nrealized with Mia she can totally open\nup in no time they went from hating on\nthe barely lit Game of Thrones ending to\ndiscussing Jenny's struggles with social\nanxiety\nwas that the beginning of a friendship\nor something more if you ask\npsychologists Irwin Altman and Thomas\nTaylor they would agree that this is the\nbeginning of a little romance\nin 1973 they developed a theory which\nstates that relationships begin and grow\nthrough talking about yourself\nthis may start a small talk but as time\ngoes by this can turn into sharing more\nintimate stories or that one fear you've\nnever shared with anyone this is how\nrelationships gain meaning and this is\nexactly what happened with Jenny and Mia\nlet's see what happens next with our\nenamored girls\nlet's do it together\nMia couldn't believe what was happening\nshe and Jenny dating\never since she mustered up the courage\nto finally talk to Jenny they've been\ngoing on all sorts of dates from talking\nand drinking vanilla iced coffees to\ntaking yoga classes together riding\ntheir bikes and baking banana bread and\nMia's tiny condo even though things were\ngoing really well Mia was still too\nafraid to show her real feelings it was\njust too risky to try and confess her\nlove what if it scares Jenny away while\nthese scared thoughts ping-ponged around\nher head Mia didn't even notice how\nstrong their bond had gotten and that\nJenny was falling in love too\nresearchers Leslie Baxter and Connie\nBullis studied relationships turning\npoints just like the one we're seeing\nwith Mia and Jenny as they concluded in\n1986 when they published their first\nfindings in relational turning points\ndoing shared activities together is one\nof the common themes that turn a close\nfriend into a partner Mia was so nervous\nthat she didn't notice Jenny's voice\nshaking when she stood a bit too close\nor how she always found a way to\naccidentally touch her hand what do you\nthink do you think this is love blooming\nor just some friends with anxiety drop a\ncomment below letting the world know\nJenny was absolutely sure that she was\nin love now if she had the chance she\nwould scream at the top of her lungs to\nlet the whole world know spending time\nwith other people suddenly seemed so\nboring to help make those times more\nbearable she decided to invite Mia as\nwell event by event Jenny's mom sister\nand even her best friend from elementary\nschool all got the privilege of meeting\nher soul mate Mia\nremember how embarrassed both of the\ngirls were to show signs of affection\nwhen they first met well their family\nand friends thought it was pretty\nobvious they were head over heels for\neach other but neither minded in fact\nthat actually made them happy that their\nloved ones noticed\nwhen you introduce a friend or\nsignificant others to other groups of\npeople in your life this is what\npsychologists call social networking\nthey believe that as people become\ncloser and more committed to each other\nthere is more overlap between their\nsocial networks one study in 2005\npublished in Western Journal of\ncommunication found that women who\ndesire a relationship with their friends\nare likely to introduce them to their\nSocial Circle example Mean Girls Regina\nGeorge wanted to get to know Katie\nbetter to figure out how to manipulate\nher so she introduced her to her friend\ngroup The Plastics\nthat way Katie could be invited to more\noutings and Regina would have more\nopportunities to get to know her\nmalicious intent but same Principle as\nwhat Jenny did with Mia Jenny wanted her\nto officially become a part of her life\nso she intertwined Mia into other\naspects of her life everyone seemed to\nlove her and that gave her a boost of\nconfidence that she was searching for\nlet's take a little pause for Mia and\nJenny's story for a second and analyze\ntheir situation\naccording to science Mia and Jenny\nexhibited all of the signs of romantic\nattraction even if they believed it was\njust friendship\nhopefully they're able to show their\ntrue feelings soon\nis something similar going on between\nyou and your crush we know it's hard to\nsee the line between love and friendship\nso if you need even more clues take a\nlook at eight signs you're more than\njust friends\nas for Mia and Jenny one day when no one\nwas looking they shared their first kiss\nin that cozy Library where it all\nstarted their fingers are crossed that\nyou and your crush will share one as\nwell"
