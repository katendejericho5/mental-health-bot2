things.\nYou feel a total lack of\ncontrol over your life,\nyour turbulent emotions rule over you.\nIf you answered B the most,\nyour eyes are filled with anger and rage.\nDid someone do something

that you're\nnot your true self around them\nconstantly wearing a mask.\nYou want to be genuine\nwith someone, anyone,\nbut you feel that there's no\none that you can confide in.\nPeople may be led to believe\nthat you're an independent\nperson who enjoys your solitude,\nbut you're just trying to blend\nin for people to like you.\nIn the past, people may have failed you\non multiple occasions, learn\nto open yourself up to others.\nNot that perfect self\nyou show with your mask,\nbut your true, genuine flawed self.\nYou'll have more genuine\nrelationships in the love long run\nwith people who actually care about you.\nIt won't be easy, but it'll\nbe worth it in the end.\nAnd if you answered\nmostly Es, your eyes glow.\nYou're one happy person.\nYou know you're not perfect,\nbut you're
