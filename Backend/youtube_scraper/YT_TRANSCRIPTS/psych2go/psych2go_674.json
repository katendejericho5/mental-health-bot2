bodily\ninjury the Physicians would describe it\nas a trauma case\nhowever trauma can also manifest as an\nemotional wound damaging your sense of\nself in an equally painful way\nunresolved emotional trauma causes you\nto perceive yourself as broken and\nunlovable and you unknowingly carry this\nbelief into your relationships so with\nthat said let's take a look at how your\nunhealed trauma affects your\nrelationships\nwhen you are in a relationship have you\never noticed that three different parts\nof you may be in charge\na licensed mental health counselor Greg\nDouglas says that you may be a wounded\nchild an Adaptive child or a functional\nadult at any given time in your life\nlet's talk about the wounded child\nwhen you were young\nwere you ever abused physically\npsychologically or sexually\nwere you deprived of Love support\nnurturing or consistent attention from\nyour caregivers let's say your partner\nmakes a condescending remark to you\nalmost resembling what your mother\nalways did\nyou are immediately flooded with\nfeelings of sadness deep pain and shame\nand your responses just to accept what\nhas been done to you without even trying\nto stand up for yourself\nin this case when you receive treatment\nfrom someone who reminds you of any\nprevious wounding experiences\nyou will likely behave in the same way\nyou did then next is the Adaptive child\nhave you ever been involved in a serious\ndispute with your caregiver when you\nwere young you might have been arguing\nwith your father and he shouts at you\nwhen you respond by becoming defensive\nand shouting back\nthrough these experiences you eventually\nlearned that being loud and angry is the\nonly way to gain respect and be heard\nthus when you encounter a similar\nsituation in your relationship you will\nalso respond in the same way harsh and\nrough\nyou can think of an Adaptive child as a\nyounger version of yourself who has to\nfigure out how to cope with not meeting\nyour needs to adapt to the treatment you\nhave received you use what ideas and\nresources you have at hand and then\nthere's the functional adult\nas a functional adult you respond in a\nmanner that resolves the disconnection\nwithin the relationship this is the\nmature and thoughtful part of you that\nhas left behind the patterns of the\nAdaptive and wounded child and done
