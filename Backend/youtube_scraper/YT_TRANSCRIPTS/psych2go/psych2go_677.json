    "transcript": "hey psych2goers welcome back to another\nvideo\nempaths are kind caring nurturing and\nloyal friends\nthey're seen as dependable and\ntrustworthy because they make others\nfeel safe\nbut being exposed to other people's\nemotions at all times is exhausting this\ngift of hyper empathy has negative side\neffects not only can you become\nemotionally exhausted but also you can\nbecome so absorbed in other people's\nemotions that you forget to take care of\nyour own these are five negative sides\nof being an empath before we begin we\nwanted to make a disclaimer that this\nvideo is not to attack anyone who may\ndisplay these signs but to help us\nunderstand and bring awareness to these\ndarker aspects number one their actions\nmay seem forced in efforts to keep the\npeace and avoid conflicts some empaths\nbecome performative they may say or do\nthings they do not believe they will act\nkind warm and diplomatic however they\nmay be going through the motions as an\nempath you will have days where you do\nnot feel emotionally capable of being\nyour ideal warm super supportive and\nunderstanding self and that's okay after\nall you are human too it's important to\nremind yourself that your emotional\nneeds matter\nso set time aside to look after yourself\nif someone needs your support you can\nstill be there for them but set\nboundaries for how present and invested\nyou are willing to be there for them at\nthat moment\nnumber two they may take advantage of\ntheir ability there are always two sides\nto everything when an empath's\npersonality merges with a personality\nfrom the dark Triad they become a dark\nempath it might initially sound like\nsomething out of a sci-fi movie or a\ndark fantasy novel but dark empaths are\nreal a dark empath uses their ability to\nread people so they can manipulate and\ntake advantage of them dark empaths use\nempathy to draw people close and mine\ninformation out of them a dark empath\nmay look kind and warm on the outside\nbut in reality our unfeeling and\ncalculative with acute focus and\nprecision they learn what makes a person\ntick and can influence others to act the\nway they want number three they\nexperience frequent bounds of paranoia\nall humans possess mirror neurons but\nresearch suggests that the MNS of an\nempath is more responsive this\nhypersensitivity can lead some empaths\nto experience more anxiety and paranoia\naccording to Dr orloff anxiety and\nparanoia are results rather than\nsymptoms of being an empath if you are\nan empath who experiences frequent\nanxiety try to understand your emotions\njournaling or working with a therapist\ncan help you adjust to your own emotions\nand the emotions you may have absorbed\nfrom those around you\nnumber four they experience cognitive\ndissonance cognitive dissonance is a\nstate of having inconsistent thoughts\nbeliefs or attitudes it is the mental\ndiscomfort you may experience when you\nHarbor two conflicting ideas for example\nyou may do something that does not align\nwith your core beliefs\nfor an empath it might look like\nindecision but is a form of\nself-preservation there are several ways\nof dealing with conflicting beliefs one\nway is to provide enough evidence for\nthe supportive belief doing so will help\nyou outweigh the dissonance that you\nfeel for example if you're passionate\nabout climate change but feel that your\noutdated car goes against your beliefs\nwork towards swapping out your car for a\nmore environmentally friendly option or\nride your bike to get around town do\nthings to support what you believe in\nand number five they can be frequent\nLiars sometimes to avoid hurting other\npeople's feelings and past lie they see\nlying as a way to maintain Harmony and\navoid conflicts at times they may bottle\nup their feelings and thoughts to comply\nwith popular opinion however this tactic\ncan have immediate negative effects not\nonly does society teach us that lying is\nbad because it harms our relationships\nbut lying can also prevent us from\nrelating to others research led by Julia\nLee from the University of Michigan\nfound that lying lowers your empathetic\naccuracy what does this mean to an\nempath whether the lies they tell are\ndetected or not an empath at that moment\nis unable to identify the other person's\nemotion and is likely to continue lying\nif you are an empath who resorts to lies\nto maintain Harmony it's time to be\nhonest not just for the sake of your\nrelationships but also for yourself\nthe Dark Side of an empath is not born\nout of malice sometimes it is a means of\nself-preservation however it does not\nmean that any of these traits are\ndefensible if you are an empath and\nrecognize some of these traits within\nyourself seek help to rectify them talk\nto a counselor if you need assistance\nplease like and share this video If it\nhelped you and you think it could help\nsomeone else too the
