come from\nmany difficult sources and sometimes\nthis includes those closest to you your\nfamily\nnegative experiences you had growing up\nor even heavy responsibilities and\nexpectations placed on you throughout\nyour childhood can often be too\ndifficult to forget\npsychologists call these adverse\nchildhood experiences potentially\ntraumatic events that can happen from a\nchild's birth until they reach adulthood\naccording to Centers for Disease and\nprevention these events are linked to\nChronic health problems mental illnesses\nand substance use problems in\nadolescence and adulthood so even as you\ngrow up and replace the family you were\nborn into with the family you choose for\nyourself it's still hard to let go of\nthe trauma\nit seems as if the ghosts of your past\ncome alive and try to make it all about\nthem once again\nand even if you know in your heart that\nyour partner is not the parent who hurt\nyou it may not help what kinds of trauma\ncan one experience through their lives\nand how do these traumas impact their\nromantic relationships let's explore\nfour types of trauma and their effects\non your romantic life\nrejection trauma let's start with the\ntrauma of being rejected rejection\ntrauma is born in a home where we're\nmade to feel like we don't matter try to\nthink back into your childhood were you\nalways pushed away do you feel like\nyou're not worthy of your parents time\ninstead of love and warmth you felt\nrejected you may have carried that\nfeeling with you and today you might\nfind yourself fearing rejection all over\nagain only this time you may feel\nrejected by your romantic partner\na 2015 research paper published in\ndialogues and clinical Neuroscience\nexamined emotions that occur when people\nperceive rejection in their\nrelationships according to researchers\nrejection trauma could make you feel\nhurt jealous lonely ashamed guilty\nsocially anxious and embarrassed\nall of these emotions can later\nnegatively impact your relationship and\nyour self-esteem within that\nrelationship for example psychotherapist\nAmy Morin said for very well mind that\npeople who went through rejection trauma\nMay interpret rejection as proof that\nthey are unacceptable in some way if\nyour partner is too busy to spend time\nwith you or doesn't reply to your\nmessage right away you may say to\nyourself yep I knew it they don't care\nabout me\ndo you sometimes think like this in\nsimilar situations\nthe reality might be and often is\ncompletely different but you still May\nperceive it as rejection and take it\npersonally maybe you believe that you\nonly matter if you're accepted by others\nor you might struggle with constant\nfears and worries expecting rejection to\ninevitably happen\nabandonment trauma hand in hand with\nrejection often comes abandonment as\nchildren we depend on our parents to\nfeel safe and be safe but in some cases\nour parents make the world feel unstable\nand dangerous have you experienced some\nkind of neglect or abuse that made you\nfeel unsafe at home\nmaybe it was a lack of supervision\nphysical and narcissistic abuse or\nstaying hungry all the time because you\nweren't given anything to eat when a\nchild goes through these experiences\nthey can't really understand why these\nthings are happening and often they can\nexplain this only by believing that they\ndon't actually deserve any attention or\ncare they start to believe that the\nworld is not worthy of their trust while\nthey aren't worthy of the world they\nfeel abandoned\nabandonment trauma often leads to\nformation of an anxious attachment Style\n2017 study published in current opinion\nin Psychology found that individuals\nwith an anxious attachment style may be\nhyper Vigilant and worry about their\nworthiness in a relationship and their\npartner's desire to be with them and in\nsome cases severe trauma can even cause\nthe development of personality disorders\nsuch as borderline personality disorder\npsychiatrist Mark Zimmerman wrote for\nMSD manual that fear of Abandonment is a\ncommon symptom of borderline personality\ndisorder even if you don't suffer from\nBPD you could still feel the same mix of\nemotions when you feel abandoned by your\npartner\nanger anxiousness and fear you might\nreact intensely acting jealous and\npossessive or crying your heart out\nbecause all you know is that you can't\nstand the thought of being alone again\nbetrayal trauma\nmaybe the worst thing about these\nchildhood wounds is the fact that they\nwere brought to us by the people we\ntrusted people who were supposed to love\nus more than the world people who were\nsupposed to be our superheroes\nsuffering trauma by someone you are\nclose to and depend on for support and\nsurvival is defined as betrayal trauma\nhave you been deeply betrayed by someone\nyou loved and depended on this could\nmean discovering that one of your\nparents or your partner cheated family\nmembers justifying abusive Behavior or\nmaybe one or both of your parents\nengaging in drinking or gambling instead\nof providing for you if things like\nthese happen to a child they might have\ntrouble accepting it or believing it so\nthey often just suppress it one study\nfrom 2009 published in the American\nJournal of Psychology suggests that\nthose who suffer from betrayal trauma\noften dissociate traumatic experiences\nfrom conscious awareness in order to\npreserve the relationship it's because\nthey're too dependent on their abuser to\nbelieve otherwise and once they grow up\nthey might continue the same patterns\nthey might become dependent feel\ninadequate to be on their own and decide\nto stay in toxic relationships\nthey might be too afraid to leave too\nafraid to be betrayed again so they just\nput on a happy mask and suffer in\nsilence\nhumiliation trauma\nlastly your childhood may have left you\nwith a wound of toxic shame humiliation\ntrauma\nwas there a time when your parents made\nyou feel deeply ashamed of yourself I\nmight have laughed at you for changing\nbody during puberty or mocked you for\nnot getting the highest grade in School\nin order to survive feeling ashamed and\nhumiliated you might have developed some\ncoping mechanisms that you still use to\nthis day Dr Linda hartling said for\nmodernintimacy.com that there are three\nstrategies that you might use as a way\nof dealing with toxic shame from your\nchildhood moving away moving toward or\nmoving against shame moving away from\nshame means isolating keeping secrets or\nwithdrawing from your partner moving\ntoward shame could show up as\ncodependency or people-pleasing behavior\nbecoming what you think your partner\nwants you to be even if it means losing\nyour sense of self\nand when you move against shame you\nmight try to fight those who shame you\nmaybe you use passive aggression or\ninsults to shame your partner before\nthey get the chance to shame you these\nstrategies might help you cope but they\nmight be detrimental to your\nrelationships in the long run do you\nfeel like some of these trauma
