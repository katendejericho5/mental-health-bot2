    "transcript": "love hmm that delicious and coveted\nspice that's the sauce for countless\nmagazines books podcasts and blog posts\nall about how to fall in love there are\na few ways or styles to go about\nobtaining love mainly there's the\nhealthy way then there are five other\nways that are considered not so healthy\nas defined by Dr Milan and K yerkovic in\nthe book how we love these five love\nStyles can stunt a person's growth and\nmay even harm their relationships so\ntoday we will examine the five love\nStyles in detail and discuss how we can\nimprove or even change the way we love\nbecause after all who doesn't want to\nlove better number one the pleaser the\npleaser love style pleases everyone at\ntheir own expense to the pleaser\neverything is sure I'll do that and of\ncourse I agree with you they have no\nboundaries they devalue themselves to\nthe point where it almost encourages\nothers to treat them poorly and even\nthough they are constantly exhausted and\nfrustrated they cannot seem to stop\nbecause they feel that this is the only\nway for them to be loved as a child\npleases may have been conditioned to\nexpect disproportionately negative\npunishments if they didn't please their\nparents the child learned that their\nbest way to get affection was to say I\nhave to serve everyone else to become\nbetter lovers Pleasers need to set\nboundaries and value themselves as\nequally important and worthy as anyone\nelse this will lead to them being able\nto say no and also learning how to\ncommunicate their own needs to others\nnumber two the victim children who are\nabused are considered victims they don't\nhave the means to effectively protect\nthemselves from angry or violent parents\nwho are supposed to to be the ones\nprotecting them they may find protection\nfrom Angry outbursts by taking on the\nvictim role learning that this too\nGarner sympathy or a little kindness\nfrom others as an adult this style and\nbelief in their victimhood manifests as\nI'm unhappy and Powerless to affect\nchange one way or the other poor me why\nisn't anyone rescuing me the victim\nlifestyle places the focus on themselves\nwhy me why isn't anyone helping me why\nam I suffering overcoming the victim\nmentality requires self-awareness and\nacknowledging that it is the\nindividual's responsibility to provide\nfor themselves and not place the blame\non everyone else sounds like tough work\nright but hey you gotta admit knowing\nthat you have the power to change your\nown life is pretty empowering number\nthree the vacillator vacillators ride on\nthe premise of maybe it's an the\ninconsistent swing back and forth\nbetween pulling close intimately and\npushing away abruptly this style is\ncultivated from a neglectful environment\nwhere the child feels unseen unheard and\nunimportant the same cycle repeats in\nadulthood they may fear that\nrelationships may not last or that they\nare not even able to make meaningful\nconnections this lack of assurance can\nresult in a constant swaying between\nintimacy and distance even if the\nvacillator does find a meaningful\nconnection they find that nothing lives\nup to their ideal relationship this\ncauses them to nitpick at their\npartner's imperfections while clinging\nonto them in fear of Abandonment the\nantidote to the vacillator is to take\nownership learn how to say my childhood\nwas neglectful but my partner was not\npart of that acknowledge that you sway\nbetween intimacy and distance because\nyou're afraid communicate clearly with\nyour loved ones about this Behavior this\ncan help the vacillator stop jumping to\nconclusions when trying to make\nmeaningful connections number four the\ncontroller an overly controlling\nindividual could have grown up in a home\nwhere they had little to no control for\ninstance a person with very strict\nparents could have felt that they had no\ncontrol growing up the child now an\nadult is determined to never again feel\nthat they have no control in their life\nso when there's a perceived loss of\ncontrol controllers tend to react with\nanger or feed their illusion of control\nthrough manipulation however this\ndoesn't always end well for them\nsometimes they grip too tight on their\nrelationships until their loved ones\ngrowth tired of being manipulated and\nleave the controller the control is key\nto adjusting or changing their habits is\nto challenge Their Fear practice\nacceptance and flexibility and even try\nusing helpful mantras acknowledging that\nthe old way of anger and lashing out did\nnot work and thinking of other methods\nand responses requires flexibility and\nself-awareness however we should also\nacknowledge that we are not perfect and\nthat we cannot control other people if\nyou can accept that then you can also\naccept that you have what it takes to\novercome the frustration of not being in\ncontrol and walked toward a healthy\nrelationship with others this is where\nusing mantras can help making use of a\ngoal-oriented mantra can help keep them\nin Focus as you wrestle with untangling\nyour previously set way of thinking and\nbreaking unhealthy Cycles number five\nthe avoida this is what happens when a\nchild is not only neglected but also\ncompletely deprived of love and\naffection all emotions and hurt that the\nchild expresses are treated with a shove\nto be independent and to deal deal with\nit alone as an adult they tend to avoid\nfeelings and interactions with others\nsince they were forced to go at it alone\nfrom childhood they don't trust emotions\nor other people their avoidance is for\ntheir protection the fix again comes\nwith self-awareness and an objective\nview for example if someone is actively\nand consistently finding excuses to\ndodge interaction with others chances\nare that they are displaying the traits\nof an avoida self-awareness will help\nyou observe whether their behavior is\ntruly an attempt to avoid it or just a\ncoincidence if you have a tendency to\nconstantly avoid uncomfortable\ninteractions don't be so hard on\nyourself nobody is perfect and change\ntakes time and patience if you suspect\nthat your partner is an avoider ask\nyourself how much you're willing to put\nup with it and what can be done about\nthe root of the behavior in some cases\nan objective outside perspective can can\ndo wonders try speaking to a counselor\npsychologist or therapist mental health\nprofessionals can provide you with\ninsights that can help you work toward\nchange more quickly rewiring your\nthinking and changing your habits can be\ndifficult so it's advisable to reach out\nto a professional to make sure the\napproach and effort are suitable for\nwhat you need and want if you are\nchoosing to tackle the mission to change\nthat decision to do so is probably one\nof the most difficult ones you'll have\nto make so go for it we know that all\nthe effort will be worth it do you\nrecognize any of these traits in\nyourself or others what are your\nthoughts feel free to comment and\ndiscuss below see you soon"
