    "transcript": "there are many things that can trigger\ncringe reactions for example it's\nhilarious when you see someone else's\ncringe-worthy Moment Like PewDiePie's\nterrible handshake or your friend's\nawkward flirting attempts but it can\nalso be really embarrassing when you\nexperience a cringe-worthy moment\nyourself like waving back at someone who\nwas actually waving to the person behind\nyou\ntalk about awkward this feeling of\nself-cringing is what we're gonna talk\nabout today\nwhat even is self-crunch why does it\nhappen and most importantly how do you\nstop it let's find out why cringe at\nyourself\naccording to psychologist Dr Tara\nquincerio cringe is the term often used\nto describe the physical and emotional\nreactions that occur in awkward or\nembarrassing situations\nit's not a technical term that you'd\nhear in a therapy session but it's a\nfeeling we've all had and recognized\nthere are several theories that attempt\nto understand why we feel embarrassed to\nthe point where it affects our peace of\nmind\ntake a look at a few of these theories\nsocial judges we often cringe when we\nthink back to an awkward all eyes on us\nsocial situation the social evaluation\nmodel developed by psychology Professor\nRoland S Miller has a theory about why\nwe might feel this way according to this\nmodel we evaluate ourselves and others\nbased on social comparison meaning we\ncompare ourselves to others to figure\nout our own social standing\nthe embarrassment comes from feeling\nlike we've been evaluated negatively by\nothers this can happen when we are at\nthe center of negative attention or when\nwe feel like we've made a mistake or\ndone something socially unacceptable so\nwhen a waiter tells you enjoy your meal\nand you cheerfully reply with a you too\nyou might worry that this act was\nsocially unacceptable and that's why you\nget that mortifying cringe feeling and\nwish to hide under the table\nnot a fan of myself\nyour self-esteem can play a role in how\nyou respond to self-cringe or feelings\nof embarrassment or shame too people\nwith high self-esteem tend to have a\npositive view of themselves and may be\nmore resilient in the face of\nself-cringe more embarrassing situations\nthey often see their mistakes as\nopportunities to learn and grow but if\nyour self-esteem is low you may be more\nlikely to feel embarrassed or ashamed\nwhen you do something cringe-worthy and\nmay be more sensitive to criticism or\nnegative feedback that's when you may\nstart to dwell on your mistakes and\nreplay them in your mind all night long\nlike it's a cringe party\nthe opposite is also true cringe-worthy\nmemories can lower your self-esteem a\n2002 study published in the British\nJournal of Clinical Psychology found\nthat when individuals experience shame\nthey might feel like their whole person\nis suddenly devalued which lowers their\nself-esteem frequently experiencing\nshame can eventually develop into a\ntrait of Shame which involves negative\nand often painful feelings such as\ninferiority despair helplessness and the\ndesire to hide personal flaws\nneeding everything to be perfect might\nexacerbate these feelings too\njust right\nif you're a perfectionist you might know\nthat feeling of needing everything to be\njust right if it's not here comes the\ncringe again Studies have shown that\nthere really is a link between\nperfectionism and embarrassment for\nexample a 2009 study published in the\nJournal of sport and exercise psychology\nexamined this link with young athletes\nresearchers found that fear of\nexperiencing shame and embarrassment is\nCentral in the relationship between\nperfectionism and fear of failure\nhow can perfectionism influence your\nself-cringe perfectionism can cause you\nto set high standards for yourself fear\nfailure and view any mistakes or flaws\nas unacceptable\nwhen you are unable to meet these\nstandards or experience failure you may\nfeel inadequate and experience negative\nemotions such as self-criticism shame\nincreased stress or anxiety\nhow to stop no matter how cringe-worthy\nsome of the things you've done may seem\nremember that it's totally normal to\nmake mistakes instead of stressing out\nabout past embarrassing moments try to\nlearn from your experiences and embrace\nyourself Just As You Are\none way to do this is by developing\nshame resilience which is all about\nrecognizing and understanding shame and\nseeking support when you need it Renee\nBrown a research professor and author is\nthe one who came up with this concept\nshe says that to become shame resilient\nit's important to have a clear\nunderstanding of what shame is and how\nit can impact you\nand you've already taken that first step\nby learning more about the origins of\ncringe good job in addition to shame\nresilience try practicing\nself-compassion to help cope with\nshameful thoughts a 2018 study published\nin the journal mindfulness found that\npracticing self-compassion can\nsignificantly reduce shame proneness\nirrational beliefs and social anxiety\nsymptoms in undergrad students to\npractice self-compassion try writing a\ncompassionate letter to yourself\nfocusing on gratitude and self-care and\nusing positive self-talk but if you're\nstill struggling with embarrassing\nmoments and feel like you can't do it\nalone it might be helpful to talk to a\nmental health professional for some\nextra support\nit's easy to lose yourself in all those\nembarrassing moments but if you choose\nit to be self-cringe can also be a\nreminder to be more compassionate and\nunderstanding towards yourself rather\nthan dwelling on your flaws or mistakes\nso the next time you feel that awkward\nembarrassing feeling take a moment to\nreflect on what you can learn from it\nembrace your quirks and remember\nnobody's perfect and that is totally\nfine and don't forget you matter until\nnext time thanks for watching"
