    "transcript": "parents give me some of the most\ninfluential people in one's life however\nit's a whole new ball game if one or\nboth of your parents happen to be\nnarcissistic because then it's all about\nthe narcissist instead of teaching you\nit's more like forcing their beliefs on\nyou and when you don't agree they may\nbelittle you causing you to believe\npretty awfully untrue things about\nyourself let's chat about seven beliefs\nthat you may have if you were raised by\nnarcissistic parents\nnumber one I'm not good enough in 2018 a\nstudy on narcissistic parenting was\nconducted with 198 participants of those\n198 106 believed one or both of their\nparents to be narcissistic also these\n106 participants had significantly\nhigher scores relating to depression and\nlower scores related to self-esteem than\nthe other 92 participants what does this\nmean for you narcissism in parents can\nlead to Children displaying signs of\ndepression or depression paired with low\nself-esteem so it is possible that such\ndiagnoses can be the result of\nnarcissistic parenting number two if I\ndon't have your approval I'm wrong with\na narcissist whatever they do and\nhowever they do it is the correct and\nbest way to do that thing\nif Ariel were a narcissist parent she'd\ninsist everyone who brushes their hair\nwith anything but a dingle hopper is\nwrong when apparent is narcissistic and\nthey see you doing saying or even\nbelieving something different than they\ndo kind of like with boundaries The\nNarcissist will do or say anything to\nget you to abandon your way of doing\nthings the narcissist likes to make you\ninto almost an extension of them no\nseparation so when you're just using\nalternative ways of doing or living to\nthem you're telling them they're wrong a\nnarcissist can't handle this made-up\nfeeling of rejection so they place that\nwrongness on you number three I am\neveryone's caretaker when a parent is\nnarcissistic it's their world we're just\nlucky to live in it that need to be the\ncenter of attention reverses the typical\nparent child role this results in the\nchild's becoming a caretaker intending\nto the parent and their emotions like a\nparent should author and PhD marjalis\nphilstad States in her book stop\ncaretaking the borderline or narcissist\nhow to end the drama and get on with\nlife\nthat you may recognize this person in\nyour friend group as the mom or dad of\nthe group they're driven by the belief\nthat they need to care for everyone\naround and make everything okay this can\nbe the result of a narcissistic parent\nignoring you intending to themselves or\nforcing you to parent them number four I\nneed to be more than I am a narcissistic\nparent puts value on you for what you do\nrather than Who You Are they may praise\nyou and how you get all A's in class to\nother parents but when you look closely\nthey're not saying how proud they are of\nyour intelligence they're saying they're\nproud of you for performing well and\nmaking them look good\nthis belief that you're only good when\ndoing or accomplishing is ingrained in\nthe child early on\nso as you grow older\nbelieve that you're valued only for your\naccomplishments turns into perfectionism\nthis can lead to an unhealthy attachment\nstyle in future romantic relationships\nbut the truth is you're not loved for\nwhat you do you're left for who you are\nnumber five my priorities make me\nselfish\neveryone else is more important than\nyourself period this is what a\nnarcissistic parent makes a child\nbelieve in they don't allow for\nboundaries to be established boundaries\nare important and they're healthy\nhowever if they do not benefit the\nnarcissistic parent they will do\nwhatever they can to either get you to\ndrop that boundary or they might ignore\nit all together feel stat makes a point\nin her book that narcissistic parents\nview their children as an extension of\nthemselves a boundary or personal\npriority forces the parent to see that\nyou are two different people to get you\nto drop the boundary the narcissistic\nparent May label you as selfish rude or\neven ask you how you could do that to\nthem they might even throw in the ever\npopular but I raised you\nif you're taking care of personal needs\nthose come first you can't pour from an\nempty cup number six my emotions make me\ndramatic\nhave you ever stood up to a narcissistic\nparent since I know someone who did\nwe'll call them Casey when Casey let\ntheir parents know how hurt and abused\nthey felt their parents didn't quite\nagree Casey was told they were dramatic\nand that they weren't perfect either\ntheir parents refused to acknowledge\nthat they ever treated Casey poorly they\neven accused Casey of making things up\nfor attention Casey knew this wasn't the\ntruth and knew they had to go no contact\nsure they may ground you every now and\nthen but there's a difference between\nparenting and emotional abuse this is\nagain your parents feelings of rejection\ncoming up and them not being able to\ncope with it if you speak up and aren't\nbeing listened to more likely dismissed\nthis could be a sign of a narcissistic\nparent and number seven I don't have\nanything to contribute you and your\nparents are talking about the new\nrestaurant you all want to go to and You\nBegin raving about how good your meal\nwas what would a narcissistic parent do\nif they don't agree they may tell you\nthat your palate is awful or you don't\nknow food they're quick to negate and\noppose anything you might be saying by\nmaking you question your own self and\nwhether you're talking about\ncontributing to a cause a conversation a\ngroup project or a romantic relationship\nThe Narcissist needs to always be the\nbest the number one the head honcho\ncan be about any topic but if the\nnarcissist feels undermined or\nintimidated by you they'll make you feel\nlike you have nothing of value to add to\nany situation you're in which isn't true\nat all remember when a negative thought\npops up ask yourself whose words are\nthese are they mine or my parents having\nnarcissistic parents can really take a\ntoll on you especially in adulthood the\nearlier you notice the signs the quicker\nyou can begin your healing Journey\ntake it from someone who is literally\nliving this healing Journey right now it\nis possible to get to a better place it\nmay mean something different for\neveryone but it is possible\nthank you for watching as always keep an\neye on side for more psychico content\nneed more information on narcissism\ncheck out five signs of narcissistic\nabuse"
