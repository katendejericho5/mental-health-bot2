    "transcript": "neuroscientist Lisa Feldman Barrett has\na fascinating book how emotions are made\nthe secret life of the brain this book\nturns what you might know about how the\nbrain works on its head and there's been\na few mind-blowing and jaw-dropping\nrealizations of how your brain works and\nhow it helps make us who we are our\nhuman nature in this video we'll be\ndiscussing something that Dr Barrett\ncalls effective realism\nwhat is effective realism effective\nrealism is basically how what we feel on\nthe inside affects what or how we\nperceive our reality it literally\ninfluences and changes what we think we\nsee and it also has an effect not affect\non our decision making which can impact\nour own lives and those of others which\nis kind of scary when you think about it\nin her book one of the examples she\ntalks about was judges in Israel making\ndecisions in court before lunch when\nthey're hungry their internal feeling of\nbeing hungry actually affected their\nsentencing of defendants and not in a\npositive way but after they had had\ntheir lunch then they were back to\npardoning people as frequently as before\nin a definition from Wikipedia affect in\nPsychology refers to the underlying\nexperience of feeling emotion or mood\nyou may have heard people who are\nemotionless like say for example some\nserial killers who have no emotional\nreaction to what they've done as having\na flat effect\nIve realism affect how we see the world\naccording to an article by Anthony\nCostner about how Barrett talks about\neffective realism he writes that our\nfeelings cause us to view the world in a\ncertain way whether that is objective\nreality or not he quotes Barrett who\nsays essentially how we feel about the\nworld creates our thoughts about things\nfor example she says I feel negative so\nsomething bad must be happening it's\nkind of the reverse of what we think\nhappens when we experience reality we\nthink something bad is happening so\nthat's why we feel bad\neffective realism affects how we act on\na website for Barrett's book how\nemotions are made.com she says that\nmarketing depends on the effect of\nthings like effective realism apparently\npeople drink more and are willing to pay\nmore for a beverage if they see smiling\nfaces though aren't aware of seeing the\nfaces as in subliminal messaging\ntechniques\neffective realism affects what we feel\naccording to an article by Barrett and\ncolleagues they write how people's\nemotions moods feelings AKA affect are\nintertwined with how they experience the\nworld and actually affect how people see\nthings such as a neutral face if people\nare experiencing positivity they're more\nlikely to see a neutral face in a\npositive light this study is discussed\nagain in an article by PubMed Barrett\nand colleagues ran tests where they\nshowed smiling angry or neutral faces in\na way that wasn't consciously aware of\nthem and when they were shown neutral\nfaces at before at the same time and\nafter when people saw the neutral faces\npaired with The Smiling Faces they\nweren't aware of or the scowling phases\nthey also didn't know they were seeing\nthey'd read the neutral faces as more\npositive or trustworthy than the\ninvisible angry faces effective realism\naffects what we think in a fascinating\nNew York Times article from 2015 called\nwhen a gun is not a gun\nit talks about shootings by police\nofficers in Philadelphia over an\neight-year period and how in 15 percent\nof the cases the victims were unarmed\nand in half of those the officer thought\nthat a normal object like a cell phone\nor a specific movement like putting\ntheir hand in their pocket for example\nwas misidentified as a threat as being a\ngun or weapon and then shot the person\nthough there are many reasons for\nshootings one of them may be effective\nrealism which is where your feelings or\nemotions have an impact on what you see\nand perceive is going on in your\nenvironment or experience your brain\nreacts to how your body is feeling\naccording to the world as we feel it\nblog it mentions that our feelings and\ntherefore how we respond and react I.E\nsocialization theories are influenced by\nour past experiences so police officers\npast experiences could be seeing people\nwith weapons and the brain is a\npredictive organ so they predict they\nsee guns where there aren't any because\nthat's what they're used to experiencing\ndangerous\neffective realism impacts how we act\nfeel and think Adam Schneider a writer\nfor sure people explains then how we\nfeel can have an impact on how we act\nand think this reminds me of acceptance\nand commitment therapy how we think feel\nand behave are all interlinked he says\nthat according to Lisa Feldman Barrett's\nTed Talk cultivating wisdom the power of\nmood that your brain is naturally wired\nto adjust its perspective based on your\nmood in turn you come to believe what\nyou feel and that is what effective\nrealism is all about how we think and\nhow we feel is sometimes\nindistinguishable it seems\nit's like the Chicken and the Egg what\ncomes first Ash Schneider mentions\nsometimes our emotions feelings mood\ninfluence or cause our thoughts other\ntimes it's the opposite and what we\nthink influences how we feel about\nsomething that's why positive psychology\nwhich looks at things through a positive\nlens can help us to become more\nresilient when we look at things\npositively and combine that with\npositive emotions it can make you feel\nlike you can accomplish anything whereas\nwhen the opposite occurs you're thinking\nnegatively as well as feeling negative\nor in a negative mood this can be\ndetrimental to your overall well-being\nforeign"
