still a tough one\nand dealing with this exhaustion, ugh,\nit makes you feel tired\neven thinking about it.\nBut what could it be that makes\nyou feel tired all the time?\nIn this video,\nwe hope to explain some common reasons why\npeople often get tired, and in the end\nwe'll talk about Sigh\nand how he managed to get\nhis tiredness under control.\nLet's begin.\nA tired mind.\nOften fatigue may be a byproduct\nof a psychological problem,\nespecially depression.\nPsychiatrist and sleep\nmedicine expert Alex Dimitriu\nsays that fatigue and depression\ncan look quite similar.\nA 2018 study even estimated that over 90%\nof people living with depression\nhave symptoms of fatigue.\nDr. Amy Rickey said for Insider\nthat this may happen\nbecause of brain chemistry.\nShe says that dopamine, serotonin,\nand norepinephrine play important roles\nin regulating not only your\nmood, but also energy levels.\nSo when you're depressed, your\nbody may feel heavy and slow,\nmaking it hard to do\neven the simplest tasks,\nsuch as showering or getting dressed.\nCheck out this video to learn more\nabout depression tiredness.\nAnxiety is another psychological issue\nthat could play a role in your fatigue.\nWhile you're in the depths\nof anxiety, the racing heart\nand quickened breath might keep you awake,\nbut after the worst is over,\nyou are hit with a post-anxiety crash.\nMicah Abraham, who has a\nbachelor of science in psychology\nwrote for Calm Clinic\nthat anxiety is like being on high alert,\nbut once the adrenaline\nruns out, your body goes\nthrough a crash that can\nleave you feeling drained.\nYou may also feel exhausted because\nof the tension in your muscles\nor racing thoughts that\nbothered you throughout the day.\nMental illness could\ndefinitely make you more tired,\nbut sometimes the problem\nmay be a bit different.\nLet's explore why your\nnutrition might be the reason\nwhy you're so sleepy all the time.\nWhat's on your plate?\nDo you know that feeling\nwhen you eat a delicious meal\nand suddenly you feel so sleepy?\nYou just wanna get under a warm blanket\nand take an afternoon nap.\nIt's awesome when it's\nSunday in your home,\nbut what if you're at work or school,\nand what if this tiredness\npersists the entire day?\nWell, the food you eat\nmight be responsible\nfor this grogginess,\nespecially carbohydrates.\nAccording to Harvard's\nSchool of Public Health,\neating too many carbs makes\nyour blood sugar spike,\ncreating a short term energy rush.\nYour body then releases\ninsulin and causes the removal\nof carbs into your muscles and organs.\nNow your blood sugar goes back down,\nleaving you lethargic and tired.\nSugary sweets may have a similar effect.\nIn a study published in\nJournal Appetite in 2016,\npeople who ate a diet\nhigh in refined sugars\nhad higher scores\nfor depressive symptoms and fatigue\nthan those who ate a\ndiet high in whole grains\nand low in sugar.\nYes, we know that\nchocolate cake is the best,\nbut science is clear on this one.\nWhat you drink may play a role\nin your energy levels as well.\nDo you often reach for\ncoffee when you're tired?\nIt seems logical to try\nand cure your tiredness with\na large amount of coffee,\nbut research shows it\nmight not be the best idea.\nA 2016 study published\nin the journal Nutrition\nshowed that drinking one\ncup too many is linked\nto increased nighttime\nworrying, sleeplessness,\nincreased nighttime awakenings,\ndecreased total sleep time,\nand daytime sleepiness.\nTips and tricks to feel less tired.\nYou must be wondering, well, what do I do?\nHow can I stop feeling tired all the time?\nTo give you some tips and tricks,\nlet's see what Sigh did when\nhe had a similar problem.\nWell, he started with\nsmall steps in his diet.\nDr. Amy Myers wrote on her webpage\nthat nutrient-rich foods may\nprovide an abundance of energy.\nThat's why Sigh now makes\nsure to eat balanced\nand nutritious meals, high\nquality protein, lots of veggies,\nespecially greens such\nas spinach and broccoli,\nand low sugar foods.\nFor example, strawberries or blackberries.\nSnack times are quite a challenge\nsince he loves eating chocolate,\nbut Dr. Myers says that an\nentire block of chocolate\nis not a good idea for a pick-me-up snack.\nHe still eats chocolate,\nbut only a small piece.\nNext, Sigh makes sure\nto drink enough water\nthroughout the day and he\ndoesn't skip exercise anymore.\nHe read a 2013 research study published\nin the Journal Fatigue,\nBiomedicine, Health and Behavior,\nand learned that even 20 minutes\nof low to moderate intensity\nexercise can reduce fatigue\nand increase energy.\nHe often puts on fun\nYouTube exercise videos\nto help him get going.\nSometimes it gets hard for\nSigh to get up in the morning\nbut he read a quote from\nSleep Specialist Rebecca Scott\non Thrillist.com where she says\nthat about 10 to 15 minutes\nof natural light within\ntwo hours of waking up\nwill help ward off\nearly morning grogginess\nand keep you feeling more\nawake throughout the day.\nHe now takes quick 15 minute walks\naround the block every day.\nSigh now knows\nthat it's not enough to only\nkeep the body energized.\nHe takes care of his mental energy too.\nOn Forbes.com, he read some suggestions\nfrom Dr. Alice Boyes.\nNow he tries his best not\nto ruminate and overthink\nand stay organized to\navoid procrastination.\nHe also takes frequent breaks during work\nand has even tried meditation.\nAfter trying out all those things,\nhe really does feel more\nenergized and happy.\nHopefully you'll join\nhim on this journey too.\nFollowing these steps might\nhelp you feel more energized,\nbut there's so many other\nthings that could be\nemptying your batteries.\nTo make
