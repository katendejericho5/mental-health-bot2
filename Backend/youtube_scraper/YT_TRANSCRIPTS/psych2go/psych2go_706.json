    "transcript": "when you think of abuse what comes to\nmind\nphysical abuse is usually the first\nthought but not all abuse is physical\nmental abuse is a form of manipulation\nand control intended to undermine one's\nself-esteem and make them feel isolated\ntake Cinderella as an example of a\nvictim of mental abuse isolated by her\nstepsisters and stepmother and forced to\ndo their bidding Cinderella found no\nhope even within her own family\nthe most difficult part about mental\nabuse is that it can go on for a long\nperiod of time because of the lack of\nphysical indications intervention is\nmuch less likely to occur\naccording to Jerry Stein's sidey\nemotional abuse goes undetected\nminimized and dismissed by the abuser\nvictims and others not only this but\nmentally abused people are likely to put\nthemselves in additional abusive\nsituations\naccording to counselor Andrea Matthews\nthose exposed to mental abuse in their\nchildhood May accept abusive Behavior as\nsomething normal and be prone to\nentering abusive relationships without\neven realizing that the abuse they\nendure is very wrong knowing whether\nyou're a victim of mental abuse is the\nfirst step to helping yourself identify\nthe people around you in your past or in\nthe present who might be your abusers\nthis is especially important as mental\nabuse can take a toll on one's mental\nand physical health\nso with that here are five signs that\nyou've been mentally abused and don't\nknow it\nnumber one\nempathy error in 2017 a group of\nresearchers from the University of\nBerlin found that early life stress such\nas emotional neglect and mental abuse\ncan cause genetic changes to the\nhippocampus which can make it more\ndifficult to empathize with others\nemotions\nsince the hippocampus is involved with\nunconscious processing of relational\ninformation it is the central structure\nfor emotional empathy experiences let's\nsay a friend is really upset because\ntheir pet has just passed if your\nhippocampus is fully operational you may\nsay something like oh I'm so sorry I\ncan't even imagine how you feel you're\nletting your friend know you understand\nhow they feel and you're there for them\nif you're a victim of mental abuse you\nmay say something nice because you know\nyou should or make an inappropriate\ncomment or might not say anything at all\nnow if you've never experienced a pet\npassing away you may not be able to\nrelate and that's okay\nbut if you find it hard to empathize\nwith someone's feelings this could be a\nsign of past mental abuse number two low\nself-esteem\ndo you find it hard to boost your\nself-confidence and always doubt\nyourself\nif you've been subject to mental abuse\nyou have consistently been put down\nwhich contributed to a negative\nself-image\na study on self-esteem and Adolescence\nby researchers from the Hubert kairuki\nMemorial University found that\npsychological maltreatment and\nself-esteem are negatively correlated\nthis study also found that victims of\nmental abuse tend to believe that they\nhave little or no value to those around\nthem\nor even the world\nthey may also think that the world is\nunsafe and believe many others will\nabuse them as well\nif you're someone who usually thinks\nlower of yourself\nthink back\ndo you have someone around that\nconstantly puts you down\nyou may be a victim of mental abuse\nnumber three yes to all when someone\ncares about you in any capacity they\ndon't want to see you upset or\ncontrolled\naccording to psychologist Jay Reid\nself-absorbed caregivers may be a root\nof why one might need to please others\nthe mental abuse they give might make\nyou believe that others needs come\nbefore your own they want you to believe\nyou're lesser than so you're always\ntrying to do more to gain their approval\ndo you find yourself needing to be\nperfect for others in every way to be\naccepted and loved let's say there's one\ncookie left in the pack your mental\nabuser comes in and says you're gonna\neat that\nyou could say no so they can eat it and\nthis could make them happy which means\nthey may not say something mean to you\nif you say yes you might be called\ninconsiderate or rude\nthat urge to please others can be\nanother sign of mental abuse\nnumber four\nself-doubt when you say or do something\nhow confident are you that you're\ncorrect\nwe can't be right all the time but\nmental abuse can cause you to question\nyour sanity and sense of reality\nwe know this as gaslighting according to\nAndrea Matthews LPC NCC gaslighting is a\nmain form of control for abusers because\nit can deflect blame and cause one to\nbelieve that they are at fault if you've\nbeen frequently gaslit in the past you\nmight have low confidence in your\nabilities and subject yourself to a lot\nof self-doubt you might also not trust\nyourself or your instincts as a result\nof being in a mentally abusive situation\nand number five\nfatigue\ndo you find yourself feeling exhausted\nalmost all the time I don't mean tired\nlike I need a cup of coffee to wake me\nup I mean actual fatigue where if you\nlie down you would actually pass out\nwhile one might not expect that mental\nabuse can affect and drain someone\nphysically it certainly can a study from\nKU Lovin in 2001 found a correlation\nbetween people who have experienced\nchildhood emotional abuse and neglect\nand having chronic fatigue syndrome or\nfibromyalgia during adulthood mental\nabuse they found may increase\nvulnerability to chronic fatigue\nsyndrome and fibromyalgia due to altered\npain perception and the burden of an\noveractive lifestyle that has to\nregulate inner tension and compensate\nfor low self-esteem if you have chronic\nfatigue or pain and have been seen by a\nmedical professional there is a\npossibility that you've been mentally\nabused mental abusers may not leave a\nscar a bruise or a physical marker that\nthey've done damage this is why it can\nbe so difficult to identify and handle\nmental abuse until it's serious\nthese aren't the only effects of mental\nabuse but they are some of the more\ncommon ones when exposed to mental abuse\nfor long periods of time if you know of\nany other signs of mental abuse that we\ndidn't mention let us know in the\ncomments as always we recommend reaching\nout to a mental health professional if\nyou've experienced abuse in any form see\nyou next time"
