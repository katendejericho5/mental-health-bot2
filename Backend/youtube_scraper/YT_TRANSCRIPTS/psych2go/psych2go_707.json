    "transcript": "how do you see yourself\nin today's world with the media and\ninternet often showing us images of what\nwe should want or desire to look like\nit's no wonder so many people often\nreport having negative feelings towards\ntheir bodies a psychology Professor Dr\nNicole K McNichols PhD explains in an\narticle for psychology today that 90 of\nwomen and 20 to 40 percent of men report\nbody dissatisfaction at the same time\nthere is a significant link between poor\nbody image and low libido and low sexual\nsatisfaction so where's the connection\nlie McNichols explains that one reason\nwe may over analyze our body in the\ncontext of sex is due to what she calls\nspectatoring this process was suggested\nby research Team Masters and Johnson in\n1970. it happens when one basically gets\ntrapped in their own head over analyzing\nand viewing themselves from a third\nperson perspective during sexual\nactivities instead of being in the\nsexual moment before them they view\nthemselves as a spectator critical of\nthemselves instead of focusing on the\nsensations they may be feeling McNichols\nexplains\nspectatoring ruins the joy inherent to\nsex by diverting attention away from any\npleasurable sexual Sensations as well as\na partner's erotic cues the effect then\ntakes a deep downward spiral a person's\npsychological disassociation from their\nbody keeps them from enjoying sex which\nin turn fuels further feelings of doubt\nand insecurity in men this can also lead\nto Performance anxiety and erectile\ndysfunction and remember that 90 figure\n90 of women report body dissatisfaction\nwhich may just affect them more\nespecially in the bedroom as sex\ntherapist Laura J Watson PhD explains\nthat especially women more often have\ntwo types of body image issues that can\naffect them in the bedroom so what are\nthey one how they see themselves if\nyou're often critically viewing your\nbody and getting lost in a negative\nthought process instead of getting lost\nin the moment this may increase your\nanxiety regarding engaging in sexual\nactivity and anxiety often doesn't help\nget you in the mood sex therapist Dr\nLaurie J Watson explains in an article\nfor psychology today that if a woman\nfeels like her body is unattractive it\nleads to lower sexual self-esteem which\nthen often leads to avoidance of sexual\nactivity once one area of the sexual\ncycle is interrupted often several areas\nof the sexual cycle are disrupted desire\narousal and orgasm but wait does size\nmatter one common critical question\npeople may ask themselves in the bedroom\ndoes size matter your critical thoughts\ncan rest a study published in the\njournal psychology of men and\nmasculinity mentioned on Lloyd's\nPharmacy online doctor suggested that\nmales attribute more importance to penis\nsize than their female Partners the\nstudy States whereas 85 percent of women\nwere satisfied with their partner's\npenis size only 55 percent of men were\nsatisfied with their penis size\ngenerally what's more largely found to\nbe important to women is a partner who\nis tender and caring or knowing what\nyour partner wants discovering how your\npartner likes to be touched and caressed\ntends to make for better sex two how\nthey think others see them another thing\nthat may influence your sexual\nfunctioning how you believe others view\nyou and your body results from a 2021\nstudy published in the journal\nPersonality and Social Psychology\nbulletin suggests this as well the\nresearch which included two studies\nstated that across both studies women\nwith poorer body image perceived their\npartner to be less attracted to them\nirrespective of their partner's actual\nattraction to them or how attracted they\nwere to their partner which in turn was\nassociated with lower relationship and\nsexual satisfaction but what about for\nmen for men attraction to their partner\nwas consistently associated with their\nown relationship satisfaction the study\nsuggests this is all due to projection\nbiases think about it if you've been\nplaying with the idea that you're\nunattractive or that your partner isn't\nattracted to you even if they are this\nmay just make it harder for you to\napproach them sexually the study also\nhad interesting results highlighting the\ndifferences between the male\nparticipants results and the female\nparticipants results Psychology today\nauthor Arash amanzadeh summarizes the\nresults in his article stating that\nconcerning relationship satisfaction and\nsexual satisfaction What mattered most\nto the women in the study were their\nfeelings about their own body rather\nthan their attraction to their romantic\npartner for men attraction to their\nromantic partner was What mattered the\nmost because it was positively linked\nwith their relationship satisfaction and\nsexual satisfaction and in the second\ninvestigation even with the Romantic\npartner's sexual satisfaction many\npeople's focus and Body Image\ninsecurities are different in each\nsexual context but if you want to\nimprove your body image and its effects\non sex there are some things that may\nhelp you improving body image\ntext therapist Lori J Watson recommends\nthat you decrease negative self-talk\nbefore and during sex how every time\nthose negative thoughts or feelings\narise before or during sex she\nrecommends to remind yourself that you\nare entitled to sexual pleasure and that\nsex will bring you more closeness and\nbonding with your partner she also\nrecommends practicing mindfulness as\nthoughts arise face them with curiosity\nand let them pass without accepting them\nas one hundred percent truth Watson\nsuggests that you don't let yourself\njudge the feeling or thought just let it\nreside in your mind and be curious about\nit as we question our thoughts and\nfeelings we learn that they are only\nthoughts and feelings they are not\nconcrete reality another tip that might\nhelp is to be around those who aren't\nhyper focused on their bodies in\nconversation do you have a friend who\nalways comments on your body or features\nor maybe they Place extreme importance\non theirs so body image takes the focus\noften in your discussions with them\npsychology Professor Dr Nicole K\nMcNichols suggests you not only be\naround those who have interest beyond\ntheir physical features but to to also\nfocus on things that remind you of how\ngreat a person you are develop a sense\nof confidence self-acceptance and\nopenness from other things that
