    "transcript": "sticks and stones may break my bones but\nwords will never hurt me is that really\ntrue this is often said in relation\nprecisely after somebody tells us\nsomething hurtful\nwords can wound and they can become\nabusive and wear you down over time the\nAmerican Psychological Association\ndefines verbal abuse as extremely\ncritical threatening or insulting words\ndelivered in oral or written form and\nintended to demean belittle or frighten\nthe recipient it can be difficult to\ndetermine whether you are in a verbally\nabusive relationship let alone walk away\nfrom one you might feel conflicted\nwhenever you remember the other person's\ngood qualities in the happy times you\nshared with them abuse is not as\nstraightforward as it can seem in the\nmedia although some television shows and\nmovies nowadays portray aspects of it\nthat are more realistically complex on\nthe show Euphoria we witness Nate's\nabusive Behavior towards Maddie he is\nshort-tempered and when angered speaks\nto her in a commanding and spiteful way\nhe has no problem calling her offensive\nslurs and he frequently yells and swears\nat her on the other hand Nate and Maddie\nare also seen laughing and having fun\ntogether being physically affectionate\nquietly confiding in each other and\nexchanging I love yous the contrast\ngives us a glimpse into a victim\nconflicted feelings and why some keep\ngoing back to their abuser their own\nNate in real life it can be just as\ndifficult to see your own relationships\nclearly but it can help to equip\nyourself with a better understanding of\nwhat verbal abuse is and what it can\nlook like in day-to-day life so with\nthat said here are five signs of verbal\nabuse number one criticism constructive\nor destructive does someone in your life\ncomment endlessly on your intelligence\nappearance or even your mannerisms they\nmight tell you that nobody likes you or\nmake you believe that your own friends\nand family secretly hate you according\nto an article published in the Journal\nof taiba University Medical Sciences\nverbally abusive criticism involves a\ncertain level of judgment and blame that\ncan leave you feeling inferior and\nashamed of who you are when the audience\nfirst meets Maddie she talks about how\nNate ruined her confidence she nitpicks\nat her appearance even as her friends\nassure her that she is very attractive\nshe explains that she feels disgusting\nbecause Nate constantly criticized\neverything about her this is our first\nsign that he was being verbally abusive\nlater Nate attributes Maddie's Behavior\nto her being crazy when in truth her\nactions are largely a response to his\nown mistreatment of her similarly an\nabuser might tell you that you are too\nsensitive and immature that you're going\nout of your mind or that you take\neverything too seriously by doing this\nthey're discounting your feelings and\nyour own truth critical comments can\nalso be well intended your partner May\nbelieve that they're only trying to help\nbut when their criticisms are persistent\nand harsh they can be more damaging than\nconstructive\ntwo hurtful names\ndoes your parent or partner call you\nnames\nnot harmless nicknames or pet names but\nnames that are really just insults these\nmight be outright accusations like\ncalling you stupid or spoiled these may\nalso come in the form of derogatory\nslurs as was the case with Nate and\nMaddie on Euphoria you may have also\nexperienced more subtle but equally\nhurtful name-calling for instance an\nabuser might mockingly call you a victim\nor a martyr psychology and philosophy\nexpert Dr Barrett brogard wrote that the\nkey difference between harmless and\nharmful noon calling lies and the effect\nit has on you and your self-esteem are\nthese names playful or do they leave you\nfeeling wounded vulnerable worthless if\nit's more of the latter you may be\nexperiencing verbal abuse number three\nyelling and swearing does someone in\nyour life scream or curse at you on a\nregular basis do they often yell at you\nto shut up everyone loses their temper\nsometimes but it's important to assess\nwhether this has become a common\noccurrence in your relationship\non Euphoria raised voices seem to be the\nnorm for communication between Nate and\nMaddie rather than the exception your\npartner may have told you that you\ndeserved it that they have experienced\nmuch worse or that this behavior is\ncommon and acceptable Dr brogard wrote\nthat nobody deserves to be yelled at and\nshe emphasizes that any form of yelling\nand swearing is verbally abusive\nespecially if it's done out of context\nnumber four laughing with you or at you\nit was just a joke don't take everything\nso seriously\nis there something you hear often you\nmay have heard this after you reacted to\na cruel joke that an abuser said to you\nthey may have ridiculed you either in\nprivate or in public which can be even\nmore painful according to Patricia Evans\ncommunication specialist and leading\nexpert on verbal abuse abusers may try\nto disguise insults as jokes but this\ndoes not excuse the upsetting things\nthey say typically these jokes will be\nabout your personal issues and\ninsecurities\nif you're hurting from their jokes\ninstead of enjoying them then they've\ncrossed the boundary between playful\nbanter and actual verbal abuse\nnumber five under control\naccording to Evans a verbal abuser May\norder you around as if your decisions\nwere Theirs to control\nyour partner might tell you how to spend\nyour money and time or attempt to\ndictate what you should or shouldn't eat\nor wear\naside from this a verbal abuser might\nexhibit control by a way of threats they\nmight threaten to leave you or take\npeople away from you it may even go as\nfar as to threaten to harm you or your\nloved ones communication specialist\nPatricia Evans clarifies that threats\ndon't have to be drastic an abuser may\nhave warned you on numerous occasions\nthat other people will think or in their\nwords find out that you're a foolish or\nselfish if you don't do as they say as a\nresult victims may end up stuck trapped\nin a paradox of feeling afraid of their\nabuser and yet still too afraid to leave\nthem words are intangible but powerful\nand hurtful words can become poisonous\nas you start to believe them\nsuch as the case with verbal abuse it\ncan leave you feeling worn out and weak\nas it gradually diminishes your\nself-esteem\ntry to take a step back from your\nrelationships and see if you can\nidentify these signs of verbal abuse in\nthem remember that happy moments in a\nrelationship do not absolve the abuse\nthat happens within it and you deserve\nto be treated with kindness and respect\nif you're struggling to heal and move\nforward from abuse please do not\nhesitate to reach out to a qualified\nmental health professional for help\nif you found this video helpful be sure\nto
