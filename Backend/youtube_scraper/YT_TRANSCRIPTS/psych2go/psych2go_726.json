    "transcript": "hi\nso when people think of schizophrenia\nthey typically think of the symptoms\nthat present with it so things like\nhallucinations delusions disorganized\nthinking and the list goes on\nbut I think it's just as important to\nacknowledge schizophrenia beyond the\ndiagnostic label because ultimately\nschizophrenia is a mental health\ndisorder that affects how a person\nrelates to themselves how they relate to\ntheir Social Circle and ultimately how\nthey relate to society\nso that's really our main focus for the\ndiscussion today really taking a social\napproach on how schizophrenia can impact\na person's relationship that they have\nwith Society\nso for those who are just joining us for\nthe first time welcome I'm just gonna\ngive a really brief introduction to\nmyself and a bit about the series which\nis the ask and expert series\nI'm Monica I'm the host of the ask an\nexpert series and I'm a neuroscience\ngraduate and a current medical student\nI'm really keen on all things Psychiatry\nand neurology so I created this series\nto really tackle the medical information\nthat is sometimes prevalent in\nPsychiatry and in neurology so if you're\nalso really keen on this kind of thing\nthen you can get in touch with me\ncontact information is in the\ndescription box below\num but moving on I just wanted to also\ntake the opportunity to introduce you\nall to our very special guest today Alex\nwho is a social worker today we'll be\ndiscussing everything related to the um\nsocial impacts of schizophrenia so\nwelcome Alex\nhello hi hello\nI'm Alex I'm a licensed social worker\nI've been one for eight years now and\nI've studied social work at the\nbachelor's and the Master's level I also\nhave a bachelor's in psychology I have a\ncertificate in Healthcare Management and\nI'm currently a first-year medical\nstudent as well and my work experiences\nmainly with adults who are living with\nschizophrenia in a specialized\npsychiatric hospital\nthank you so much for the introduction\ngiven your expertise in schizophrenia\nand given that the audience might be\ncoming from a diverse range of\nbackgrounds would you like to start by\nperhaps giving a rundown about what is\nschizophrenia what are the some come\nsome kind of symptoms that people can\npresent with just you know general\ninformation about the mental health\ndisorder so schizophrenia as a\npsychiatric disorder that's\ncharacterized by a number of symptoms\nand the presentation of schizophrenia\nchanges and is unique to every person so\nyou might have symptoms from\ndifferent categories from positive to\nnegative symptoms you might have\ncognitive impairments as well\ndisorganization in your thought\nprocesses it depends on each individual\nperson how they're going to present but\nfor example hallucinations are something\nthat we hear very often that is\nassociated with schizophrenia one of the\nthings people don't know is that you can\nhave a hallucinations\nin many different ways so\nwe we experience our world through our\nsenses through sight through hearing\ntaste touch smell and our brain\ntranslates the signals that we get from\nour environment\nand it makes us see reality in\na general sense so you everyone will see\nthat a table might be green or might be\nBrown\nbut the reality is when you have a\nhallucination your brain is picking up a\nsignal that doesn't exist so it's\ntricked in some way to thinking that\nthere might be something else so some\npeople have visual hallucinations where\nthey might see certain things they might\nsee people they might see light they\nmight hear sounds or voices\nin some very advanced cases you might\nsee a person who is actually feeling\nthat there's something crawling under\ntheir skin this is a very rare\npresentation but it happens and then you\ncan have also delusions in that same\npositive symptom family which is some\nindividuals might think that they have\nsuperpowers that they can fly or that\nthey they might think that they're God\nor some kind of delusion of grandeur you\nmight have other elements like you might\nfeel that you're being watched observed\nso more paranoid delusions you might\nthink that maybe the government is\nlooking for you and trying to kill you\nand these are very significant\nespecially in terms of paranoia because\nthat makes you distrustful\nof government agencies of health care\nworkers and that might really impede\nwith a person seeking help but then you\nhave negative symptoms you might have an\ninability to feel pleasure or an\ninability to be motivated to act or to\nto go outside you might feel like you're\nnot having any emotions like you're\napathetic to the world\nyou might also have and this is very\nthis happens very commonly where you\nhave some cognitive impairment so you\nmight feel like\nyour processing speed is slower so if\nyou try to do let's say a mathematical\nequation in your head instead of taking\na few seconds it could take a minute if\nyou're trying to concentrate you might\nnot be able to do it so these are very\ncommon symptoms of schizophrenia and the\npresentation the intensity it varies by\nperson it's a very unique\npresentation because every person reacts\ndifferently every person experiences\nschizophrenia differently\noh that was a really good description\num I liked how you mentioned really\nwhat's in the DSM so like the positive\nnegative symptoms one thing that I also\njust wanted to add because when I was\nlearning\num like Psychiatry a lot of people were\nconfused by the terms positive and\nnegative symptoms like positive meaning\ngood negative meaning bad but that's not\nthe case I think it's just really\nimportant to bring it out here for\npeople who are might not be aware\npositive being that it's something\nadditional that you would not typically\nhave in your normal experiences so like\nlike you said like hearing voices\nhallucinations\num delusions things like that and then\nnegative being that something less than\nwhat you typically would have so it's\nlike social withdrawal or like\ndisorganized thinking because the\nBaseline I would say would be like\nyou're able to think and you're you're\nable to kind of like assess the world in\na functional way I don't know if that\nmakes sense for people who are watching\nlet me know but yeah that's one thing I\nalso just wanted to share in terms of\nwhat I found was a common misconception\num and I also had a follow-up question\nfor you so you mentioned a lot of these\nsymptoms and they clearly could be very\ndistressing for someone so what is the\npresentation like in terms of\num the development of schizophrenia will\npeople kind of expect going from\nyou know nothing to like full-blown in a\nshort amount of time or is it kind of\nsomething that you know there's a long\nprodromal phase\num what's the kind of thing that you see\nin your practice\nso it really depends on the person and\nwhat initiates the the the schizophrenia\nso generally we we see schizophrenia on\nset\num by a psycho a first episode psychotic\npsychosis rather so it's basically you\nhave your first psychosis\nand then you get diagnosed with varying\ndiagnosis it could be schizophrenia but\nit could be other like a psychotic\ndepression could be a differential for\nfor a first episode psychosis the idea\nis when when you talk about\nhow it starts there are many different\nPathways\num in general let's assume that\nindividuals who develop schizophrenia\nhave a predisposition for it and then\nyou might have a trigger a stressful\ntraumatic event might be a trigger\num the use of recreational drugs might\nalso or alcohol could in certain cases\ntrigger the onset of psychosis you\nyou'll see different presentations we\nknow for example there's a genetic\nfactor in schizophrenia so individuals\nlet's say their both parents have\nschizophrenia they're much more likely\nto develop it as well so then you would\nexpect you could expect\nthat earlier on in in their lives they\nmight have a psychotic episode so it it\nvery much depends on what's going on\nwhat's going on around this situation\nit's not always the same trigger for\neveryone and also\nit might be very fast\nwhereas you might have a\nlet's say a\na degradation of your well-being so you\nmight start with very mild symptoms and\nas you progress and have multiple\npsychotic episodes\nyou might become resistant to medication\nyou might have an increase in the\nintensity of the symptoms so some people\nstart off very strong\nand a lot of people start off milder and\nthen it develops over time so there is\nno to my knowledge there is not a\nspecific single Pathway to the onset and\nthen\nthe the evolution but what we know is\nthat it's a lifetime disorder there is\nno cure for schizophrenia and the\nresponse to treatment varies so some\npeople will be extremely responsive and\nthey'll have a management of their\nsymptoms that is incredible and some\npeople might be resistant to medication\nsome people might not actually have\num the the the best outcome from just a\nmedical treatment or a pharmaceutical\ntreatment\nso from what I hear there's just so much\nvariability there's no kind of one size\nfits all and because it's such a\ndistressing disorder I think it really\nwarrants the help from a professional or\nthat someone could really benefit if\nthey go reach out to someone like\nyourself like a social worker or a\npsychologist or a psychiatrist I\nacknowledge that there's so many\nbarriers\num to reaching out for help because a\nlot of people are scared they don't know\nwhat to expect so\num perhaps I wonder if you would be able\nto speak about what someone could expect\nwhen they reach out to you like a social\nworker with potentially a diagnosis of\nschizophrenia\nso the challenge in in the question is\nactually it depends on where you are so\nobviously if you're in a in a state or a\nprovince or a country that has services\nthat are that are adapted you might get\nmore out of seeing a healthcare\nprofessional or a social worker in other\nsituations it might be very difficult\nbecause it's a private system you have\nto pay out of pocket but I'll try to be\nas general as possible so to answer this\nI think it's important to understand\nwhat is the impact of\nschizophrenia on functioning so we say\nthat there is a very a very strong\npotential for having psychosocial\ndysfunction so being unable to function\nin\nyour social spheres or in society in\ngeneral\num\nso for example some individuals will\nhave trouble finding a job or holding a\njob for many reasons either\nthey can't concentrate or sometimes\nyou hear voices and then you you talk\nback some people will talk back and\nit doesn't it's not everyone that I\nthink is in a is in an adapted workplace\nwhere people don't judge or people don't\nlook at them and say oh maybe that\nperson's weird why is she talking to\nherself these are you know parts of\ndiscrimination parts of stigma that\naffect uh individuals with schizophrenia\nand still today like you see it\neverywhere so you might go see a social\nworker and they will help you look for\nadapted workplaces so there are in\ndifferent states in different places\nworkplaces that accommodate individuals\nwith mental health disorders so it could\nbe shorter days to help with the\nconcentration it could be an adapted\nenvironment so or people who who are\ntrained who know about this specific\ndisorder and then they can help out or\nthey can just not be judgmental not be\ndiscriminatory so these programs are\nbecoming much more popular\num because\nin general and historically individuals\nwith schizophrenia were less likely to\nhave full-time employment were less\nlikely to be able to finish University\nor to finish training programs so adding\nthis adapted format really helped bring\na lot of patients into a more inclusive\nSociety got them out of welfare got them\ninto training programs got them into\nmore fulfilling careers now obviously\nit's not everyone and it's only a start\nI think but social workers can put you\nin contact with these various companies\nthat do offer adapted workplaces you\ncould have\nyou could have really\nwe we see a lot of suffering\nschizophrenia is a disorder that causes\na lot of suffering for individuals their\nfamilies their friends their Social\nCircles\nand unfortunately sometimes it leads to\nsuicidal ideations uh suicidal attempts\nand one of the things that social\nworkers do a lot is\num crisis intervention so very often\nyou'll see in psychiatric emergencies a\nlot of social workers you'll see them in\nthe community as well that are going or\nsome that do Outreach just to to help\nindividuals who have these ideations not\nto go through with it to find hope to\nfind reasons to continue on to find\nmotivation to to get treatment to to\nwork on this aspect that is on the\nsuffering so part of it is getting help\nin a crisis but also social workers at\nleast where I live\nare also participating in in programs\npartnering up with police so we know\nthat in a very decompensated state in a\nstate of psychosis some people might\npresent as very dangerous and there have\nbeen Unfortunate Events where the police\nhave had to\nto fire upon these individuals so in\nthat situation if you add a social\nworker if you have I had the\npsychosocial intervention there is less\nlikelihood of having a violent outcome\nand there is less likelihood that\nsomeone who is\nmost likely less trained with\npsychosocial interventions that don't\nmake a mistake so this is kind of a\nprotective element for for our for our\npatients is having someone who\nunderstands the their reality and who\ncan help them in those very uh difficult\ncrises so it's very important to have a\nsocial social worker present\nI mean there are other mental health\ncare workers that can help as well it's\nnot reserved only to Social Work\nand maybe one of the the key points is\nsocial workers can do counseling can\nhelp you adapt to your reality very\noften we we forget that schizophrenia is\na relatively\nearly onset so mid teens to late 20s is\nThe Hot Zone of where you're most likely\nto have a psychotic episode to develop\nschizophrenia and I think it's very\nimportant to know that at any point that\nyou that you have a break in your\ndevelopment in in your process of\ndiscovering who you are discovering what\nyou like what what would you like to do\nas a job in the future what would you\nlike to go to university like what would\nyou like to do in general\num or making friends having romantic\nrelationships you know all of these\nelements\nthe you grow through your adolescence or\npuberty through your young adulthood you\nkind of develop who you are you develop\nyour personality you develop all these\nthese relationships and when you have to\nbe hospitalized because you've had a\npsychotic disorder you've had you you\nwere diagnosed with uh schizophrenia\nyou're losing out on a portion of that\ndevelopment process it's delayed because\nyou're in the hospital you're not\nbuilding friendships you're not going\nout with uh with friends or with your\npartner you're not going to class you're\nnot finishing your high school degree\nyou're not finishing your University\ndegree you're not working\nand you see all your friends all the\npeople around you advance in life and\nyou're stuck at the same position\nso it's a really big challenge it's it's\nvery distressful it's very depressing to\nto see that maybe you have to repeat a\nyear in high school because you missed\ntoo many classes or that you might not\nbe able to finish your University degree\nbecause it's not adapted enough for your\nneeds and you can't concentrate anymore\nand you have problems with focusing so\noverall\na social worker can help you\ngo through that difficult period\nbut they can also help you adapt through\nthat difficult period so are there tools\nthat you can learn are there strategies\nthat you can learn to minimize the\nimpact of of your disorder\nare there ways that you can go around it\nare there ways of achieving your goals\nthat are maybe a bit more alternative\nbut get you to your objective and\nthis is what we try to do we try to help\npeople adapt to their reality and reach\nwhatever objective whatever goal they\nhave to get as close as possible to that\nand it's a significant partnership we\nwe need people to to work very hard and\nwe try to work just as hard to get them\nto that point\nI mean in terms of what an individual\nmight have as services in terms of\ncounseling some social workers can do\nPsychotherapy can do cognitive\nbehavioral therapy can do very adapted\ntherapies as well it depends on your\ntraining and on your license then you\ncan have\nalso more generalized support and\nanother thing that's very important that\ngets gets emitted very often is\nsocial workers are very good at getting\nnew services and getting you benefits if\nthose benefits exist so in my in my\ncareer I've been filling out welfare\nforms\nI I think hundreds if not thousands of\ntimes because\nthe first thing is if you're not working\nif you're not in school if you have an\napartment you need to live you need to\nbe able to afford that you need to be\nable to have food to do your groceries\nand if you're if your government\nprovides benefits such as welfare\ndisability\nwe're going to figure out how to get the\nmaximum for you\nthat's part of the recovery process is\nmaking sure that your basic needs are\nmet so that includes having enough money\nto support yourself\nobviously it's not fortunes you're not\nyou're not gonna be rich out of\ngovernment disability\nbenefits it's it's it's much less than\nanyone should ever survive upon but\ncompared to sleeping and you know being\nhomeless and having to sleep on the\nstreet or not having enough food to fill\nyour stomach there are elements that\nsocial workers can do that are extremely\nimportant and they're very bureaucratic\nthey're very paperwork focused but they\nget you services and they get you\nbenefits so that's super important to\ntalk about as well\nso yeah it's really interesting to hear\nabout the diverse kind of services that\na social worker could could provide so\njust kind of summarizing what you said\nto those who just joined\num going from trying to find adaptive\nworkplaces to intervening during crisis\ninterventions to working with the police\nand also for those who have license to\ndo so to also provide therapy so in that\nway it's really kind of a multi-level\napproach to helping and supporting a\nperson towards recovery whether that be\nimproving the relationship that they\nhave with themselves through therapy\num improving the relationship they have\nwith other people maybe through working\nwith the police\num perhaps also their relationship with\nSociety if they're working by finding\nthem resources to engage in workplaces\nthat support them as a human being so\nit's really nice to see how social\nworkers help in all those different kind\nof areas I also want do you do you have\nany specific resources let's say\ncanada-wide that someone who might be\nstruggling but who hasn't yet reached\nout might like to look after the Stream\nso it it really depends I think\num\nthere's no one specific resource that is\nuh that is as adapted I could say hey go\nhere and they'll figure you out I think\nthe first step let's say Canada wide is\nand the most important step is going to\nyour local community uh Health Clinic\ngoing to if you can have access to a\nprimary care physician if you have\naccess to any kind of mental health\nsupport\nbecause the first step actually to be\nfair if you have schizophrenia you\nprobably have already been in contact\nwith some form of healthcare\npractitioner uh most likely a\npsychiatrist that gives the diagnosis\nbut I think it's important not\nnecessarily where you go but that you go\nsomewhere so I'll give it in in a more\nof a general sense so shelters\nif you're in if you don't have anywhere\nto sleep go to a shelter go to a shelter\nbecause no one should sleep in the\nstreet if you don't have enough food go\nto a food bank if they exist in your\narea it it doesn't matter which as long\nas you get something from there if you\nneed if you need support\nworst case go to an emergency department\nasked us to be referred to a\npsychiatrist asked to be referred to a\nsocial worker or anyone that works in\nthe public sector that you can have\naccess to because the first step when\nyou need help is just reaching out to\nsomeone\nyou can look there are a lot of like the\nCanadian the Mental Health Association\nhas a lot of information you have\ncommunity community organizations that\nare great and they vary upon location\num but it all depends on what your\nspecific need is if you're not doing\nwell and this is the most important\nthing if you're not feeling well if you\nfeel like you want to end it if you're\nyou're in such a this position of\ndistress that you're thinking about\nsuicide call 9-1-1\ngo to the emergency don't let anyone\nmake you feel like what you're\nexperiencing is is not\nbig enough or a crisis\nstay there call 9-1-1 if you need\nmultiple times but say\nState what is going on someone will help\nyou the idea is\nthere is always somewhere to go and I\nthink it's more important to reach out\nand even to reach out to family you can\ntrust people you can confide in to to to\nfriends that you can confide in if\nyou're not ready to go to a social\nworker or a psychologist or a\npsychiatrist or any kind of healthcare\nprofessional\ntry as much as you can to confide in\nsomeone that you trust and ask them if\nthey can help you in making the first\nstep\nbecause resources in general they vary\nby by you know by area by country by\nfunding but the important thing is just\nreaching out someone I think that's the\nfirst step more than giving out names\nit's go anywhere where there's a trained\nprofessional\nand they might be able to refer you to\nthe person that finally helps you out\ngets you out of where you are so I think\nthat's probably the most important\naspect is just reaching out\nthank you for sharing that I think it's\nreally important I'd like to Echo that\nas well because I think a lot of times a\nlot of people just don't really know\nwhere to begin\num they have some sort of distress\nsometimes they can't even put a finger\non what is going on they just know that\nsomething's wrong and if possible it's\ngood to reach out to someone like you\nsaid a GP and they'll be able to direct\nyou to other services at least in Canada\nand in the UK you would have to go to\nsee your GP and then they would do a\nreferral to other services like\nPsychiatry or any other relevant\num clinicians so yeah that's definitely\na good start\num so with that unless there are any\nother questions I just wanted to thank\neveryone for joining this stream where\nwe really chatted about schizophrenia in\ngeneral and then really took a social\ntake on schizophrenia so that people are\njust more aware about what it is and\nwhat they could do to reach out for help\num I'm always fully fully behind\nsupporting people who are looking for\nways to seek help from themselves so\num if you would like to share your\nexperiences this goes out to everyone\nwho's watching\num or if you are a clinician who would\nlike to share your experiences you can\nreach out to me\num email is Monica psych2go.net and\nuntil then I just wanted to thank you\nfor your time to those watching and\nthank you so much Alex for being part of\nthis\nthank you so much for having me thank\nyou so bye everyone thanks for coming"
