    "transcript": "we humans have made the finding a\npartner ritual so complicated that even\nexperts are still finding new tips\ntricks and hints this dance can often\nfeel unnatural to us making initial\nforays or revisit after long breaks\nunnerving we even have a name for the\ndance\neating it's a jungle out there and we'd\nlike to give you some tips to help you\nnavigate the new terrain or help you\nreacquaint yourself expansion pack\nincluded\nnumber one know yourself before you even\ncontemplate who the other person is you\ndefinitely need to know you this will\nsave you an incredible amount of\nfrustration and time if you already know\nthe fundamental basics of what you need\nin terms of values treatment beliefs\nideas and support\nthink of it as the absolute Essentials\nthe deal breakers if you will for\nexample you can probably live with a\nperson who likes a different brand of\nchocolate than you but you might never\nbe able to stay with someone who refuses\nto comfort you when you're crying\nspending some time exploring which\nbehaviors you value can help you develop\nreasonable and tangible expectations\nwhen you understand this you can\nconfidently allow yourself to cross off\nthe list those who don't meet your needs\nnumber two\ngo at your own pace yay who's in the\nwhole dating thing again that's right\nit's you you're a part of this and so\nyou have every right to decide how you\nare going to go about it I'm sure other\npeople may try to nudge you in\nparticular directions but you are the\nonly one who 100 knows what's going on\ninside and can tailor your speed to it\nin fact being rushed could be considered\na red flag if someone keeps pushing\nrushing and insisting despite you\nindicating otherwise this is a sign that\nthe other person can't take no for an\nanswer which in turn implies just how\nlittle your needs matter to them\nnumber three think of each step as\npractice\ndo you expect to hit a hole in one the\nfirst time you play golf well dating is\nkind of similar it takes practice these\ndays online meeting through texts apps\nand even online forums is far more\ncommon no one you know has vetted these\npeople and if you are used to meeting\npeople in the traditional way this can\nbe daunting certain behaviors show up\nmore often than others for example if\nyou're heteronormative a woman will have\nto deal with many messages from men with\na blunt aggressively sexual approach\nwhile the men deal with ghosting from\nthe ladies interestingly enough if\nyou're pursuing a same-sex relationship\nthere is a tendency for Less pressure on\nwho sends a message first and a lot\nfewer in your face inappropriate replies\nnumber four communicate and be honest as\nnerve-wracking as it might be dating is\nsupposed to be a good thing a fun thing\nand there are a few things less fun than\nsevere discomfort from Awkward silences\nor cringy outbursts\nquite often many of these painful dates\nstem from one or both parties not being\nhonest or communicative about their\nintentions actual wants needs and\nboundaries\ncertainly first impressions are\nimportant we're not telling you to go on\na first date in your binge watching PJs\nafter not having brushed your hair think\nof it more like if you're not actually a\nhot shot because jillionaire don't act\nlike you can make it rain the truth will\nout eventually and that leads to\nseriously awkward sometimes super\nembarrassing confrontations oh and\nwasted time so much wasted time you do\nwant to tell just enough so both of you\nunderstand each other spilling\neverything with all details in history\nand a torrential flood especially early\non is overwhelming while it may not be\nadvisable to gush marriage on a first\ndate it's a good idea to be forthcoming\nabout why you are dating whether it's a\nhookup a long-term thing or even just I\nhaven't met anyone you in a while in the\nsame vein don't go on and on about past\npartners but being honest about the big\nstuff like being widowed or divorced Etc\nwill help steer interactions in the\nright direction giving some general but\nhonest info will help avoid red flag\nstatus too it's about balance if you're\nreturning to the dating scene after\nbeing away for a super long time and\ngive no reason that seems suspicious on\nthe flip side if you spill every single\nmoment of your past like you're trying\nto find Absolution through therapy this\nis also not good okay number five watch\nout for red flags and speaking of those\nred flags look out for the four major\nones criticism defensiveness a\nstonewalling and contempt\nbut what exactly am I looking for you\nask don't worry we got you covered\ncriticism isn't a one-off you're late\nit's an all or nothing thing with the\ncriticism flag so more like you're\nalways late or you never notice me so\nthe movies were right on this one only a\nSith deals in absolutes defensiveness is\nlike a pre-attack everything you say\nbecomes the opening Salvo for a debate\nfight or guilt trip an offhand comment\nof it's raining pretty hard why'd you\npark so far away gets a response of I\ndon't want my car to get scratched do\nyou know how much that costs it's just\nrain what's your problem or asking for\nfun do you think a hot dog is a sandwich\nand do you get a full-blown insulting\ntirade about giving inane reasoning to\nmanipulate a result I mean come on\nsometimes the question's just a question\nstonewalling on the other hand takes an\ninactive approach just like it sounds\nyou say a thing or trying to talk after\na conflict and the other person doesn't\nrespond or they go offline you explain\nyour stance and they either act like\nthey don't care or they simply act like\nyou didn't say anything at all contempt\nthe most Sinister of the Four Horsemen\nof the apoca I mean of dating contempt\ngoes hand in hand with being\ncondescending they'll behave in a\nmean-spirited manner humiliating you or\notherwise making sure you know their\nSuperior in some way so demeaning jokes\nat your expense on a first date\nrun away in fact if any of these red\nflags make themselves clearly absolutely\nknown the best course of action is to\nturn and leave and not after giving it a\ngo for a year leave quickly you'll have\nnoticed that they all entail the flag\nbearer not caring about their partner or\nat worst using their partner as a tool\nunlike a sport though dating also has a\nyellow flag where there's unease but\nyou're not really sure if it's really a\nthing when in doubt ask an expert you\ncould also sit back and ask yourself how\nyou'd feel if this treatment was being\nreceived by someone close to you when\nput in that light we tend to lose the\nrosy glasses of initial dating\nforgiveness\nnumber six tell someone you know where\nyou are and be aware of your\nsurroundings\nI know you've been watching those\ndocu-series or at least have seen the\nnews feeds you know the ones where the\naftermath involves a friend or family\nmember of the victim saying we had no\nidea where they were if only always let\nsomeone you trust know where you are and\nwith who you never know when something\nmay happen it might be something Petty\nlike this is super awkward can you\nconveniently show up or call so I can\nleave this date\nor on the other hand it could possibly\nsave your life as much as we're all\ndigitally connected always remember that\nsomeone you met online or while waiting\nfor coffee is not someone you know\ndating is complex we want to arm you\nwith your best chance so stay tuned for\npart two and take that stride and pride\nwe're here for you"
