    "transcript": "have you heard of the concept of inner\nchild the inner child's concept was\ncreated by Carl Jung a Swiss\npsychiatrist who described your inner\nchild as a part of your subconscious\nthat recalls all of your past\nexperiences and what you felt when that\nevent happened the good and the\ntraumatizing when your inner child is\nwounded the negative emotions they cause\nyou to feel can seep into present day\nand impact your daily activities and\nrelationships a great example is\nRapunzel having a narcissistic parent\nlike Mother Gothel taught Rapunzel and\nher inner child that she is an\nintelligent she can't do anything\nwithout her mother and she can't do\nanything right had Rapunzel not escaped\nthe tower and experienced the world her\nway she would have grown to be a woman\nwith that wounded inner child who still\nbelieved those awful things about\nherself and stayed locked in that Tower\nthis is exactly what can happen when\nyour wounded inner child isn't cared for\nhave you been noticing your mental\nhealth dragging lately this could be\nyour inner child trying to tell you that\nthey're wounded and it's time to let\nsome of the crap go so let's talk about\nfive ways you can begin to care for your\nwounded inner child be sure to watch\nuntil the end for a little disclaimer on\nthis topic number one re-parenting when\nthere's a child there's typically\nsomeone in a parenting role to teach and\nnurture them in her YouTube video how to\nheal the inner child Dr Nicole lepera\nexplains how learning to be that strong\nwise parent you wish you had can help\ncare for your wounded inner child let's\nsay You're really anxious about a\nmedical procedure coming up and you\ncan't seem to think about anything else\nyou feel the anxiety and fear consuming\nyou but what do you do you can practice\nre-parenting your wounded inner child\nhow well imagine a younger version of\nyou standing in front of you and say\nwhat you would have wanted to hear from\nyour caregiver maybe it goes like hey\nkiddo I know you're pretty scared about\nyour procedure today it's absolutely\nvalid to be afraid since you're not sure\nwhat to expect but you have to be brave\nthis will help you to be healthy and\nlive a long life but holistic\npsychologist suggests acknowledging the\nemotion being felt rather than\ndismissing or criticizing it\nat first it might seem weird but with\npractice parenting your inner child will\nbecome easier and the wound May begin to\nheal too\nnumber two earning trust when your inner\nchild is wounded chances are it's\nbecause you've been taught bad lessons\nor told lies throughout your actual\nchildhood as Carl Jung details in his\nbook healing the inner child the inner\nchild is a piece of our conscious mind\nwhether it's to look both ways before\ncrossing the road or not speak when Dad\nis in the room our conscious mind uses\nthese lessons to help us shape our\noutlooks as adults think back to our\nfriend Miss Rapunzel and Mother Gothel\nmother of the year over here basically\ntold her kid she needs to be locked up\nfor life to be safe because she's so\nweak stupid and gullible after all of\nthe negativity Rapunzel's inner child\nbelieved that she was better off locked\naway in reality Rapunzel knows her way\naround a frying pan and can take care of\nherself\nwhen you approach the inner child as\nthat wise inner parent you need to show\nthem it's okay to trust you by providing\nhealthy advice for Rapunzel that might\nsound like you are smart strong and\nbrave you have plenty to share with this\nworld it sounds a lot better than being\nlocked away in a tower am I right number\nthree explore the past\nif your inner child is wounded enough to\nbe giving you some mental grief you can\nassume that they've been through a lot\nof trauma in the past in the book\nrecovery of your inner child by Lucia\ncappuccioni they suggest calling on your\ninner child to help uncover all types of\nmemories and even some to help explain\nyour trauma or triggers one method\ncappuccioni suggests is calling on your\ninner child grab a piece of paper and\nsomething to write with they can even be\na crayon and put it in your non-dominant\nhand and draw a time your inner child\nwas truly happy or truly upset this can\nbe a full-blown picture or symbols that\nremind you of that time and why you may\nhave held on to certain emotions another\noption can be writing a letter of\nforgiveness to your parent caregiver for\nany trauma you experienced this can help\nrecover lost memories or create closure\nin a situation or there may not be any\nthis step is best done with a mental\nhealth professional to help navigate\nthis exercise safely and to help unpack\nanything that comes up number for\nconfront childhood trauma lies sometimes\ntrauma can come from things you were\ntold from your caregiver these can be\nlies about you your thoughts and\nopinions or even your actions they may\nnot necessarily be true but you were\ntaught that they are fact licensed\nclinical social worker and YouTuber\nPatrick Tian breaks down some of these\nlines in his video six lies from\nchildhood trauma 2022. some examples are\nthe real you wasn't acceptable or people\ndon't want to get to know you in\nadulthood these lies can cause you to be\na people pleaser and to downplay your\nlikes and opinions or feel ashamed of\nyourself anyone remember the movie Black\nSwan you have a 20-something young adult\nNina living with mom in New York City\nwith those rent prices okay I get it but\nmother keeps telling her that she's\nbasically incapable of doing anything\nwithout her not cool and not true when\nthese lies come up Patrick tells us it's\nbest to identify the source of the words\nis this something you say and believe or\nis this something you've been\nconditioned to believe from a caregiver\nand number five be mindful it can be\nreally easy to get wrapped up in Old\nHabits especially when you're trying to\ncreate new ones believe me say you have\na parent with very narcissistic\nTendencies it may be a daily uphill\nbattle to not act like them when in a\nparenting or authoritative role however\nit may be a bit easier when they're\nbeing mindful of their actions thoughts\nand words\nVietnamese zen master and author\nexplains that the first function of\nmindfulness is for us to open our\nawareness enough to recognize those\nunhealthy thoughts words actions and\npatterns through this way of thinking\nyou can also become aware of your inner\nchild and what they need to continue\nhealing how do you do this just think\nbefore you speak and act when you make a\npoint to ask yourself if this is a\nhealthy act it becomes easier to\nidentify and stop unhealthy behaviors\nthis one is kind of tricky because it\ncan be really discouraging when you\nrealize you're falling into the same\npatterns but be patient and kind with\nyourself it's just like any other skill\nyou have to work at it to be good at it\nand it's okay to ask for help along the\nway from loved ones a trusted teacher or\na mental health professional\nunfortunately it's true what they say\nhistory does repeat itself and a wounded\ninner child can be the root cause of\nthis cycle it's time to break it the to\nsomething that may never be totally\ncured but it will help to heal both your\ntrauma and your wounded inner child how\nelse can you care for a wounded inner\nchild to promote healing let us know\ndown below as always keep an eye on site\nfor more psychical content until
