new things now\ncompare that to who you are now are you\nstill quite similar to how you were or\nhave you changed a lot there's never\njust one thing that causes you to become\nthe person you are there are\ncombinations of different factors acting\ntogether to influence you to become the\nperson that you are today so if you're\nwondering what happened to the shy or\noutgoing kid you used to be let's take a\nlook at how your upbringing shapes your\npersonality Aces\nthe things you go through as a child can\nplay a big part in who you become when\nyou're older aces are adverse childhood\nexperiences and it refers to any\ntraumatic event you went through when\nyou were a child this can mean being in\nan environment that was violent unsafe\nand unstable such as experiencing or\nwitnessing physical or emotional abuse\nor neglect these traumatic experiences\ncan have a lasting impact on your health\naccording to the CDC Kaiser Ace study\nthe more Aces you experience the more\nyou're at risk for negative Health\noutcomes these include chronic Health\ndiseases such as heart disease stroke\nand diabetes health risk behaviors such\nas alcoholism and smoking as well as\nmental health issues such as depression\none study by grunznick and others from\n2019 even found that it led to higher\nlevels of neuroticism which has been\nassociated with mood disorders and\ngenerally poorer Health traumatic events\nin childhood can affect your health in\nthe long term and influence the person\nyou become becoming depressed or turning\nto smoking or alcohol to cope with what\nhappened may be a habit that sticks with\nyou through adulthood so if this is\nsomething that you're struggling with\nremember that with help and support you\ncan overcome the challenges that you\nfaced in childhood and alleviate the\nrisks and effects that it has on you\nfamily structure\nanother factor in your upbringing that\nmay have influenced the person you've\nbecome is the family structure you grew\nup with\ncertain types of households are more at\nrisk and vulnerable to life shocks and\nunexpected challenges according to\ngingerbread and step change a UK debt\ncharity single parent households are\nmore likely to face debt problems due to\nnot having enough income Financial\nchallenges from divorce and economic\nabuse by a partner these struggles not\nonly lead to physical and mental\nexhaustion for many parents but also\nmental health issues such as anxiety and\ndepression this in turn affects the\nstability and support they provide for\nthe children involved as a kid you don't\nunderstand why your parents are always\naway for work why there's not always\nfood on the table or where they might\nlash out when frustrated these\nuncertainties at home can affect your\nphysical and mental health a study\nlooking at the effects of family\nstructure on children's mental health\neven found that those from single and\ndivorced families are more likely to\nreceive an ADHD diagnosis what's more it\ncan also lead to behavioral issues when\nyou turn to harmful activities or make\nReckless decisions as a way to cope\naccording to a study in the journal\neducation next children living in a\nsingle apparent household are less\nlikely to finish school of course not\nall single-parent households are\nunstable but they are more vulnerable to\nsudden changes and disruptions so if you\ngrew up in an unstable household where\nyou rarely have the support you needed\nit may have had a lasting effect on your\nemotional and mental well-being\nsocial learning theory when talking\nabout our childhood we must mention the\nimportance of the people who took care\nof us after all much of our personality\ncomes from the people we grew up around\nthis is often due to a combination of\ngenetics and the social learning theory\nwhich explains how behavior is learned\nthrough observation and imitation first\nstudied by Alfred bandura in his Bobo\nDoll Experiment he showed how children\noften copy the behavior of the adults\naround them when they saw an adult punch\nand kick the toy model they displayed\nthe same aggressive behavior toward the\ntoy when left alone with it what they\nlearned is that children will look to\nthe adults around them to learn how to\nact and behave in uncertain situations\nthese behaviors if continually rewarded\nbecome reinforced and turn into a habit\nin this way if you grew up seeing your\nparents lash out be aggressive or even\nviolent towards others it's likely\nyou'll develop the same behaviors as\nthem and treat others as such of course\nthe opposite is also true where parents\nwho emphasize kindness and patience will\noften have children who will are the\nsame behaviors so have a think about the\npeople you were surrounded by how did\nthey act the theory of mind\nas a child your thoughts feelings and\nbeliefs lie at the center of everything\nonly when you start to interact with\nother people will you realize that they\nhave their own thoughts and beliefs that\nare different from your own this is\nessentially the theory of mind this\nsocial cognitive skill refers to the\nability to figure out what others might\nthink feel and believe and distinguish\nit from your own while you may not be\naware of it this skill is essential to\nour social interactions and\nconversations\nit usually develops in early childhood\nand improves with age as you gain more\nsocial experience without a strong\ntheory of mind you may find yourself\nalways frustrated that others don't see\nthings as you do or have issues with\nunderstanding what other people think\nand want this is one reason Playmates\nand friends are so important to your\nSocial Development during childhood\nit's the first time you get to interact\nwith people similar to you and learn how\nto communicate empathize and see things\nfrom another's point of view this skill\nis what allows you to tell when your\nfriend is upset even when they haven't\nsaid a word or know what they want\ndespite what they've said\nhow different would you say you've\nbecome have any of these factors\ninfluenced
