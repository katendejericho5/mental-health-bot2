might not be\nhappening anymore we're seeing more\npeople having confrontations and\ndramatic outbursts on social media in\nforums groups or communities and\nannouncing that they're leaving these\nonline spaces in an exaggerated way for\nattention according to Urban Dictionary\nflouncing is leaving an internet group\nor thread with exaggerated drama and\nacting in ways to draw attention to the\ndrama in other words it's the internet\nequivalent of storming out of the room\nand making a dramatic exit while\nslamming the door behind you on the way\nout in real life conflicts one might\nfeel sorry for the person who's\ndramatically storming out of the\nsituation because they've been wounded\nand hurt some people might even run\nafter the aggrieved person and say no\ndon't leave step a in the world of the\ninternet it isn't always possible to run\nafter the party that's hurt which makes\nthe dramatic exit an ineffectual\nbehavior when people throw a big enough\ntantrum and cause a scene especially if\nthey aren't well known to the other\ngroup members people's reactions online\nare more likely to be bye don't let the\ndoor hit you on the way out it turns out\nthere's lots of psychological and\nneuroscientific evidence to back up this\nBehavior dramatic people want others to\nnotice how upset or sad or angry or\nanxious and frustrated they are in order\nto come to their rescue and there are\ntwo types of people in this world those\nwho avoid confrontation and those who\nthrive on stirring the pot according to\nscience alert psychologists have come up\nwith a scientific measurement scale\ncalled the need for drama researchers\nhave found that those who scored higher\non this scale shared three main\ncharacteristics manipulation\noutspokenness AKA gossip and reactivity\ndue to their internal perception of\nbeing a victim scientists also found\nthat dramatic people tend to be more\nand therefore are more likely to jump\ninto drama and tantrum mode but how does\nthis affect us Nicole Roberts from\nForbes tells us that according to\nNeuroscience drama is another way of\nsaying that someone lacks social and\nemotional skills where there's a\ndisconnect between the two as socially\nwired human beings we love storytelling\nit helps Bond us together but in today's\nfast-paced world we have limited time\nand shorter attention spans so we're\nbecoming less patient the way we\ncommunicate today through storytelling\nhas changed this has included some\npositive changes such as the increase in\nTed Talk videos and videos like ours\nit's like to go but on the flip side our\nsocial interactions on digital platforms\nare filled with misinformation and\ngossip as a social species we all\nrequire attention but social media has\ncaused an excess in attention-seeking\nbehaviors it's 24 7 all pervasive\navailability and psychologists believe\nthat this behavior is driven by\nemotional aspiration When people's\nbeliefs values or ideals are threatened\ninstead of just removing themselves from\nthe situation or quietly leaving they\ninstead become impulsive in their\nreactions and their expectations of the\noutcome when we don't get the attention\nwe seek we feel anxious and to ease that\nanxiety we instinctively seek more drama\nto get the attention we're craving but\nthere's a downside to this drama\nstress and we all know that's harmful to\nour health according to psychology today\nbecause conflicts cause stress which is\nour defense mechanism against perceived\nharm it tells us one of two things we\nhave either been hurt or were about to\nbe if we think we're hurt our brain\nswitches into action and causes us to be\nmore impulsive or reactive we may not\nhave control over our environment but we\ndo have control over how we react to it\nso the next time you feel like the\ninternet is against you instead of\nangrily announcing I'm leaving to a\nbunch of
