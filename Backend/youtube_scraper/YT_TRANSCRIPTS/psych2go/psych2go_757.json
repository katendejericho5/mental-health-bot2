    "transcript": "those of us who are Romantics at heart\noften fantasized about that perfect if\nwe were a movie Love\neven if you're not a romantic you might\nstill want a special someone by your\nside to lean on laugh with cry to and\ncuddle the heck out of at the end of a\nbad day remember Jim and Pam from The\nOffice despite all their ups and downs\nthey still had A Beautiful Romance they\ntrusted each other supported each\nother's dreams and were lovers and best\nfriends at the same time\nsickening but like I want that too\nsometimes real life relationships aren't\nvery Jim and Pam sometimes they look\nmore like a mild version of Ryan and\nKelly a little dysfunctional and pretty\ntoxic\ntoxic behaviors can creep in on your\nrelationship whether you mean to or not\nwhat are some of those common behaviors\nthat can kill a relationship keep\nwatching to find out number one I'm\nsorry\nsometimes Partners can unintentionally\nhurt each other maybe a joke goes too\nfar or their cooking gets criticized a\nlittle bit too much when our partner is\ngenuinely hurt this should be a sign to\napologize avoiding that apology or never\ngiving one is one common behavior that\ncan kill a relationship\nsometimes it can be a bit difficult to\nsay sorry on the outside it may seem\nwe're too proud to apologize\nbeneath the surface we may feel afraid\nto admit we made a mistake it can be\nscary to feel like we're inadequate or\nguilty no matter how hard it may be to\nutter that small but meaningful sorry it\ncan actually save your relationship in\nthe long run a 2017 study published in\nFrontiers in Psychology found that if\nyou offer a sincere apology the other\nperson is much more likely to forgive\nyou another research study from 2014\nshowed that apologies reduce feelings of\nanger basically a simple but sincere\napology can help get rid of all of the\nnegative tension between you two\ndo you sometimes feel awkward\napologizing even though you would like\nto\ntry writing it out no not a text that\nsays sorry pour your heart out and\napologize with a letter or small note on\nthe fridge we bet your partner will\ndefinitely appreciate it number two\nattached to you ancient Greeks talked\nabout the mysteries of love and gave it\nits own story\naccording to their mythology humans were\noriginally created with four arms four\nlegs and a head with two faces but only\none heart Zeus became afraid their\npowers would overcome his own so he\nsplit them into two separate parts\nthose parts then spent their lives in\nsearch of their other halves\nthis piece of Mythology explains why\nromance is sometimes described as two\nbodies one soul but is that really the\ncase\nsometimes those in relationships can\ndevelop an unhealthy dependency on their\nPartners when they become emotionally\nattached or lose their sense of identity\noutside of the relationship a 2018 study\nshowed that emotional dependence in a\nrelationship can be a sign of childhood\ntrauma and preoccupied attachment if you\nhave developed this unhealthy attachment\nyou might neglect all of your friends\nand only hang out with your partner you\nalso might depend on your partner for\nemotional Comfort instead of regulating\nemotions on your own do you feel like\nyou don't know who you are without your\npartner or like you depend on them\nthis could be another trait that's\nkilling your relationship\nnumber three my crystal ball is broken\ncommunication is the key to\nrelationships this may sound a bit\ncliche but numerous psychological\nstudies over the years proved the\nimportance of clear communication with\nyour partner for example a 2021 study\npublished in Personality and Social\nPsychology bulletin showed that your\nrelationship May flourish if you avoid\nnegative communication patterns like\nmaking assumptions\nwhen you and your partner don't\ncommunicate your needs and wants with\neach other you're forcing each other to\nread each other's minds\nyou might assume what the other one is\nthinking or put incorrect labels on each\nother for example your partner might\nfeel tired from a 12-hour shift at work\nbut you assume they're mad at you and\nuninterested in speaking to you you say\nthings like what did I do to you now or\nso you're just giving me the silent\ntreatment now you're angry for no reason\nand your partner may now be confused or\nam I getting angry back\nthis whole situation escalated because\ncommunication didn't happen to avoid\nputting yourself in such situations make\nsure to communicate your wants and needs\nclearly maybe your partner tells you how\nexhausted they are when they get home\nmaybe you ask why they're being so quiet\nif you find yourself trying to assume\nyour partner's wants and needs just stop\nand ask more times than not your\nassumption will not be completely true\nand number four micromanaging\nokay you found the love of your life as\nyour relationship starts to progress you\nand your partner may start spending more\ntime with one another sleeping over at\neach other's places may happen so often\nto where you end up moving in together\nthis can be when you start noticing\nlittle things about your partner that\nmay just irk you for example they might\nleave their clothes all over the floor\ninstead of putting them in the hamper or\nputting your cereal in the wrong\ncupboard\nwhen that happens how do you respond one\ncommon response that can kill a\nrelationship is micromanaging this is\nwhen you try to control every aspect of\nanother person including their actions\nclinical psychologist Karen Nemo said on\nmedium the micromanagers often have\nextremely high standards so they\nstruggle to trust their Partners to do\nthings as well as they do this type of\ncontrolling Behavior can drive the other\nside crazy\nthey might start feeling incompetent\nresentful or anxious wondering if they\ncan ever do anything right if you are\nmicromanaging your partner this could be\na sign of other mental health diagnosis\nsuch as anxiety or potentially\nobsessive-compulsive disorder if you\nfeel like you're micromanaging reach out\nto a mental health professional to help\nstop this behavior that could be killing\nyour relationship\na list of toxic behaviors is kind of\nendless if you want to learn about five\nmore relationship killing
