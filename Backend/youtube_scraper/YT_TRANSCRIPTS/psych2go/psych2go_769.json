    "transcript": "how strict is strict enough can only a\nstrict parent be a good parent those who\nare strict but loving are known as\nauthoritative but those who are strict\ncontrolling cold and emotionless are\nknown as authoritarian\neven if it seems like extreme parenting\nis necessary to teach children\ndiscipline research shows that it\nactually creates the complete opposite\neffect\nchildren raised by very strict parents\ngrow up with all kinds of different\nstruggles with their thoughts emotions\nand behavior\ndo you suffer the side effects if you're\nnot sure what the side effects are here\nare six common ones number one the inner\ncritic you don't study enough your room\nis not clean enough\ndoes it sound familiar if you had strict\nparents you are probably used to all\nkinds of critique growing up you might\nhave felt like you never did anything\nright\nmaybe you felt constant fear of being\ncriticized and felt like no matter what\nyou do you'd never be good enough\nthese feelings nurtured your inner\ncritic and made it grow alongside you so\ntoday you might criticize yourself\nconstantly maybe you keep bringing\nyourself down apologizing for doing\nthings wrong or warning everyone that\nyou'll probably do it wrong\nyou become quick to point out your flaws\nbefore anyone else this becomes a\nstrategy to protect yourself in hopes\nthat if I criticize myself first no one\nelse can\nunfortunately this can often backfire\nbecause your own thoughts can be even\nmore harsh than your parents were\nnumber two\nthe bad person\nare you afraid to show your true self to\nothers because you're scared of\nrejection\nthis lack of self-esteem and\nself-confidence is another common side\neffect of strict parenting\nif your parents always had high\nexpectations you may have set those same\nexpectations for yourself and as time\nwent on maybe you internalized those\nexpectations as a part of you now you\nmay feel like you're worth as a person\ndepends completely on your results\nso if you fail to meet those high\nexpectations you may feel like you're\nbad in nature\nsome who were raised in a strict home\ndescribe this as feeling like they're\nfundamentally bad if they don't succeed\nin following the rules or living up to\nunrealistic standards\nthree The Art of Lying\nwhile you were growing up did your\nparents always forbid you from doing\nanything fun maybe you weren't allowed\nto go out with friends or have\nsleepovers most of the time you did\nfollow the rules blindly but maybe you\nsnuck out every now and then strict\nparents often expect obedience and\nrespect for authority they believe\nthey're raising honest and respectful\npeople but in response to all these\nstrict measures children learn to act\nsneaky and become excellent Liars from\nan early age it becomes important to\nlearn how to hide secrets and tell a few\nWhite Lies every now and then you had to\nmaster the art of Lang because you\nfeared the possible punishment so now\ncoming up with a convincing lie is a\nmatter of seconds\nnumber four the rules I can't wait until\nI get out of here\nI can't wait to live however I want\nwithout any rules but the truth is those\nrules got ingrained in you to the point\nthat you now feel like you just can't\nlive without them anymore\ndo you feel like you have a need for\nrules and structure one example of this\nneed could be functioning in Social\nsettings for example you may feel a bit\nmore comfortable at work or school not\nbecause you know the rules you know how\nyou're supposed to behave and what's\nexpected of you but when you're at a\nparty you're not so sure anymore\nwhat do you talk about how do you act in\nthese situations the rules and structure\nare not clear\nwhere some adults that grew up with\nstrict parents this can become a\nchallenge and they might feel lost\nwithout the guidance\nnumber five the rebel\nI'm helping you get disciplined I want\nyou to become a well-behaved adult\nstrict parents often justify themselves\nby thinking their parenting methods\nwould make you a polite and disciplined\nperson\nbut Studies have shown that harsh\nparenting actually produces kids with\nbehavioral problems they might have\nlearned to become more rebellious angry\nimpulsive and aggressive when things\ndon't go their way also they're more\nlikely to engage in Risky Behavior such\nas running away or experimenting with\ndrugs it might be because you want to\ncompensate for the lost time to some\npeople it may feel like finally being\nreleased to Freedom after feeling like a\nprisoner their entire life\nand number six\nthe sadness\nunfortunately strict parenting can have\nserious side effects on your mental\nhealth as well\nstudies show that kids raised in a\nstrict household tend to be unhappy and\nshow more depressive symptoms do you\nfeel sad or anxious as a result of your\nupbringing if you often feel hopeless\ntired bored and if you feel like you\ndon't enjoy things that you used to you\nmay be suffering from depression on top\nof increasing your chances of developing\nmental illness strict parenting\nincreases the risk of suicide research\nhas shown that in some countries such as\nHong Kong and Australia kids raised in\nstrict households are more prone to\nsuicidal attempts or ideation please\nremember if you or someone you know\nshows signs or symptoms of suicidal\nideation please contact a mental health\nprofessional or visit the link for\ninternational suicide hotlines in the\ndescription box below\ngrowing up this way may have left you\nfeeling hurt and confused and\nunfortunately it takes some time to\nrecover from the lack of love and\nabundance of harsh rules a good way to\nstart that Journey would be to\nacknowledge that you shouldn't feel\nguilty or ashamed\naccept yourself for who you are even if\nyou sometimes make mistakes the mistakes\nare what make you human even if your\nparents never realized that\ndo you relate to the points mentioned in\nthis video what are some other side\neffects of strict parenting that you\nhave noticed if you found this
