    "transcript": "have you or anyone you know ever\nexperienced depression according to the\nAmerican Psychological Association some\nof the most common signs of depression\ninclude frequent feelings of tiredness\ndifficulty concentrating social\nwithdrawal and emotional Detachment but\nwhen you imagine someone who can't focus\non their tasks has low energy and spends\nmost of their time alone and at home it\ncan be easy to mistake it for a simple\nbout of laziness so how do you tell the\ndifference well here are seven\npsychology-backed signs to help you\nfigure out if what you're experiencing\nis just laziness or something more\nserious number one you used to be highly\nself-motivated\nfirst and foremost the most important\nway we can distinguish laziness from\ndepression is to look at how the person\nacts now and compare it to how they used\nto be since laziness is a relatively\nstable character trait it should stand a\nreason that someone who's just lazy has\nprobably always been this way whereas\nsomeone who used to be highly\nself-motivated and high achieving but\nsuddenly isn't anymore might actually be\nstruggling with depression number two\nyou've lost interest in everything in\nyour life\nsimilar to the last point if you feel\nthat you've lost not only your\nmotivation but also your interest to do\njust about anything even the things you\nused to love and were passionate about\nthen it might not be laziness you're\nstruggling with but depression in fact a\nmarkedly diminished interest or pleasure\nin activities is one of the Hallmarks of\na depressive episode this is especially\ntrue if your laziness happens not only\ntowards the things you usually don't\nwant to do like chores or homework but\neven at the hobbies and activities you\nused to enjoy number three you feel like\nyou can't do anything anymore do you\nfeel like you just can't bring yourself\nto do anything perhaps you feel like\nyour laziness is getting out of hand\nbecause it's getting in the way of your\nwork studies and or relationships but in\ntruth if you're already struggling to\nfunction mentally emotionally physically\nor socially you may be dealing with\nsomething much more serious than\nlaziness number four you don't know why\nyou feel the way you do have you been\nfeeling upset but you don't know why\nanother sign that there may be more to\nyour laziness than you think is if it's\naccompanied by a lot of negative\nfeelings that you just can't seem to\nmake sense of whether it's loneliness\nsadness hopelessness or even anger you\nmight find no obvious culprit Behind\nThese Feelings which can be frustrating\nand Troublesome so if you've been\nfeeling this way lately and don't know\nwhy\nit could be because you're actually\ndepressed number five you struggle with\nother unexplained symptoms have you been\nable to sleep well recently apart from\nthe emotional total depression can cause\nyou may also experience physiological\nsymptoms as well this may include\nfinding yourself sleeping too much\nlosing your appetite or overeating too\nmuch out of the blue other common\nexamples include sudden heart\npalpitations racing heartbeat difficulty\nbreathing chest pains and chronic pain\nand fatigue even when doing nothing\nnumber six you don't know why you've\nsuddenly become lazy a lot of the time\npeople tend to become lazy when they\nfeel overwhelmed or pressured to succeed\nthey may also procrastinate due to low\nself-esteem or lack of discipline and\nself-control or a lack of positive\nrecognition from others but if none of\nthese seem to describe you and you just\nfeel like you suddenly became lazy for\nno apparent reason then it might be\ndepression you're experiencing\npsychologists are currently still\nstruggling to figure out why some people\nbecome depressed but the bottom line is\nif you feel that nothing has triggered\nyour sudden bout of unexplained laziness\nthis might be the reason why and number\nseven you're trying your best not to be\nlazy\nlast but certainly not least if you've\nmade every effort you can to try to snap\nyourself out of your own laziness but\njust can't seem to then it might be\nbecause it's not actually laziness at\nall that you're experiencing it's\ndepression see unlike depression\nlaziness can be easily remedied there\nare a lot of productivity hacks you can\napply to help get you out of your funk\nbut depression is a whole other story if\nleft undiagnosed and untreated it can\nworsen over time and increase the\nlikelihood of risky behaviors such as\nsubstance abuse addiction self-harm and\nsuicidal ideation fortunately the\nNational Health Institute has reported\nthat more than 80 percent of people who\nseek professional help for it do recover\nand get better so if you're struggling\ndon't hesitate to seek help did you\nrelate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here if so please reach
