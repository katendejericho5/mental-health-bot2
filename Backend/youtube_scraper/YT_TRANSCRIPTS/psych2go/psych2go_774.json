    "transcript": "do Attractive people tend to have better\npartners\nwell isn't that a loaded question what\nexactly do we mean by better anyhow do\nwe mean richer more physically\nattractive and more successful or do we\nmean a better match to the person\nthey're with or does better simply mean\nmore\nthey are in for a ride folks because to\ngive a best possible answer for this\nquestion we're going to have to consider\nand look at how we form relationships\nand break down an explanation of\nAttraction so please after you let's\nstart this knowledge Safari\nnumber one where do we meet potential\npartners\nin Broad General Strokes we meet\npotential Partners wherever we\nconsistently spend time the specific\nwhere has had a massive change in the\nlast decade in ye olden days when the\ninternet was a dream this place of\nmeeting required physically going out\nall the time hello introvert nightmare\nnow the internet has brought us virtual\nplaces to consistently spend time with\nothers like dating apps chat rooms and\nforums significantly expanding the\npossibilities\nalthough there's still a tendency to\nselect and date someone who is within\nthe local area we now have the\nopportunity to get to know those who\nmaybe don't party drink or join clubs\nnumber two\nis it really all about looks\nwe'll give you the short answer but only\nif you stay to hear the full answer deal\nthe short answer is yes the real answer\nthough is far more nuanced while some\nanimals may use scent or even sound\nhumans generally depend on how things\nlook as an initial assessment to decide\nwhether to look further or to reject\ndeeper investigation\nit's fair to say that we decide if there\nis a higher or lower chance of good\noutcome initially based on looks an\nexample would be if you saw a chocolate\ncake that looked like chocolate cake and\nnext to it was chocolate cake that was\nmade to look like a mound of rotting\ndirt\nwe'd be more inclined to choose the cake\nlooking cake even if told beforehand\nthat they had the same ingredients and\nwere baked by the same person\nfurther down the road it's been found\nthat we tend to partner up date or\notherwise have relationships with those\nwho are within the same range of\nphysical attractiveness as ourselves\nso really it's a matter of like attracts\nlike\nnumber three looks matter but only to a\npoint\nso to get that initial foot in the door\nsure looks matter as far as signaling\nthat you're probably a decent enough\nperson to get to know\nas fine as meeting someone is we know\nthat the goal is likely not to only know\na person superficially for a day or two\nto have a partner you would want\nsomething that has some staying power\nthe traits fueling that staying power\nare according to a 2021 study warmth\nintimacy and loyalty\nthat's right it's not driven by the body\nmeasurement or cheekbone height as looks\nare transient it can be argued that the\nwarmth intimacy and loyalty far outweigh\nlooks and overall importance\nthis is where that inner beauty really\nshines and takes its place as the\ndriving force for a lasting meaningful\npartnership\nnumber four when we love we see the\nbeauty in our partners\ncan what you are inside actually\nmanifest outside to our partners this\ndoes seem to be the case\nwe could speculate that it's because\nover time one gets desensitized or\nnormalized to anything even the Helen of\nTroy of beauties the thing that affects\nus deeply emotionally and\npsychologically will be the intangible\ntraits mentioned before so if your\npartner has a beautiful soul that will\naffect how they seem Through Your Eyes\nin fact it was found that there's even a\ntendency to see our romantic Partners is\nmore attractive than ourselves that's\ntrue love for you so in the end do the\npretty people tend to have better\npartners\nit would seem that while they might have\nmore chances to start something this by\nno means ensures a better partnership\noverall\na healthy strong and loving relationship\ndepends on so much more than that which\nis Skin Deep\nso choose a relationship that helps make\nyou a better version of yourself in all\naspects\nwhat are your thoughts on the\nattractiveness Factor have you heard of\nany other theories please share discuss\nand comment thank you for watching and\nwe'll see you next time"
