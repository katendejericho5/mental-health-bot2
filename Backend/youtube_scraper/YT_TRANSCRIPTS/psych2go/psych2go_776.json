    "transcript": "hi everyone what do you do when you\nexperience unwanted emotions for some\npeople resort to talking it out trying\nto cope or simply by just eating\nsomething\nbut for intense emotions this might not\nalways work\nI'm Monica and I'm a first year medic\nand graduate in Neuroscience during my\nclinical observerships I've seen\nSurgical and Medical emergencies things\nthat you could say sometimes weren't\nsome really intense emotions\nand so I think it's especially important\nto have skills to be able to process\ntheir emotions so that we're best able\nto learn and to grow from these\nexperiences\nand that's today's topic of the ask an\nexpert Series where we chat with experts\nabout topics around mental health\nPsychiatry and neurology\nI am so honored to introduce you to Emma\nfrom therapy in a nutshell today where\nwe'll be talking about how to process\nyour emotions welcome Emma hi thanks for\nhaving me thank you so much for being\nhere could you just introduce yourself\nto everyone to tell everyone about the\namazing work that you do thanks so I'm\nuh Emma McAdam I'm a licensed marriage\nand family therapist and I am also the\ncreator of the YouTube channel therapy\nin a nutshell and I just boil down\nmental health education and skills into\nlittle bite-sized packages so that\npeople can can learn how to work through\nyou know big emotions\nwonderful and I've seen you've had work\ndone on your Channel about processing\nemotions and it's such a big topic that\nyou even have a whole course devoted to\nit so I think we could just probably\njust Dive Right In and just to start for\nthose who are unsure or completely new\nto the area of emotional processing what\ndoes it actually mean to process your\nemotions\nyeah so I think a lot of times when\npeople are trying to figure out what to\ndo with a big feeling like oh I feel\nreally sad or I feel really anxious or\nI'm experiencing a lot of grief they\nthey might wonder what do I do about\nthis feeling and if you if you do a\ntypical search and you look for the\nanswer to that question you're gonna get\nsome kind of Pat answer in some kind of\narticle that's like oh you know take a\ndeep breath Journal about it talk about\nit\num or reach out to a therapist and\nthat's like the answers you see like\nover and over and over again but\nwhat people might be looking for is like\nthe answer like the single answer like\noh you should do this and then it will\ngo away and the reality is emotions are\nreally big and they're really complex\nand that kind of Pat answer usually\ndoesn't suffice because processing\nemotions involves a bunch of little\nsteps and what I do is I teach people\nhow to work through these steps so if\npeople are familiar with my YouTube\nchannel they'll know I've got a course\non it and it's got 31 videos as like the\nmain like the main steps because that's\nlike the the fewest I could break it\ndown to is like 31 Little Steps but\nthere is an overall process and the and\nthe overall big picture process is this\nidea when you have really big emotions\nyou take them and you have to first\nstart where you stand and notice them\nand name them what am I feeling right\nand then you have to create space\nbecause our immediate reaction is to\navoid or Escape or suppress emotions so\nyou create space to have those emotions\nand this next process is called\nwillingness and that's from acceptance a\ncommitment therapy so you allow yourself\nto feel emotions and then there are a\nbunch of other little steps you can use\nto work through emotions instead of\nmaking them worse by trying to suppress\nthem or avoid them so\nit seems like there is definitely a lot\nto break down I think what might be more\nuseful do you think we should come up\nwith like a sample situation that people\nmight\nexperience from like I don't know\nanxiety or like depression or do you\nthink it's more useful to talk about\nGeneral kind of\num what is it called\num kind of pillars and go from there\nyeah that's a great question I mean it's\nit's easy for me to work when we do have\nan example so you can if you can come up\nwith an example of someone who's\nexperiencing an intense emotion then we\ncould definitely you know break it down\ninto practical steps\nI thought I definitely think social\nanxiety is a really big one I mean just\nwhen I was starting out to do these\nstreams it was one where I was like an\nemotion I was always feeling like oh my\ngosh I'm so worried and everything but\nuh while things have gotten a lot better\nI think it's always good to really know\nhow to process it so to improve for the\nnext streams and so on so yeah we could\ndefinitely use social anxiety as one of\nthem and I see in the comments here as\nwell that people resonate with that yeah\nfor sure yeah and social anxiety is one\nof the most common experiences out there\nlike\num like like it's one of the highest\npercentages\nof disorders that people experience but\neven when it's not disordered the vast\nmajority of people experience social\nanxiety at some point in their lives\nso something that's really common with\nsocial anxiety is that people um get\nanxious about their anxiety right\nthey'll be they'll be presenting and\nthey'll notice like oh I'm feeling shaky\nor I'm feeling sweaty\num they'll be you know talking in front\nof people or even at a party and they'll\nbe observing themselves and be like oh\nmy gosh am I making enough eye contact\nlike what if I get nervous I can't get\nnervous and then if they start to get\nnervous then they'll they'll feel bad\nand the number one most common thing\npeople do is\num try to like if they're giving a\npresentation they'll try to like\nsuppress those feelings like oh I can't\nfeel anxious right now I can't get all\nsweaty right now my voice can't get\nshaky right now they'll make all these\nrules about what they can and can't feel\nor if they're at a party they're like oh\nif I get anxious I'm not going\nright they'll avoid these are our most\ncommon reactions to emotions it's like\ngotta make this go away and and in some\nways our society has created this belief\nthat like having\num anxiety is a bad thing\nand that it's dangerous to have anxiety\nso we get anxious around our anxiety and\nso when it comes to processing social\nanxiety in those two situations let's\nsay one is like just interacting with\nfriends and the other might be a\npresentation first thing to do is to\ncheck your rules around anxiety and if\nyou have the rule it's like it's not\nokay to feel anxious I have to leave if\nI feel anxious I have to make my heart\nstop beating so fast I have to make my\nbreathing\nstop breathing so fast that's actually\ngoing to make you feel worse so we\ntalked about noticing a name and you say\noh hey\nhi anxiety glad to see you showed up\ntoday and then we let go of judgment and\nthis is all kind of this first step in\nEmotion processing letting go of\njudgment and suppression and avoid and\nsay hey it's okay to feel anxious\nit's okay to feel anxious and do it\nanyway I feel anxious about being on\nYouTube live right now and I'm gonna do\nit anyway like that's just part of\nliving a meaningful life is that things\nare going to be uncomfortable sometimes\nso when it comes to emotion processing\nthe first thing you have to do is kind\nof let go of the struggle against\nemotion stop labeling them as bad stop\nthinking of emotions as being positive\nand negative and instead describe them\nis this uncomfortable or is this\ncomfortable that's more of a descriptive\nterm than like a oh this is terrible\nthat I feel this way okay\num and and this process with acceptance\ncommitment therapy is called willingness\nit's it's creating space to feel and you\ntell yourself I can allow myself to feel\nuncomfortable emotions without needing\nto make them go away and it's actually a\nskill that you can practice one of the\nways I teach people to practice it is\nwith like physical Sensations so you\ncould practice doing something that's\nphysically uncomfortable like holding an\nice cube or doing a wall sit or even if\nit's safely medically to hold your\nbreath for a little while and to notice\nwhat those physical Sensations are and\ninstead of being like oh this hurts so\nmuch it's terrible see like oh I'm so\ncurious what does this what does this\nfeel like to be doing a deep squat right\nnow and you can increase your emotional\nawareness around that so that's really\nthe the big first part of emotion\nprocessing and I I've mentioned that\nquite a bit is like\ncreating space to feel your emotions and\nand this is so observing what you're\nfeeling and then just being really\nwilling to feel it instead of creating\nall these labels and rules around it\nand is that different for someone who\nexperiences like everyday anxiety uh\ncompared to someone who experiences\nmaybe a full-on anxiety disorder are\nthose steps still the same or are there\nslight modifications that one would need\nto make\nit's a really good question\num and\nthis comes down to how I personally\nconceptualize anxiety and anxiety\ndisorders\num there are different therapists who\ntake different approaches and and that's\nokay I think each person needs to\nconsider\nwhich type of conceptualization is going\nto be most helpful for them when it\ncomes to their anxiety and their anxiety\ndisorder so for some people choosing to\nsay I have an anxiety disorder and\nbecause of this I'm going to\num choose to limit certain things I do\nlike oh I'm not going to do public\nspeaking as my job that's okay right\nthat might be really helpful for them\nand for other people saying I experience\nan anxiety disorder but only because\nright now it's dialed up really high for\nme and I can dial it down and be more\nfunctional in this way it works so\nthe short answer to your question is\nemotion processing works for both that's\nthat's the short answer to your question\nand one of the reasons I think in this\nway I use acceptance and commitment\ntherapy and I'm just really really\ncautious about labels\nso yes anxiety disorders are genuine\nreal experience they interfere with your\nfunctioning and they're very\nuncomfortable\nbut I'm very cautious about someone\nlabeling themselves like the helpfulness\nof someone labeling themselves as being\nan anxious person or as that's who I am\nor I have this I have this uh disorder\nand it's a permanent trait of mine\nversus this is an experience I'm having\nI'm going to choose adaptive and\nflexible ways to manage it so I choose\nto lean on the like this is an\nexperience whether it's really severe or\nnot and I'm going to choose adaptive\nways and flexible ways to manage it and\nif we if we conceptualize it that way\nsomeone who does have an anxiety\ndisorder like social anxiety disorder\nthey they increase their options for\nmanaging it and that's what matters to\nme I just focus more on like what are we\ngoing to do about it than like\num is this a permanent situation or not\nyeah can you still hear me yeah\nI don't know why but I can't really hear\nyou very well I don't know why this my\nsituation is going on I'm gonna I'm\ngonna move my mic a little closer\nperfect and that might help yes is that\nbetter yes much better thanks for\nletting me know okay perfect yeah that's\nwhat I think too like um it's really\ngood to notice the the way that you're\nspeaking to yourself I know I had a\nstream earlier on in the\num Dr Conte who was mentioning the\nimportance of using accurate language\nbecause sometimes if we say things like\noh I have feelings that I'm you know my\nheart's racing a bit faster it's\ncompletely different than just saying oh\nmy God I'm having a mental breakdown\nright now because that is not helpful at\nall so it's good that you mentioned that\nbecause it's also a really good reminder\nfor me as well to kind of in processing\nemotions using accurate language and\ndoing so\nyep and so we use we use words to\ndescribe instead of label we use words\nto um be curious a beginner's mind this\nis from mindfulness right a beginner's\nmind we just get really curious about\nwhat we're feeling instead of um\ninstead of judging it and saying this is\nawful right and just yeah be really\ncautious with your language and and then\nthe next step with the motion processing\nis to clarify right like clarify um and\nthis includes like using a locus of\ncontrol activity like what can I control\nwhat can't I control or clarifying what\nour thoughts are right if we think oh\nthis is a catastrophe or we think oh\nthis is hard that's like two very\ndifferent ways of thinking about social\nanxiety\num and and so that's the next step in\nEmotion processing is really clarifying\nA lot of times with social anxiety one\nof the things you'll see that people\nneed to clarify is their assumptions\npeople make a lot of assumptions about\nwhat other people think so they're\nassuming everyone's judging me\neveryone's looking at me everyone must\nbe noticing how fast my heart is beating\nand thinking that I'm\nweak or unskilled or you know whatever\nit is and and so with social anxiety you\ncheck those assumptions and that's\nThe Next Step I use an acronym with\nemotion processing oh we can\num o is observe W is willingness e is\nexplore so you're just like be curious\nwhat's this feel like NC is clarifying\nclarify and calm down so you use\num\nyou use you clarify your thinking around\nthis situation what thoughts am I having\nwhat cognitive distortions am I doing\nwhat assumptions am I making that's\nthat's\num contributing to my anxiety and then\nalso using like a lot of body grounding\num experience uh exercises and\nexperiences to to calm your body down\nand I'm just going to overview this\nreally quick and then we can go back to\nany specific questions you might have so\nthen the that's the C clarify and calm\ndown and then a is act and accept so I\nkind of mentioned this in the beginning\nright I feel I feel some anxiety about\nbeing live I feel some anxiety about\npresenting and I choose that my values\nare helping people learn mental health\nskills so I'm going to choose to engage\nin this activity anyways I'm going to\naccept that anxiety is part of living a\nfull and meaningful life for me and I'm\ngoing to take action to be here right\nnow and in the end I just threw in the\nend so that it makes a cute acronym oh\nwe can\nyep that's what the end's for so o is\nobserved w is be willing to feel let go\nof your rules and your struggle is\nExplorer C is clarify and calm your body\na is act and accept and then n is just\nbecause you can do it\nI'm taking notes because this is\nwonderful I love acronyms and this\nhelpful memory mnemonics that you can\napply\num\nyes so oh observe W willingness the\nexplore C clarify calm down a act\nintercept and you can do it yeah and\nbecause you can we can yeah yeah that's\nthe acronym I use and there's like a\nlittle download on my website if people\nwant to see an overview of the process\nokay wonderful we'll definitely include\na link in the after the stream\num and in terms of kind of processing\nyour motions for like different sort of\nkind of feelings so we have anxiety but\nthen we also have things like\ndepression things that sometimes don't\nhave necessarily and and like organic\ncause you can say or something you can\npinpoint say this is the reason why I'm\nfeeling this way how would you process\nthose emotions yeah so depression I\nwould consider depression for example as\nbeing one um\nlike a like a ball of yarn that has been\nwound and wound and wound and wound\nright like so you might have a lot of\nexperiences like as a child maybe you\nexperience some trauma or abuse and then\nas an adult you started creating these\nconceptualizations like Oh I'm a bad\nperson I'm a lazy person and that's\nanother string that winds around it or\nyou might have\num like some discouraging experiences or\num you might have learned that the best\nway to respond to situations is to to\nkind of give up to curl up in a ball or\nI like to be like I this is like the\nmost of that like I'm not gonna succeed\nat this so I might as well quit trying\nand so like depression is such a huge\nbundle of consistent experiences that\nadd up to this overwhelming experience\nso processing depression looks like\nbreaking it down into tiny tiny little\nlittle Snippets at a time\nso you might be having a hard time\ngetting out of bed in the morning and if\nyou were to process that experience\nyou'd say oh I'm gonna instead of\njudging myself right now instead of\njudging myself as being a bad lazy\nperson I'm gonna notice that thought and\nthat's kind of the observing part of oh\nwe can right I'm going to observe myself\nlaying in bed and instead of judging\nmyself and labeling myself and beating\nmyself up I'm just gonna be really\ncurious what does it feel like to not\nwant to get out of bed and I'm going to\nbe willing to let myself feel that\nsadness just for a few minutes it\ndoesn't mean you have to accept that\nyou're gonna feel sad forever that's the\nwillingness I'm gonna explore if there's\nany thoughts this is the e I'm going to\nexplore if there's any thoughts that are\ncontributing to this like oh I have to\ndo everything or else I'm gonna do\nnothing like that's a cognitive\ndistortion that might lead to like\nstaying in bed all morning\nand I'm going to clarify that is that\ntrue you have to do everything today or\nyou might as well not get out of bed hmm\nlet's let's challenge that thought\nlet's be really gentle with myself while\nI do this like really compassionate but\nlike say well maybe what if I just did\none thing this morning maybe I just get\nout of bed and wash my face and then I\ncan get back in bed\nthat's a clarification type activity and\nthen you choose an action or you accept\nand that's the next step right is actor\naccepts you say well maybe I'll get up\nI'll wash my face I'll get back in bed\nand that's how you could like break down\nemotion processing for depression when\ndepression is such a huge you know\nbundle of yarn we just take it like one\nminute five minutes at a time something\nlike that\nokay I see so we're gonna kind of\nprogress in the in terms of more complex\nsituations so that's okay because I\nthink I understand and hopefully the\naudience also understands like the idea\nof\num oh we can for social anxiety or\nsituations that we can clearly identify\nthis is a stimulus that causes us to\nfeel certain way and depression where\nthere might be tons of things that cause\nus to feel a specific way\num but what happens for things like\nschizophrenia when our ability to then\nprocess and to understand the world\nmight not be\num\nat its full potential oh that's such a\ngreat question I love it and um you know\nacceptance commitment therapy has been\nshown to be effective that's one of my\nmain models I use a lot of different\nmodels but acceptance of commitment\ntherapy has been shown to be effective\nto a degree for people with\nschizophrenia because it does help them\nbe more accepting of their experiences\nincluding their experiences like\nhallucinations or delusions things like\nthat\num so that those first steps of\nobserving and noticing you might be like\noh I I'm feeling I'm feeling off I'm\nfeeling confused or I'm noticing this um\nthis hallucination and and you can still\nprocess it in a way but for a lot of\npeople when our emotions get really\nextreme when we're experiencing like a\ncrisis\num we have to include scaffolds around\nour processing experience because\nbasically when we're highly emotional\nthe thinking part of our brain shuts\ndown and um so I'm I'm imagining right\nnow someone having a panic attack I'm\nimagining someone having maybe like a a\nsevere break like someone just broke up\nwith them and they're like super upset\nand I'm not an expert with schizophrenia\nso I'm not going to address that one as\nmuch and hopefully leave that to people\nwho are a little bit more expert in that\narea\num but with really extreme emotions\nwhere you can't just calmly work through\nthem\nwe create scaffolds\nto support the thinking part of our\nbrain so when we're experiencing an\nattention to motion the fight-or-flight\nresponse goes off in our brain and the\nhigher thinking process is shut down and\nwe just go into this kind of more\nemotionally reactive part of our brains\nso we have to turn we have to have these\nhabits and routines that help us process\nemotions and that includes things like\ntalking to someone so anything that\nmakes processing\num anything that makes your emotions and\nthoughts concrete is helpful so that's\nlike talking to someone that makes it\nout loud instead of putting it in your\nhead that makes it more concrete writing\nit down that helps make it more physical\nand concrete and makes it more clear and\nyou might be really surprised at how\nwriting things down really helps when\nyou're anxious or depressed or grieving\nor hurt or offended or angry it just\nhelps your brain slow things down\nbecause what's going on is the thinking\npart of your brain the frontal part of\nyour brain is not as engaged you'll also\nsee this is helpful with people with\nlike ADHD right like they're having a\nhard time with executive functioning\nthey're having a hard time getting their\num the the Boss part of their brain to\ntell the emotional part of their brain\nlike chill out it's gonna be okay let's\nthink through this rationally so\num all of this scaffolding is really\nhelpful when you're highly highly\nemotional or dealing with intense\nstruggles other types of activities that\nthat are helpful with the scaffolding\nand and this all includes like I love\npaper right like I love writing things\ndown physically Nick wignall he's one of\nmy favorite bloggers he says never worry\nin your head write it down so you can do\nan activity like scheduled worry where\nevery day at 12 30 you write down your\nworries and you put them on paper and\nthat helps you process them you can do\nan activity that helps clarify like a\nlocus of control activity where you\nwrite you take a piece of paper and and\nyou put a line down the middle and you\nwrite on one side of the piece of paper\nlike this is in my control and on the\nother side you write this is out of my\ncontrol and you write it down you just\nput everything down and that helps\nclarify that's the C step in Emotion\nprocessing\num and and so\ndid that answer your question like when\nthings are really extreme how can you\nuse emotion processing using scaffolds\nto support the thinking part of our\nbrain yes I think so and I think it's\nreally nice that you wrote out you you\nsaid that you wrote things out as well\nbecause I think that's also very helpful\nI wasn't even aware of this the term for\nit but I've always been a really big fan\nof journaling and I think scheduling\ntime during the day to just think and\njust to write things out and make things\nconcrete has been very very helpful so\nthank you for also bringing that up yeah\nyeah for sure\num so at this point I just thought I\nwould summarize kind of the points that\nwe've mentioned and then I want to\nintroduce a very special guest to\neveryone as well Michelle who has been\nhelping out with this ask an expert live\nstream\num she will be interacting with you all\nand\num picking some of the questions that\nyou've asked so if you have questions\nfeel free to put them in the chat now\nand they'll possibly be answered\num so for the summary essentially we\nexplored oh we can observe willingness\nexplore clarify and calm down act and\naccept and for you could do it as a good\nway for\num processing our emotions we've also\nused some concrete examples so we talked\nabout social anxiety and we mentioned\ndepression and more complex situations\nlike\num schizophrenia so with that I am going\nto introduce you all to Michelle\nhi Michelle\nI think she's muted\nhey everyone I'm super excited to be\nhere\nwelcome so I'll give this to you for the\nlast little bit to just interact with\nthe audience and see if anyone has any\nquestions about processing emotions and\nyeah\num I just wanted to introduce myself I'm\nMichelle and I'm going to be hosting my\nown live stream in a few weeks for ask\nan advocate on topics about mental\nhealth awareness and access to health\ncare\nso um I'm going to be taking some\nquestions from the audience I have a few\nright here and so the first one is Emma\nhow do you suggest getting out of a bad\nrelationship especially if it causes you\nanxiety this was asked by a heli\nso I guess my first question is does the\nrelationship cause you anxiety or\nleaving the relationship cause you\nanxiety and I know we can't really\nclarify that but if if the relationship\ncauses you anxiety\nlaughs\nI might have an answer that people don't\ndon't like how do you get out of a bad\nrelationship if you know the\nrelationship is toxic\nyou've got to start with an affirmation\nand saying like here is like real\nClarity on who you are and what you want\nin your relationship so you clarify your\nvalues I want a relationship where we\nare able to talk about difficult\nproblems in a healthy way I want a\nrelationship where\num I am treated with respect I want a\nrelationship where we share Mutual goals\nor whatever that is right so you as long\nas you're centered in your own belief of\nwho you are what you want your life to\nbe about and what you are and aren't\nwilling to accept in a relationship\nthat's got to be your first step because\nthen you can know what those those\nboundaries are now if you're anxious\nabout setting those boundaries if you're\nanxious about like the boundaries like I\nwill leave because this isn't getting\nmet then\num\nit's not going to be very popular but\na lot of people want the anxiety to go\naway before they take the action that\nthey need to take oh when I'm not\nanxious then I'll do a presentation when\nI'm not anxious then I'll set this\nboundary when I feel comfortable then\nI'll say no to my boss right and instead\nI say you got to reverse that you've got\nto say even though I feel anxious I'm\ngoing to make the right choice for me e\neven though I feel anxious I'm going to\ngive this presentation and that's what\nacceptance and commitment therapy is all\nabout right and emotion processing and\nsaying I'm going to allow these emotions\nto be here and still choose to act on my\nvalues so I would just I love values\nclarification activities what do I value\nwhat do I believe in and maybe you\nbelieve maybe the reason you're anxious\nabout breaking up is because you really\nvalue being kind and then you have this\nfalse rule in your head that says being\nkind means never making anyone else sad\nthat rule is false right being kind\nincludes\ntelling people no because that's kind to\nyourself and it's probably kind for them\nright if the relationship's going\nnowhere breaking up with them is\nactually a very caring and compassionate\nthing to do because you care about their\nhappiness so you say\nI value kindness\nI'm going to do this even though this\nhurts and I can handle feeling\nuncomfortable emotions that doesn't mean\nit's a bad choice\nno that's a great explanation I agree\nwith you like valuing kindness that's\nextremely important in anything\num another question and this was asked\nby Liam and it's been asked by a few\npeople but\num he asked Emma can you give advice to\nsomeone on how to help a friend or a\nsibling that has thoughts of self-harm\nhmm\nit's a good question it's a big question\nhow to help a friend or sibling who has\nthoughts of self-harm first thing to say\nI would say is ask them about it\nstraight up so there's good evidence\nshowing that if you ask someone directly\nare you feeling suicidal are you having\nthoughts of hurting yourself\nthat's not going to make them like\nthis brand new idea come into their head\nand they're suddenly going to be more\nlikely to self-harm so get be willing to\nask the really hard questions\num the second I would say is like know\nwhat your resources are in your area and\nknow what resources are available for\npeople so in the United States we've got\nthe 988 that's the new Suicide\nPrevention Hotline you can call them for\nspecific advice for you like oh how can\nI help someone and a therapist can give\nyou their time to talk you through some\noptions and in addition to that you know\nyour friend or sibling can also call\nthat line\num I would say get really good at the\nskill of empathic listening so where you\ncan listen without needing to\nnecessarily give a lot of advice or tell\npeople what to do or talk about yourself\nlike learn to listen well and ask a good\ngood open-ended questions like oh what's\nthat like for you you know ask questions\nlike that instead of um just feeling\nlike you need to give them a lot of\nadvice\n[Music]\num\nyeah that that's those are the first\nthings that come to my mind but you can\ncall that 988 number yourself and ask a\na counselor there for suggestions for\nyour specific situation and then of\ncourse you know always try to\nhelp them get the resources that can\nsupport them so if they're in school\nthere might be resources in their school\nin your local community there might be\nMental Health Resources in their um\nlocal community or in in your church or\nin your in your network so get more\npeople involved like if you're the only\nperson who knows that this person is\nsuicidal that's very heavy for you and\num I would say get get more people\ninvolved more friends more parents more\nteachers more administrators more\num Community Support\nthank you so much and then um Tristan\nasks how do I process my emotions in an\nargument with my girlfriend if she\ndoesn't want to continue the argument\nand it's left open-ended\n[Music]\num\nthat's hard right it can be really hard\nto tolerate those those relation like\nlike a fight in a relationship because I\nthink for a lot of us we want\num our relationships to always feel good\nand to always be happy and never have\nany problems it's really hard for me\nlike if I have a disagreement with my\nhusband and it's left open for me to not\nwant to just keep going back and fixing\nit so I think the first thing to\nrecognize is that processing emotions is\nan internal process\num and your half of this disagreement is\nwhat's in your control so I do the locus\nof control activity right what's in my\ncontrol what isn't and just clarify that\nright off the bat I can't change how she\nfeels I can't change what she thinks I\ncan't change how she acts I can't change\nwhat she does right and you change like\nwhat can I do I can work on myself\nI can learn what to do with my own\nfeelings in regard to this argument I\ncan learn new ways to communicate on my\nhalf of this relationship and um you\nknow when I was in training one of our\ntrainers used to say this all the time\nhe said a good relationship is not 50 50\na good relationship is 100 100 each\nperson just puts in 100 of their half\nand that's it you can only focus on on\nyour half of the situation so again I\nwould I would encourage you to write\nabout it I would encourage you to find\nsomeone safe who you can talk with\num because that is a hard thing in a\nrelationship like when you have a fight\nwith someone or a disagreement you don't\nwant to necessarily break their trust\nand go to like their friends or your\nfamily members and talk bad about them\nso find someone else who you can reach\nout to and and talk about it with\nthere's a couple ways\nno I totally agree with that like\nthat's like a big one that was um asked\nlike throughout the chat but um another\nviewer asks how do you manage anger I've\nsuppressed it for so long for the sake\nof self-preservation\ngood question oh I love I love it\num first thing to think about is anger\nis often a secondary emotion so\num for a lot of people and especially\nmen they've been taught like all of\ntheir emotions are a sign of weakness\nbut anger is acceptable and it sounds\nlike this person's kind of the opposite\nright like they've been suppressing\nanger now anger all emotions serve a\nfunction that's one part of\num observing and being willing to feel\nemotions is to recognize emotion serve a\nfunction so what's the function of anger\nwhen it's honest and just to be clear 95\nof the time angers a secondary emotion\ncovering up other more sensitive\nemotions but five percent of the time\nanger is about protection so if\nsomeone's hurting my child in a very\nsevere way I'm going to feel very angry\nI'm going to run over there and try and\nyou know make them stop hurting my child\nand that's situation anger is a\nfunctional\nresponse that is helpful now the other\n95 of time anger is covering up more\nsensitive emotions like sadness guilt\ngrief\num hurt disappointment and in those\nsituations you want to really explore\nwhat's this anchor about\nresearch shows that I and I I would say\nthis is true that most of the time\nexpressing anger\num like oh people tell you hit a pillow\nuh punch you know punch a pillow hit a\ngo go do some punching or go to one of\nthose like anger rooms where you break\nTVs and stuff\num\nresearch shows that's not really that\neffective usually and I think that's\nbecause a lot of times anger is about\nsomething else so check yourself what's\nthis anger about is there an action you\nneed to take to create safety\nand if not like is there a boundary you\nneed to set are you angry because your\nboss is taking advantage of you then you\nneed to like that anger serves a\nfunction and you need to create that\nboundary to create safety\num the rest of the time though maybe\nyou're feeling angry because you're\nactually guilty and\num you're feeling guilty about something\nyou did and you need to fix that or\nmaybe you're feeling angry because\nyou're really really sad and you don't\nlike feeling sad so instead you get\nangry at\nsomeone else to cover up that feeling\nand so as you process emotions explore\nlike what's underneath this anger now\nevery once in a while anger really is is\nvalid and I'm not saying ignore the\nanger suppress the anger or make it go\naway but I'm saying like spend a minute\nwith it get really curious mindfulness\nhas a tool called\num The Beginner's mind and and you\npretend like anger is the planet Mars\nand you are the first person to ever\nwalk on that feeling you say huh I'm so\ncurious get really curious about anger\nwhat does it feel like to be angry where\ndo I feel this anger in my body what\nwhat what kind of thoughts do I have\nwhen I'm angry and this is hard because\nwhen you're really angry your front your\nthinking part of your brain turns off so\nthis is asking you to kind of pendulate\nback to to the thinking part of your\nbrain and swing into that and and\nexplore those thoughts so I would say\nthat's the next thing I would say to get\nreally curious about anger what is it\nwas it like and as you lean into that it\nmight give you more opportunities to\nexplore what it's about and to work\nthrough it see what action this is\nasking you to take or what problem it's\nasking you to solve health or if you're\nthinking around this situation is really\ndistorted that's making you angry like\nif you think everyone's out to get me or\nlife is so unfair that kind of thinking\nis gonna make you feel angry when maybe\nyou're actually quite safe or you're\ndistorting the problem\nthat is a really like how do I answer\nthis this question in two minutes and\nit's like oh you could spend a couple\nhours on this question right yeah a lot\nof questions on anger and Sylvia just\nasked a very uh she has two very\ninteresting questions she asked um how\ndo you process jealousy or the so-called\nbad emotions in a healthy way and she\nasked um are there is there such thing\nas bad emotions are they just socially\nlabeled that way good question\num okay I personally do not believe\nthere are negative and positive emotions\nI believe every emotion serves a\nfunction when it's being really honest\nbut often we create distorted emotions\nby thinking in um the best way I can say\nis an exaggeration or a life like a\ncognitive distortion might make us feel\na um so-called negative emotion more\noften than is valid so like I said with\nanger right if I'm running around\nthinking everyone's out to get me life\nis so unfair the person that McDonald's\ndidn't give me ice cream not because the\nmachine wasn't broken but because they\nhate me or my eyebrows are too thick or\nwhatever it is right like if you're\nhaving this kind of running dialogue in\nyour head\nyou're gonna interpret a situation\nfalsely and that's going to lead to\nintense emotions that aren't as helpful\nat living the life you value so I don't\nask the question oh is it a negative\nemotion is it bad to feel this way I ask\nis this emotion\nhelping me act in a way that lines up\nwith my values\nand if that emotion is not helping me\nact in a way that's lining up with my\nvalues then I'm going to choose to work\nthrough and process that emotion or\nnotice that emotion and accept that\nemotion and choose to shift my focus to\nsomething more helpful so instead of\nusing words like positive and negative\nor good and bad or right and wrong\nemotions I use words like comfortable\nand uncomfortable\nhelpful and unhelpful or accurate\nand distorted those are the kinds of\nwords I use to describe emotions so\njealousy let's take jealousy\num does jealousy usually help you act in\na way\nthat lines up with the kind of person\nyou want to be\ndoes jealousy usually help you build a\nhealthy relationship that's really\npositively oriented toward happiness and\ngrowth and love and support and\ncommitment\num I can think of a couple situations\nwhere jealousy might be helpful right\nlike a committed relationship usually\ninvolves excluding other people from\nthat relationship so in that way like\njealousy can motivate us to say I will\nnot accept an open relationship for\nexample I'll only accept a committed\nrelationship and that way jealousy can\nbe helpful now jealousy can get really\ndistorted when we think oh you know my\nguy can't look at anyone else or else\nI'm gonna blow up and scream and yell at\nhim like that's probably not going to\nlead to\na really healthy relationship so how\nwould I process jealousy I would ask\nwhat's the core that you really want\nlike what do you want in a relationship\nwhat does it look like and then I would\nsay what kind of actions lead toward\nthat relationship and I would kind of\ndisregard the emotion as a motivation I\nwould say okay I'm going to notice that\nI'm going to notice that I'm feeling\njealous I'm going to notice that I'm\nhaving intense emotions I'm going to\ndescribe it I'm going to get curious\nabout it I'm going to pretend like it's\nMars and I've never felt it before and\nthen I'm going to say what do I want and\nI'm going to clarify my values in that\nrelationship and choose action that\nlines up with those values\nso in some ways jealousy can be healthy\nif you're like setting boundaries or\nlike communicating those boundaries in a\nhealthy way yeah yeah like so let's say\nlike you're you're dating a guy and you\num are you you want to be exclusive\nmaybe you haven't clarified that and you\nsee him like spending time with someone\nelse in a way that you're not\ncomfortable with jealousy might motivate\nyou emotions are about motivation they\nask us a question and they ask us what\nare you going to do about things so it\nmight motivate you to clarify that\nrelationship say look I'm only going to\nbe in a relationship with you if we're\nexclusive from now on and if you change\nthat if you choose to not be exclusive\nthen I'm going to choose not to be in a\nrelationship with you yeah right yeah I\ntotally agree with that that's like a\ngood way of putting it and then this is\nthe last question so how do you support\nsomeone who's experiencing grief\num\nsuch a good question and that's a hard\nquestion\num and I think I'm learning more and\nmore that grief is a universal\nexperience that most of us have gotten\nlike no education on that's what I'm\nlearning like I've made a couple videos\non Grief and they've just had tons of\npeople watch them because I think a lot\nof people are really struggling with\nthis so it's it's normal okay so grief\num educating yourself as much as\npossible the first thing I want to say\nand I don't want this to be like a like\na Shameless promotion but I just worked\nwith a Greek grief expert to make a\ncouple of courses on Grief because there\nneeds to be education about it so the\nfirst thing I would say is like learn\nabout it and learn that you can\nexperience grief in all kinds of\nsituations you can grieve a like a\ndivorce you can grieve the loss of a pet\nyou can grieve the loss of a job or a\nfuture or even your past that maybe you\nlost to depression or anxiety so grief\nis normal grief is the internal\nemotional experience and mourning is the\nexternal experience and so how can you\nsupport someone who's grieving I the\nfirst thing I would say is be willing to\nask them about it\nsay would you like to talk about what\nyou're going through it's okay if you\ndon't if you just want to sit hang out\ndo something fun but if you want to talk\nabout it I'm here for you and don't just\nsay like oh you know let me know if\nthere's something you need ask them\nspecifically can I make you dinner can I\ncome over and sit with you can I do XYZ\nfor you and like propose something\nspecific I think people worry a lot\nabout doing the wrong thing or saying\nthe wrong thing but I think people who\nare grieving um\nactually wish people wouldn't tiptoe\naround them as much and would just ask\nthem you don't have to say hey tell me\nabout what what's going on for you I\nmean obviously there's a lot of things\nnot to say like oh have you gotten over\nit yet hey like if someone like lost\ntheir husband\num if their husband died hey when are\nyou gonna start dating are you over it\nyet you know things like that like\nthat's not super helpful but asking an\nopen-ended question like or asking a\nquestion like hey would you like to talk\nabout what's going on for you\num offering to spend time with them can\nbe helpful the other thing I would say\nis like acknowledge that grief isn't\nsomething people get over in a week or a\ncouple of weeks or a couple of months\nlike the grief process for really big\nlosses is often\na year or more or longer like there's no\ntime frame on this right and so I would\nalso say ask them how they're doing\nthree months from now ask them how\nthey're doing four months from now ask\nthem how they're doing five months from\nnow and and develop the skills yourself\nto be a good listener so like again like\nI said previously like empathic\nlistening like learning how to listen\nwithout needing to give advice or talk\nabout yourself or ask a ton of questions\nis a really valuable skill\num and increasing your emotional\num\ntolerance like I use this phrase all the\ntime A lot of times people like their\ngoal is I just want to get feeling\nbetter I just want to feel happy I just\nwant to feel good and I would say what\nif instead you get really good at\nfeeling what if you get really good at\nhandling like feeling anxiety or sadness\nor grief so that when you feel those\nthings it doesn't bother you anymore\nit's like strengthening your muscles\ninstead of taking off your backpack\nbecause feeling is part of living and\ngrieving is part of loving so if you\nwant to help someone grieve I would say\nlike develop the skills\nto feel feelings and make that rule that\nit's okay like it's okay to feel sad\nit's okay to cry with someone it's okay\nto be distraught for a little while\nand um that's like a framework shift\nmore than just like oh here's the here's\nthe thing to say so I hope that's\nhelpful of course absolutely and I\nactually\num wanted to say that the misconception\nsometimes is that everyone experiences\ngrief the same way and that's not true\nat all like it's different for everyone\nhonestly totally totally and some people\nlike want to talk about and hug and cry\nand be around a ton of people and some\npeople want to just like listen to sad\nsongs and like look at pictures and\nthat's part of their process and that's\nokay and some people just want to go for\na hike or work on their car right like\nexactly a lot of different ways to\nprocess emotions\nwell thank you so much Emma thank you\nfor answering all these
