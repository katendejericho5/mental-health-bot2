Knock.\n- Who's there?\n- Wendy.\n- Wendy, who?\n- Wendy you think we can go on a date?\n- [Narrator] A bit too cheesy?\nWell, the good news is even\nsimple jokes can do the trick.\nA most trusted icebreaker, so to speak.\nA 2015 research article published\nan evolutionary psychology\nfound that humor points\nto having a sociable and\nagreeable personality.\nThe study also found that\nwhen a pair laughed together,\nthey were more interested in each other.\nBut why is that?\nHumor eases the situation.\nIt makes you seem more open and likable.\nThis trick is also backed by science.\nLaughing releases endorphins\nwhich make you feel good\nabout yourself and others.\nOn top of that,\nyour crush could follow\nup with their own joke.\nAnd if you laugh at it,\nyou get bonus points.\nPeople tend to like others\nwho laugh at their jokes.\nEven if it doesn't work,\nit does show others your\nfun, loving and brave side.\nSo don't be nervous to\ndrop a joke here or there.\nNumber two, remember to say thank you.\nSaying thank you is not\nonly a sign of good manners,\nit's also a simple way to\ntell someone I appreciate you.\nAs Antonio Damasia, a professor\nof psychology and urology\nput it, \"Gratitude rewards generosity\nand maintains the cycle of\nhealthy social behavior.\"\nShowing gratitude makes people\nfeel respected and happy\nand it lets them know you\nrecognize their efforts.\nIf you are hanging out with your crush,\ntell them, \"Thank you\nfor such a good time!\"\nOr if they're a good friend\nwho never feels to listen,\ntell them, \"Thank you for\nalways being there for me!\"\nThis simple but powerful phrase\ncould create a long lasting\nbond between you two.\nThree, share a little secret.\nIt is no secret that\neveryone can have a secret.\nSome are small, like\nthat embarrassing thing\nyou did in middle school,\nand some are bigger\nlike the drama that goes on in the family.\nYeah, you could be someone\nwho likes to keep them\nto yourself, and that's okay.\nSometimes sharing some\nof your little secrets\nwith your crush could make\nthem like you a bit more.\nSharing a secret with someone\ncreates a bond between you\nand it takes your relationship\nto the next level.\nMaking it more special and intimate.\nThis is something that's been known\nto researchers for decades.\nResearch that goes back as far as 1994\nhas shown that people who\nuse more intimate disclosure\ntend to create a meaningful\nbond with their special someone.\nLong story short, telling\nyour crush a little secret\nabout yourself might just be a good way\nto get the ball rolling.\nNumber four, give them compliments.\nThey say compliments are verbal sunshine.\nWhat do you think?\n\"You look lovely today.\"\n\"You have an awesome style.\"\n\"That hair-do looks great on you.\"\nEveryone likes to receive such compliments\nfrom time to time.\nIt's perfectly normal and\nit boosts your self-esteem.\nCompliments can make your crush\nfeel like they're really special to you.\nYou seem like someone\nwho cares about them,\nbut the words you choose for\nyour compliments matter too.\nA 2017 research study published\nin Frontiers in Psychology\nfound that women tend to like men\nwho compliment using more\nmetaphorical language,\nwhich shows their creativity.\nIt's also worth noting\nto compliment things\nthat they don't hear all that often.\nFor example, compliment\ntheir artistic skills\nor a good book choice.\nThey'll surely be glad someone noticed\nand it could be a great\nconversation starter.\nAnd number five, ask them questions.\nHmm, to ask or not to ask?\nAsking simple everyday\nquestions to begin with\nis a way of showing them\nthat you're interested.\nAsk them about their hobbies\nor their bucket list or\ntheir favorite music choice.\nPretty much anything.\nThis can make your crush like you.\nYeah, for reals.\nA 2017 Harvard study found a connection\nbetween asking questions and being liked.\nTalking about them, asking\nthem about their life\ncould be a good strategy\nto increase your chances.\nSo just ask away.\nLet them do the talking\nand see how they smile more\nevery time they see you.\nIn addition, the golden\nrule is to just relax,\ntake it easy, and be honest,\nand genuine while talking to them.\nThey'll surely feel the positive vibes\nand don't forget to let\nus know how it went.\nAre you ready to try these out?\nAre there any tips we missed?\nFeel free to leave a comment\nwith your experience,\nfeedback, or suggestions.\nIf you find this video helpful,\nbe sure to hit the like button\nand share it with others too.\nDon't forget to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more new videos.\nThanks for watching."
