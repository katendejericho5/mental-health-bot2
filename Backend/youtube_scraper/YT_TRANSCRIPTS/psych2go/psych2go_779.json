    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Is beauty only skin deep?\nThere might not be a universal\nanswer to this question,\nbut research in psychology clearly shows\nthat it's not just a beautiful face\nthat makes us attractive.\nOur personality, behavior, attitudes,\nthey all create a constellation of traits\nthat influence how others see us.\nBut no matter if you're\nas pretty as a picture,\nsome not so pretty habits\ncould make people look away.\nWhat are those habits\nthat might make you seem unattractive?\nKeep watching to find out.\n\"I'll go next time.\"\nSome days you just don't\nfeel like being social.\nLike, at all.\nYour co-workers or school friends\ninvite you to hang out\nand you come up with\nan excuse and run home.\nMaybe the introvert in you\nis having an extra hard day,\nor you just wanna watch\nNetflix by yourself.\nAnd that's totally fine.\nBut what if it happens too often?\nSocial psychology suggests\nthat avoiding spending time with others\nis not a good strategy if\nyou'd like to be attractive.\nAccording to the mere-exposure effect,\nwe tend to prefer things we see often.\nIn a classic 1992 experiment,\nstudents who attended class more often\nwere more liked by their colleagues\nsimply because they were seen more often.\nThere's also the principle\nof proximity liking.\nIt means that we tend\nto become fond of others\nwhen we have repeated contact with them.\nA 2008 research study published\nin Psychological Science\nfound that students who sit\nnext to each other in class\nare more likely to become friends.\nBottom line, don't reject that coffee\nnext time you're invited.\n\"Look at me!\"\nBeing confident is certainly\nsomething to strive for,\nbut being overly confident,\nmaybe not so much.\nPsychotherapist Richard\nJoelson said in an article\nfor Psychology Today\nthat we tend to think of\npeople who boast as arrogant,\nself-preoccupied, or even insecure.\nSo if you can't stop talking\nabout your achievements or success,\nyou may unintentionally come\noff as full of yourself.\nA 2014 study published in the\nJournal of Positive Psychology\nhad two groups of people read descriptions\nof hypothetical students.\nSome descriptions were\nconfident, but humble.\nFor example, \"I'm a pretty good student,\nbut not a bookworm.\"\nOther people say, \"I'm smart,\nbut I don't like the attention.\"\nAnd others shown a bit of a boasting vibe.\n\"I'm really good student and pretty smart,\nbut definitely not a nerd or bookworm.\nI guess it just comes naturally.\"\nLater in the experiment,\nparticipants showed greater interest\nin starting a relationship with students\nwhose descriptions appeared more humble.\nSo make sure you don't brag\ntoo much in front of others.\nIt may sound just a bit off putting.\n2 AM Club.\nIs your nighttime routine\nconsist of scrolling\nthrough TikTok or watching\nYouTube videos until 2 AM,\nthen trying to silently make popcorn\nfollowed by a few episodes\nof your favorite show?\nIf this sounds like you,\nyou should maybe rethink this habit.\nResearch published in\nthe journal BMJ in 2010\ninvestigated the attractiveness\nof sleep deprived individuals.\nThe researchers took photos\nof two groups of people:\nthose who'd slept for eight\nhours the night before\nand the sleep-deprived one\nwho hadn't slept in 31 hours.\nParticipants of the study\nthen had to rate those photos.\nAs expected, they rated\nthe sleep-deprived people\nas looking less healthy\nand less attractive.\nIt seems like skimping on\nsleep won't get you that date.\nGlass half empty.\nWe all get sucked into\na state of pessimism\nfrom time to time.\nTalking about how you feel\ncan make you feel relieved in a way.\nBut, is this habit viewed as attractive?\nWell, not so much.\nIn 2007, German researchers\ndeveloped a study\nin which they had participants listened\nto some tape recorded conversations.\nThe tapes had optimistic, realistic,\nand pessimistic people talking about\nhow they were dealing\nwith stressful situations.\nAfter listening, participants\nfilled out a questionnaire\nin which they evaluated the personality\nand attractiveness of the\npeople they listened to.\nThe results showed that if\nthey listened to optimistic\nand realistic people,\nthey viewed them much more\nfavorably than pessimistic ones.\nSo even if you're not the most optimistic\nand cheerful person,\nlanding a balance between black and white\nby being at least realistic\ncould make you seem more attractive\nthan simply indulging in negativity.\nNon-pickup lines.\nIs it sexy to be sexist?\nAnd this is how researchers\nnamed their 2020 study\npublished in The Journal\nof Personal Relationships.\nAnd the answer, it's a clear no.\nThe study showed that sexist humor,\nwhen directed to the opposite gender,\ncomes off as unattractive\nand even aggressive.\nEven if you don't mean it in a bad way,\njoking about gender\nstereotypes or gender roles\ncan make the other person\nroll their eyes, cringe,\nand try to get as far\naway from you as possible.\nThat doesn't mean you\nshouldn't ever joke, of course.\nJust make sure your jokes are tasteful\nand not hurting any group of people.\nDo you recognize some of\nthese behaviors in yourself?\nIf you do, don't worry.\nEvery day is a new\nopportunity to learn and grow.\nChanging some unattractive\nand unhealthy habits\nmight draw others towards you.\nBut most importantly,\nit would make you feel\ngreat in your own skin.\nYou can check out older videos\nto learn about 10 surprising habits\nthat make you more attractive.\nAnd remember, no matter what,\npsych thinks you're a real treat.\nAnd don't ever forget,\nyou matter."
