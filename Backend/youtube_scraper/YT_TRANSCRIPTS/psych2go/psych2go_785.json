    "video_title": "United Nations Association of Canada: Tackling Barriers to Psychiatric and Neurological Care",
    "transcript": "hi what are the pressing barriers\ntowards accessing neurological and\npsychiatric care today\nI would like to tackle this question\nwith youth and Community lenses in mind\nI'm Monica and I am a graduate of\nNeuroscience and a current medical\nstudent\ntoday with me is a very very special\nguest Community liaison kimberlyang from\nthe United Nations Association of Canada\ntogether in the next 30 to 35 minutes we\nwant to create a healthier\nmore inclusive community for reaching\nmental health and neurological care and\nwe invite you to be a part of this\nconversation\nwelcome Kimberly\nthanks Monica it's very very wonderful\nto meet all of you and to see all of you\nand I'm very excited for today\nme as well I realize this is such a\ncomplex question and we're going to try\nto tackle everything with an equity and\nyouth kind of perspective in mind but\nthis is really just the beginning so the\nhope is really just to provide you\nresources and post some solutions but by\nno means is this you know comprehensive\nbut just a starting point\nso for everyone just joining us today we\nreally hope that this is unlike other\nkind of workshops more interactive so we\ninvite you to leave your thoughts or\ncomments as well\nand with that so let's just dive in I\nfirst like to really invite you to even\ncomment what does equity mean to you\nand especially Health Equity\num we'll just give a few moments for\neveryone to\ntake some time to type it in and then\nperhaps I can start with my kind of\ninterpretation of it and maybe you could\nlet me know some of your thoughts as\nwell Kim yeah for sure\nso I think when people think about\nHealth Equity it's being able to have\naccess to Services when they need it\nmost\num and this is really in contrast to\nthings like you know Health equality and\nyeah there's a really big difference so\none way that I like to always explain it\nis that you know there's this image of\nwhere let's say there's there's like a\nfootball gaming going on that's\nhappening and you are a spectator you\nreally want to watch but unfortunately\nbetween the game and between you there\nis this large and tall fence that you're\nnot able to see\nso if you're going to be providing an\nequity lens versus an equality lens this\nis the difference\nequality would mean that you're going to\nbe providing everybody no matter their\nheight the person beside you might be so\nmuch shorter the person behind you\nbehind you must might be I don't know I\ndon't know like three feet the same size\nstool\nso you're going to give that to everyone\nand just hope that the short baby could\nsee over the fence versus Equity where\nyou might be then giving different\naccommodations to meet people's\ndifferent needs\nand so\nfor the baby you might be giving them\nlike a really really tall chair for the\nrelease tall six foot adults maybe they\ndon't need any chairs and they'll be\nable to give that resource to someone\nelse and so that's kind of the idea of\nequity versus equality and when we apply\nthat to health care we can really kind\nof adjust ways for people to access care\nfor people to then make use of it and\nthen feel comfortable and then trust the\nsystem so that's kind of my\ninterpretation of it and it's really\njust the beginning because we want\nreally want to take that kind of\nmetaphor and eventually dismantle those\nthose fences that prevent people from\naccessing care in the first place so\nyeah definitely really complicated\nproblem that needs complicated Solutions\nbut that's my thoughts what about yours\nyeah no absolutely I think you put it\ninto great words and kind of visualized\nit in a great way as well\num but and I would agree for sure that\nin many senses quality kind of assumes\nthat everyone you know everybody is the\nsame and that we all need the same\nthings but with equity and reality a lot\nof the times is there are some people\nthat start with maybe less some people\nthat start with more and so we need very\nvery different things in order to get to\nthe same place and I would say even\nmaybe some are in school at the moment\nuh and I would say covet definitely has\nreally kind of\num I guess highlighted this issue of\nneeding to emphasize Equity maybe\num let's say a school gives a computer\nto every student because they need to go\nto school online but then there are a\nlot of maybe households that might not\neven have proper access to Wi-Fi and if\nthose things aren't provided even if you\ngive the computers everyone gets a\ncomputer\nsome people might not even be able to\nuse it or they don't have enough in\norder to be able to do school online so\nI would say it's definitely important\nthat we kind of keep these things in\nmind and realize that there is a\ndifference not that you know maybe one\nis better than the other but I think\nEquity especially is something we have\nto kind of start to consider and you're\nright it's a it's a big\ntopic that requires a lot and there's a\nlot of things that need to be considered\nwhen tackling it but yeah\nfor sure and you're already like kind of\nmentioning some some barriers to being\nable to access care like in the case of\nusing a laptop even for things like I\ndon't know e-consultations some people\nmight not have internet to be able to\naccess that and if we really go down to\nthe basics of it some people not might\nnot be able to understand how to use it\nfor whatever reason you know just as an\nexample people struggling with\nneurological disorders might not be able\nto understand what they're reading\num so it's really important to keep that\nin mind and I think with that we could\nalso touch upon other possible barriers\nthat people might experience and then go\nfrom there post some solutions so\nyeah what are your thoughts um for the\ncommunity as well to those who are\nwatching post some some barriers that\nyou might have experienced yourself\num things that you might feel\ncomfortable sharing and we'll have a\ndiscussion about that as well\num I mean just to start I think\nunaccessable Services is really one\nthing that stands out to me I think\nthere's just there's a lot of things out\nthere and for whatever reason some\npeople might not be able to know about\nit\num some people may not be able to reach\nit I know just in the medical curriculum\nalone we always emphasize The Importance\nof Being able for to have people access\nthings people might be living two hours\naway from their nearest GP and yeah\nthat's a really big problem\nyeah absolutely agree there's so so many\nbarriers it's definitely I think\num difficult to kind of be able to\ntackle all of them but yeah like you\nsaid there's a lot of like geographical\nI guess barriers there might be I guess\njust the incredibly long wait times\nthere are a lot of costs and economic\nbarriers involved so it's difficult\nthere are even you know maybe language\nor cultural barriers that people face\nI've got lots of personal stories over\nthere as well so there are a lot of\nbarriers unfortunately\num but that's how it is\nyeah it's definitely very unfortunate\nbut I think that there are things that\ncould be done and\num like a theme of this Workshop this\ninteractive presentation I think is to\nhighlight how digital Technologies could\nhelp bridge the gap between people who\nare unable to access it to giving more\npeople the opportunity to do so I mean\njust to answer some people who are\ncommenting in the uh box people are\nsaying there's regarding to what I think\nfairies in regarding to accessing care\nso just someone has posted right now\num I need mental health care but I am\nconfused and that's exactly a barrier in\nof itself how do we even begin to\nnavigate the system let's say someone's\nlike oh I'm experiencing distressing\nsymptoms of anxiety just as an example\nwhere do you begin with that information\nright\num\nso I think being able to come up with a\nkind of Step care model which is what\nI'll talk about later in the solutions\num knowing the entry point to things is\ndefinitely one thing we can can talk\nabout but you mentioned other barriers\nand perhaps we could talk more in depth\nabout that if you feel comfortable to\nother people as well who just shared\nsome kind of\nbeginnings of like confusion and things\nlike that yeah share some more if you if\nyou'd like and we can further explore\nthat\num\nyeah even I'm like noticing I mean a\nprime example someone mentioned that\nthere are a lot of I guess they have\ntransportation barriers where they have\nto travel long distances in order to you\nknow even attend these appointments\num and it's it's difficult I would say\nit's definitely difficult\num but but like you said if we can\nperhaps even start to think about using\nI guess like digital tools and digital\nresources to make things a bit more\nconvenient in terms of maybe booking\nappointments or being able to I guess\nlike gain resources online to kind of\nassist us\num when we we need when we need it so\nyeah that's I would say a prime example\nyeah and just uh like another thing is\noh my goodness like the long wait times\nare just absolutely mad so I think uh\nbefore I share an example there are so\nmany ways that technology e-medicine can\nbe used to ameliorate that because just\nfrom my personal experience like two\nweeks ago I had this really really bad\ncough and it lasted since Christmas Eve\nand it was already into 2023 so I was\nlike oh my goodness I've had a cough for\nlike a year now that's that's mad and I\nwas like calling up\num the the university like yeah what is\nit called like Health lines or whatever\nand uh I never got through so I was like\noh no and then when I did\num it was full for the day so I was like\noh call back tomorrow did that again\nsame sort of thing So eventually I had\nto like drive two hours to find us to\nfind a place but yeah that's just like a\npersonal example of how how you know\nlong wait times could actually just\nand they disabled me from getting care\nat all and eventually you know it just\nwent away by itself but it's not like\nthe situation I mean it's not like\nthis is not everyone's lucky enough to\njust have whatever go away by themselves\nwhatever they're experiencing so\nyeah that's a personal example\nyeah people are commenting here to my\nuniversity provides lots of resources\nbut the wait time is four weeks and yeah\nyou're not alone in that a lot of people\nare experiencing\num that as well especially in uni\ncampuses\nuh college campuses even high schools I\nwould say\num let's see if anyone else has any\nthoughts to barriers\nwe could\ndo that we could do chatting I think\nLanguage and Cultural Bears is\ndefinitely one as well yes absolutely it\ndefinitely is I mean I have a few I\nwould say even personal experiences\nregarding that where it's just you know\nmaybe for example my parents there was\nlike an instance where\nlike I guess maybe they had a fault or\nmaybe something health related occurred\nand so you know we would suggest to them\noh maybe we should definitely check this\nup but there were a lot of I guess\nperhaps even stigmas related to you know\noh do we really need I guess to access\nhealth care is this really a necessity\num and so then as a result in the end we\nnever went to go check it out and I\nwould say these are just even cultural\nbarriers that some people might face\nwhere perhaps there is the stigma\nrelated to like just even gaining access\nto health care whether it be physical\nwhether it be perhaps even like a mental\nhealth so it's definitely that's even\njust one barrier that I'm sure a lot of\npeople face I know someone in the chat\neven said\num that I guess their parents didn't\nreally encourage them to I guess or they\ndon't even know much about mental health\nand so then as consequence there wasn't\nreally much that I guess maybe people in\nthe chat could do about it in terms of\nbeing able to research more or be able\nto get more access to Mental Health\nResources because there's I guess like\nthis barrier perhaps culturally perhaps\nwithin like family so\nyou know there's there is there are\ndefinitely barriers there as well\nyeah so we've mentioned so many\ndifferent kind of barriers you mentioned\nlike you like we just chatted about\nlanguage cultural barriers you mentioned\ncosts some people mentioned unaccessible\nServices due to confusion of the system\nuh what other things just to really\nsummarize\num geograph Geographic or demographic\nbarriers\num not knowing where to go uh we'll just\ntake 20 seconds just really summarize\nall the other barriers if I'm just going\nthrough it to see\num cultural barriers economic barriers\nexactly especially for neurodivergent\nfolks and those with executive\nfunctioning issues definitely\num so yeah with those I think you know\nthis is not a one-size-fits-all solution\nbut I'll try to at this point of the\nlive stream host some solutions based on\nResearch that I found in the past weeks\nand summarize everything and to those\nwho are also Keen to interact just\nthrough chat Kimberly will be able to be\nthere and uh respond to those and I'll\njust go through some of the things that\nI had in mind\nso I think yeah\nwe're just gonna dive in the the idea is\nthat because there's so much that people\nneed and that there's not enough\nresources out there\num there's this idea of like a step care\nmodel I don't know if you guys have\nheard of what step care means but\nessentially it's just delivering\ntreatment whereby you start from the\nleast resource intensive\ntreatments and then you work your way up\nlet's say from you can think of it like\na staircase so step one might be\nsomething like\num self-education searching for\ninformation\nstep two if that doesn't work really\nwell would be kind of looking towards\nmore\num\nMaybe\nuh pure peer support things like that if\nthat doesn't work then you go up to find\na Community Resources if that doesn't\nwork then you go towards finding like\nespecially Specialty Care and try to\naccess that\num so the structure of this part of the\nworkshop will really just be from\nstarting from Step One words\nOkay so\nthe first step that people often refer\nto in the literature is informational\nself-directed as the name suggests it's\nself-directed but there are barriers in\nthat too like where do we begin to look\nso I'm going to now highlight a couple\nresources and I'll put them in the chat\nafter in the link in the description box\nuh I think the first kind of really\nimportant thing is just to understand\nwhen there's signs of distress or\ndiscomfort or anything affects your\nquality of life is to understand what is\ngoing on like what is this thing that I\nam experiencing\nsometimes there might not even be a name\nto it but in most cases there will so\nNHS the national healthcare service\num based in England is a wonderful\nwebsite to be able to access\nthese informational things so for\nexample let's say that you are\nexperiencing or a friend or is\nexperiencing symptoms of\ngeneral anxiety disorder so go to you\nwould literally go to just type in\nGoogle type in\nNHS generalized anxiety disorder and\nthere would be a web page and uh oops it\nis giving me a\nyeah it's giving me a page now overview\ngeneralized anxiety disorders in adults\nit will give you a summary it tells you\nsymptoms where to get when to get help\nfor it what causes it who's affected so\nvery very\nclear concise\ninformation about what this disorder is\nand so that's one of my actual favorite\nresources it's go-to it's very easy to\ncomprehend so I think that's definitely\nthe pros of it\num I would say the cons well it's quite\nwell it's just like an academic kind of\nlike not quite academic but it's quite\nlike a this is the facts right so you\ndon't really know much about what it's\nlike to experience it if you're just a\nfriend perhaps who has not experienced\nit yet so yeah it's just quite objective\num and it's UK based so the next\nresource that you might be interested to\nknow about is called kids help phone and\nas the previous a previous member of\nkids helpful is nationally youth Council\nI think yeah it's I mean I'm biased in\nthat but I think it's such an amazing\nresource so you have information about\njust any sort of Mental Health Challenge\nthat you might be experiencing there's\nopportunities to actually connect with\ntrained counselors\nand\nget the support whatever you need so\nit's absolutely amazing\num I would also recommend the\ncdc.gov that is also another website\nwhere you can get information just like\nthe NHS about any sort of\num\ndisorder condition\nthings that might weren't Attention\nmedical treatment\num the next one I have here is\nclevelandclinic.org it is\nit is like it is a medical school it's\num also just a really great resource to\naccess any sort of information you might\nneed\nmedlineplus.gov as well\nthat is also a good website to get\ninformation so these are all\ninformational things that I'm going to\nshare that I am sharing and lastly this\nis one that I've actually personally use\nas a kid growing up it's called\nkidshealth.org it is so kid friendly\nexplains any sort of thing that you\nmight be curious about and uh just is\nreally great in terms of getting\ninformation so those are my suggestions\non kind of where to go in terms of\nany sort of things that you might have\nquestions about\nand Kimberly if you ever have any thing\nyou like to add as well just feel free\nto jump in I know the chat is pretty\nbusy but just one yeah no thank you\nabsolutely I think honestly it's just\nreally inspiring to be able to kind of\nsee that there are these resources that\nyou've laid out that we can you know\naccess when we need them and I think for\na lot of people here that perhaps are\nstruggling a bit or maybe are feeling a\nlittle bit anxious or they're you know\nthings that are overwhelming in their\nlife and they perhaps maybe want more\nresources to kind of help them get\nthrough these difficult times it's great\nthat there are things out there and that\nthere are these maybe websites and these\nlike I guess digital tools and platforms\nthat we can really kind of look back to\nand rely on to kind of help us a little\nbit or kind of guide us and give us an\nidea of you know what are things we\nshould be looking out for what are next\nsteps we should take you know if we need\nsomeone to talk to so no I think it's\ngreat so thank you for sharing those so\nfar Monica yeah of course yeah speaking\nabout next steps I'll dive into step two\nbefore I do so I just wanted to\nhighlight some comments that people\nshared and yeah just to really Echo the\nfact that those are great websites again\nI'll post them in the description box uh\nkids health is great Mayo Clinic\nmedlineplus Cleveland Clinic CDC kids\nhelpful in NHS\nand yeah\nthis question here are there free online\nchat resources this is exactly what\nwe're going to be chatting about now so\nlet's say that resource banks have been\nhelpful but you want a little bit more\nsupport this is part of step two of the\nstep care model and\nuh yeah there are a couple of resources\nthat people can have access to that are\nfree uh one of them includes literally\nas I mentioned the kids helpful online\njust call in text in and people will be\nable to access support in Canada\nwhenever they need it and buy someone\nwho is trained so that's one of my\nfavorite resources I reached out that's\nwhen I was a kid just about like\nanything like there's nothing too big\nthere's nothing too small I think once I\nwas just quite frustrated about getting\na grade and like suddenly as little as\nthat people are there to listen people\nare there to help and\nyeah it's just a really great resource\npeople are very very\num compassionate as well so the the\ninformation for that I will just share\nwith everyone\num so kids help phone.ca the\nit should be on the\nyeah it's on the website so kids\nhelpful.ca to get help and connect for\nsupport\nthe next one that I do want to also\nmention are more peer related things so\nseven cups.com is one that I've come\nacross and that I've heard people have\nhad positive responses to essentially\nget matched with a volunteer and they\noffer non-judgmental listening\nthat is I want to mention some of the\nlimitations that you know everyone's\nexperiences are going to be quite\ndifferent and the person on the other\nside they do not know you they don't\nknow your whole story so sometimes the\ninformation that you provide and the\ninformation that the thing that they\nrespond is from what they know of you\nwhich is not very much right so just\nkeep that in mind but always it's good\nto have a listening ear\num in terms of more Community\nfocused things because I do want to\nreally emphasize you know the community\nlens to it in the UK there is the\nmind.org dot UK website whereby you can\nfind information for peer support groups\nand this could be in person so if you're\nhoping to also get together and meet\npeople then talk about whatever you're\nexperiencing sometimes the NHS by\ndifferent regions would have these\navailable to you I've actually attended\nand like been a part of some myself when\nI was there and yeah it's really great\nbecause you get to really get the idea\nthat you know you're not alone in\nwhatever you're experiencing and at the\nend of the day you guys will be able to\nsupport each other and get through\nwhatever you're experiencing\nanother one that I do want to also\nmention is uni level one so at many\nuniversities they have a helpline\navailable\num so when I was in uni the one that we\nhad was called\noxford.nightline.ac.uk This is anonymous\nanonymous listening Service as well and\nsame idea as kids helpful in seven cups\nbut this time it's another student who's\nlistening\num and specifically to the Oxford\nNightline it is kind of based on\num other Oxford students or other Oxford\nbooks as you can tell it's for\nUniversity of Oxford but you might be\nable to check for similar\num\nsimilar kind of things like chat\nresources there and so those are my\nthoughts on the peer self-directed\nsupport\nany further thoughts\nI'm just taking a look\num\nif anyone else has any ideas share it in\nthe chat same with you Kimberly just\nlike hop in whatever\num otherwise I will\nmentioned the next kind of\nstep which is uh then being able to kind\nof find help in the in the form of more\nlike\nI don't know more involved kind of\nthings\num I think books resources like books as\na form of resource as a form of a\nresource I can't speak uh is a really\ngreat one\num my favorite book for neurology just\nto get perspective of what it's like for\nsomeone else perhaps it's called when\nbreath becomes air it is probably one of\nthe most beautiful books I have ever\nread uh essentially it's about a\nneurosurgeon who one day is treating\npatients to then becoming his patient\nhimself and you really get to see how\num he copes with illness he copes with\ncancer\num how he then you know navigates the\nto some how he finds support what he\nvalues and yeah it's just that\nabsolutely beautiful book so I think\nsometimes getting other people's\nexperiences or just seeing how other\npeople cope with things it's also quite\nuseful\nin terms of disorder specific books when\npanic attacks I have that book for\nany sort of general anxiety is a very\nwonderful book I would highly suggest it\num and because my I only really want to\nshare books that I've personally read\num because then I can really vouch for\nthem but I haven't\nI haven't read too much about\ndisorder specific things but yeah when\npanic attacks is definitely one I would\nrecommend and one breath becomes air for\nneuro so those are my thoughts\num if anyone else has any\nbooks that would be that would be useful\num feel free to share it\notherwise now I want to also mention\num in the last bit of the solutions\nFocus part\nwhat does finding care look like\num so finding care it is so difficult\nalready you know like we've emphasized\nthat so many times uh digital kind of\ndigital tools might be able to help you\nyou know understand the disorder more\nthan be able to reach out for peer\nsupport but you know what if you need a\nbit more what if you need\na physician a clinician anyone\nwell there are some online e\nwhat is it called like e Telehealth kind\nof well\nthe healthcare services that are quite\nuseful\num dialogue dot Co that is one that I\nhave also used and one that is\num subsidized I think by the university\nbut there might be similar ones that are\navailable to you or you might actually\nhave access to dialogue I'm not quite\nsure but take a look at that\num\nthat is one way to access care the\nsecond one is to sign up for the GP\nregistry list I know a lot of people do\nnot have a family doctor a GP and I\nthink it is just so important to have a\nprimary contact because before I talk\nabout how to actually access the\nHealthcare System I think\nit's important to emphasize that GPS in\nCanada and UK are the primary like the\nbeginnings of things so if you have\nquestions about like\nneurological care or like psychiatric\ncare you want to be evaluated for any of\nthese things like oftentimes you have to\ngo to your GP first so the link is also\ngoing to be shared in Quebec which is\nwhere it reside there is a website go\nback to RCA type in finding it\nregistering with a family doctor and\nthen sign up it takes like three minutes\nI have done it myself and you wait the\nreality is that it takes a really long\ntime I signed up last year I haven't\nheard back but I think it's just good to\nhave your name there and\nthat's what I have to say about that I\nknow the section is more limited because\nit is more difficult but\num\nyes so in sums so far before I tackle\nactually what it looks like to access\ncare\num we have mentioned a whole bunch of\nresources to really understanding the\nneurological or psychiatric conditions\nwe have then mentioned interactive or\nself-directed peer support things oh I\nforgot to also mention we have a\npsychico Discord which has a peer\nsupport service as well\num the link is just in I'm also just\ngonna post it but uh discord.gg Slash\nlike to go we have a commutative\nindividuals who are there to listen to\nhelp to share and to support\nuh then we mentioned some other\nself-help kind of books that you might\nbe interested in finding uh Goodreads\nwould also have suggestions for more\nwe then mentioned finding care so how\nthis might look like online with\ndialogue with signing up for GP registry\nlists\nand uh yeah how does it look like once\nyou have all this\num you've got yourself an appointment\nhopefully what does it look like right\num so\nyeah there are a couple of barriers\nthere already like just being being able\nto you know understand being able to\nthen attend the appointment or being\nable to attend it online for whatever\nfor whatever reason you know because\npeople might be busy\num\nbut I think throughout all of this whole\nprocess it's important to really kind of\ncritically analyze the information that\nyou're thinking that you're receiving\nbecause there's a lot of information out\nthere and there's also a lot of\nmisinformation so perhaps I want to\nclose in the last like two three minutes\nwith tips on how to really understand\nthe information that you're taking in\nbecause it is so important\num do you have any thoughts let me know\nwhen you whenever you do and to people\nin the chat as well but I will just\nshare first of all always look at the\nsource of what you're reading you know\nwhen people are saying free peer support\ncheck their privacy and their you know\nyeah privacy you know the like the long\npages of things like what I'm gonna do\nwith your information read it actually\nread it\num then yeah look at the Domain is it a\nDOT UV you know something that is\ngovernment\nposted probably supported by evidence\nthe things that they claim where do they\nget it from is it just a random website\nlike I don't know like I eat potatoes\nwhatever.com or is it like an actual\nproper\nresearch paper\nthen it even if it's a research paper\nnot all research papers are of quality\nsome of them are\nless rigorous than others and look at\nthe things that other people post and\nwhat other people say about it\nso yeah Analyze This resource the source\num critically think about the\nmotivations of why the site is posting\nthe information that they are posting if\npeople are telling you that their\ntreatment for like whatever pill is\ndoing great and it's from the\nmanufacturers themselves\nthat's a conflict of interest you know\nso you should take think of the bias the\nrisk of bias as well so yeah the source\nthe people who are posting any others\nKimberly can you think of\num I would say I mean the ones that you\nmentioned are really really important\num so those are something to keep in\nmind but I think even from a more\num I would say this may be like a little\nbit more far out there but I was like\nseeing a few I guess like comments that\nwere really asking from a more I guess\nbird's eye perspective about how to\nreally tackle this like issue I mean\nthere may be I'm one person said they\nwere in Vancouver that there was a big\ndisconnect between like I guess lower\nincome families and access to\npsychiatric help\num that maybe like there are a lot of\npeople who don't own computers or\nsmartphones and they feel that maybe\nlike advocacy is inadequate\num and to those to that I would really\nsay I guess this is an area that I\nreally I guess I'm passionate about but\nabsolutely if you have the capacity\num take the time to I guess you know\nspread more awareness whether it be in\nyour own little bubble if you can to\nyour parents to your family to your\nfriends\num do your best us to kind of really I\nguess like emphasize some of the points\nthat maybe you want to have really\nmentioned about these domains about\nthese resources out there\num make sure if you have the capacity go\nout there and I guess connect with maybe\norganizations or groups that you know\nmight be involved in being able to kind\nof connect and advocate for I guess like\nlower income groups with psychiatric\nhelp there are organizations out there\nthere are tons of them it's really just\na matter of being able to find them and\nsupport them however you can\num but yeah I guess it's just continuing\nto use whatever resources you have and\ntaking whatever steps you can both big\nand small to kind of really make a\ndifference if you have the environment\nand the capacity to do so but that's\njust I guess another tip that is a\nlittle bit out there I don't know if\nthat makes sense though\noh it's it's an amazing tip because it\nreally emphasizes the point that every\nlittle thing matters you might not see\nit you might not see results in one day\none week one month but everything adds\nup and uh just from personal experience\nlike when you look back after you're\nlike wow that was a totally different\nperson\nso yeah I'm in full support of what you\njust said to really Advocate and then to\ntry to connect yourself to these\nsometimes very fragmented resources\nhopefully the resources I provided today\nmight be sort of like a launching pad or\nways to you know help get get help and\nyeah just really acknowledge that at\nthis stage now to be able to be willing\nand able to want to seek help is already\na great achievement because it's already\nso difficult for many to do so\nand uh yeah so I think the last few\nminutes I want to do rapid fire\nquestions so I want this to really meet\nthe needs of everyone who is here so if\nyou have any questions post them I\nalready see some so I'm just trying to\num tackle as many as I can Kimberly will\nalso try to tackle them through the chat\nand yeah let's go so Heather has asked\nhow do I get diagnosed with depression\nanxiety or anything like that\num this is first I want to say caveat it\nreally depends on the place the location\nthat you are in but I'm gonna basically\nanswer this\num from my experience being in Canada\nand the UK and my understanding of the\nsystem so in Canada in the UK you would\nneed to\ngo to a GP first or you need to find\nyourself a psychiatrist but to be able\nto get to a psychiatrist you need a GP\nright\num so you would need to go to GP first\num how this could look like is that if\nyou're in Canada dialogue.com is a\nservice that provides GP I've seen GPS\nfrom that website\num because I know it's not easy to get\none in the UK I think the system's\num when I was there it's it's not too\nbad in terms of getting a GP especially\nif you're in uni\num in my case we were given a GP\num just because it was attached to the\ncollege so you just need to search your\nUniversity talk to the person in your\nUniversity and just say hi I really want\nto get assessed for anxiety depression\nwhatever\num finishing might be\num curious to explore and then you get\nconnected to a GP usually a time frame\nfor that sort of thing for a GP maybe\none week or so in the UK a bit\ndefinitely longer in Canada but yeah\ndepending on province\nand yeah that's where I would go from\nthere\nso hopefully that's helpful\num this is just to highlight a very good\nexperience from someone else who has\nalso\num said that if you've been diagnosed\nwith neurological issues then um not\nreputable organizations may have free\nhealth care for help National registered\nCharities absolutely that is a very good\nresource as well\num\nexactly checking resources is very\nimportant\nchecking the sources\nlet me see\nokay uh how effective does gym for Curie\nmental diseases in your opinion uh first\nI'm not a physician uh\nbut I would say there is just so much\nevidence behind the effectiveness of\nexercise for mental well-being\num just being able to get air being able\nto get more oxygen in your brain has\nreally great benefits in terms of curing\nmental diseases though\num it's really dependent on so many\ndifferent things like mental diseases is\na huge huge\nhuge field are we talking anxiety are we\ntalking you know neurological like you\nknow Neuropsychiatric things which are\nmore biologically based\num like when you're talking about ADHD\nthings like that\num\nthe the the the ability to cure it\nreally depends on what the disease is\nwhat the severity is how long you've had\nit so uh it's hard to say but definitely\nhas beneficial\num\nbenefits\ndo you have tips for anxiety I could use\nin public and crowded areas uh one of my\nfavorite tips and things that are\nevidence-based as well and using my own\nresearch is the power of diaphragmatic\nbreathing uh it is just so amazing you\ncan essentially breathing from like deep\ninstead of like shallow breathing uh you\ntake a few moments to breathe in and\nbreathe out follow guided meditations on\nYouTube one minute meditation from calm\nheadspace is ones that I personally use\nvery very useful\num and we could also have a chat about\nthis further in the future episodes or\nlive streams as well but that's one that\nI find very helpful\num\nthis one what is the best one way to\nhelp with social anxiety\num okay I'll just share a bit of a\nshort story I know we're probably a\nlittle bit over but you know I grew up\nwith probably the worst social anxiety\nanyone could imagine like I would what I\nwanted to go speak to you I would\nliterally shake and no words or come out\nof my mouth and so as a child I would go\nhome and have a script like um when\npeople said hello to me I would say how\nare you and then when they would say\ngood I would say like okay what do I say\nI like I would practice with my mom okay\nI got so worried and so nervous but uh\njust being able to be here now and like\nchatting with you all and just say\nwhatever I feel like saying it's just\nyeah something that I'm really proud of\nand I think that one way that really\nhelped me personally was essentially the\nthis kind of Step care method that I\njust described so being able to really\nunderstand what is social anxiety\nbecause it looks like something\ndifferent for everyone but there's still\nlike a general definition\nthen being able to ask yourself like why\nwhy do I like what about seeing people\nreally intimidates me for me honestly it\nwas like feeling judged about what\npeople would say about me and the way\nthat I looked and things like that that\nI think some 13 year olds could\nunfortunately relate to a lot of things\nwere just really rude from when I was\nyoung and just lots of worries\num and then tackling that growing up\nreading helped me a lot\num and just having a really strong\nsupport network so I think that's one\nway that really helps me and perhaps it\ncould help you as well if you've got\nanything to add you can really let me\nknow\n[Music]\num\nall right so\nbest self-care advice this could be a\nwhole video on itself okay I will just\nlove to say that I think\num recently in 2023 I wrote down things\nthat absolutely changed my life like\nmicro habits and the number one thing is\nthat I do not check my phone in the\nmorning the first thing I do when I wake\nup is not check my phone my phone is a\nseparate room that is life-changing\nabsolutely life-changing the first thing\nI do when I wake up is do mindful\nmeditation\nfive minutes\nwhen I wake up I have my iPad as my\nalarm I also have bookmarked the calm\nmindfulness guided meditation I do that\nget out of bed I shower do all that I\neat breakfast and then I check my phone\nbecause the idea is that\nyour phone\nyou have emails you have text messages\nyou have work you know like the first\nthing you do when you open your your\neyes is not check on work or like\nwhatever thing that you have in your\nmind so\nthat's my best\nself-care advice\num for that because ultimately\nyou're busy you know I always just watch\nI hear you it's very busy life is hard\nand so the last thing you need when you\nwake up is even more stress that's my\nthoughts on that I hope it helps\nand final question okay let's see\nlet's do a final question before we end\nand uh\nif there's not any then\nwe can always I mean\ncheck back in the comments later but\nbefore we go I just really want to to\nthank you Kimberly for coming here and\nfor sharing your lived expertise and\njust being able to yeah just share your\nopinions hear your advice everything\num it's just truly been a pleasure to\nwork with you as part of the United\nNations Association of Canada\nno problem I'm very very grateful to you\nknow be invited and to be able to\ndiscuss these really vital topics that I\nthink oftentimes go under discussed so\nI'm very grateful to have this platform\nand to be able to share it with you so\nthank you very much as well\nthank you and thank you as well everyone\nfor taking the past 43 minutes with us\nto listen\num to some of the barriers that we\ndiscussed and recognized and to\nlistening to some of the solutions that\nwe shared as well\num again just to summarize from resource\nBanks to self\num directed to peer support networks uh\ntry to self-help ways to find care\nonline and ultimately ways to use\ntechnology to be able to access care\nwherever you are and whenever you need\nit the most and with that thank you so\nmuch and I wish you the best bye"
