    "transcript": "Oprah Winfrey once said don't get\nconfused between what people say you are\nand who you know you are how well do you\nknow yourself if you clicked on this\nvideo you probably want to gain some\nmore insight into your own psychology\nand personality we've already covered\nthe Mayas Briggs today we're talking\nabout the hexaco personality inventory\nthe hexaco was developed by kibion Lee\nand Michael C Ashton in 2000 and\nmeasures the six dimensions of a\npersonality all of the hexaco dimensions\nare on a spectrum you can score very low\nvery high or somewhere in between\nstay tuned to find out your hexaco score\nlet's go\nH is for honesty and humility according\nto Lee and Ashton if you have a high\nscore in honesty humility you probably\ndon't manipulate others to get what you\nwant you aren't interested in Breaking\nrules or achieving a high social status\nyou see yourself as equal to your\nfriends rather than above them and you\ndon't care much about having expensive\nthings or living a luxurious lifestyle a\n2009 study published in the Journal of\nresearch and personality showed that\npeople who are higher in honesty\nhumility are more likely to cooperate\nand act fairly when given a hypothetical\nchoice in how to divide money between\nthemselves and someone else they chose\nto split it equally rather than keep it\nfor themselves even if there weren't any\nconsequences for taking the money on the\nother hand people who have a low score\nof honesty humility are more likely to\nbreak the rules and flatter others to\nget ahead they feel very self-important\nand are highly motivated by money and\nmaterialistic goals e is for\nemotionality\ntake a moment to think about the\nrelationships in your life do you\nheavily empathize with your friends when\nthey feel down and lean on them for\nemotional support this is a sign that\nyou are high in emotionality if you\nscore high in this Factor you might also\nfeel anxious especially in situations\nthat are physically dangerous and have a\nhard time dealing with stressful\nsituations but maybe you feel the\nopposite you don't really feel compelled\nto talk to your friends about your\nproblems you don't form strong\nattachments with them and you don't get\ntoo worried and dangerous or stressful\nsituations according to Lee and Ashton\nthese traits indicate that you might be\nlow in emotionality researchers suggest\nthat emotionality may have an\nevolutionary benefit those who score\nhigh in this Factor tend to seek and\ngive emotional support\ning others in our tribe and getting this\nsupport in return allows us to form\nmutually beneficial relationships that\nincrease our odds of survival\nX is for okay this is kind of cheating\nbut extroversion studies show that out\nof all the hexaco factors extroversion\nis the most strongly associated with\nwell-being according to a study\npublished in personality and individual\ndifferences the higher someone scored in\nextroversion the more likely they were\nto report higher levels of happiness and\nlife satisfaction someone who is highly\nextroverted loves to go to parties and\nsocialize they are confident highly\nenergetic and optimistic if you're low\nin extroversion you might not be too\nenthusiastic about going out and meeting\nnew people you might also struggle to\nfeel confident especially in large\ngroups and feel that you are not well\nliked by others A is for agreeableness a\nhigh level of agreeableness means that\nyou are forgiving non-judgmental and\nCooperative you tend to get along well\nwith others and don't get mad easily if\nyou score low in agreeableness you might\nfind it difficult to forgive people who\nhurt you you may get angry quickly when\nsomeone doesn't treat you well you you\nstrongly defend your point of view and\nyou can easily find flaws in others\naccording to a study by the freeze and\ncolleagues interestingly people who are\nlow in agreeableness were rated by\nothers as being less likable but more\npopular than those who are high in\nagreeableness this could be because the\nless agreeable someone is the more money\nthey tend to make so their peers might\nadmire them because they're successful\nbut may find it difficult to get along\nwith them\nC is for conscientiousness highly\nconscientious people are disciplined and\norganized some people might consider\nthem to be perfectionists they are neat\nmanage their time well work diligently\nto meet their goals and are highly\naccurate in their work they also tend to\nthink through all of their options\nbefore making a decision does this sound\nlike you if so you might score high in\nthe straight this also might be a\nHermione type you know really good in\nschool a study published in the European\nJournal of Personality found that people\nwho are high in conscientiousness are\nalso more likely to perform well\nacademically people who are low in\nconscientiousness don't care as much\nabout keeping a well-organized schedule\nor a clean workspace they don't enjoy\nsetting goals that are hard to\naccomplish and aren't too bothered if\nthey make mistake they can be somewhat\nimpulsive and quick decision makers a\nreal Weasley if you know what I mean and\nfinally O is for openness to experience\nif you are high in openness to\nexperience you might be known as the\nartsy one in your friend group the one\nwho loves nature could spend hours in a\ngallery and is very imaginative you may\nalso be a very curious person who is\ninterested in learning about new topics\nespecially if they are unconventional\ncan't relate to any of these traits then\nyou might be low in openness to\nexperience you might not be very\ninterested in doing creative things and\nthe idea of going to an art gallery just\nsounds boring you might not be\nparticularly excited about learning new\nthings or hearing others ideas when\nlooking for a romantic partner you might\nwant to consider whether the level of\nopenness to experience and honesty\nhumility matches yours a study by Leo\nand colleagues found that when partners\nare similar in these traits or at least\nperceive themselves to be similar they\nhave higher relationship satisfaction\nwherever you fall in the hexaco or any\nother personality model remember that\nthey are no good or bad personality\ntypes someone who is introverted for\nexample is no better or worse than\nsomeone who is extroverted they are\nsimply different the variety of\ndifferent traits that we possess is
