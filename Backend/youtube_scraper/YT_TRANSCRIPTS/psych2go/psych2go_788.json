    "transcript": "hi so did you all know that there's a\ntype of therapy that uses technology to\ntrain the brain to function more\nefficiently\nI was so amazed by this especially\nlearning that there's evidence behind\nusing this sort of therapy neurofeedback\nfor things like PTSD and other\npsychiatric and neurological conditions\nand that's our topic for today's ask an\nexpert series\nthe ask an expert series is a video\nseries podcast where we talk about\nmental health topics with experts so\nthink of people who have lived expertise\nor people who have clinical experiences\njust doing really amazing things\nI'm your host Monica and I'm a medical\nstudent and Neuroscience graduate who is\nreally passionate about all things like\nPsychiatry and neurology\nand so to this end I'm really really\nexcited to be able to chat with you\ntoday and introduce you all to Dr Hill\nbefore I do so I'd like to invite you to\nleave your thoughts and comments in the\nchat box or in the comment section down\nbelow about what you'd like to see and\nif you'd like to be involved whether as\nan interviewee or someone who helped\nwith these interview series then please\nleave me a message in the comment box\nbelow or yeah send me an email\nso\num to begin I would just like to\nintroduce you all to Dr Hill\nhello hi Monica how are you today I'm so\nexcited to be able to get a chat with\nyou uh how are you I'm doing well thanks\nthanks for having me\nof course I like to just start by asking\nyou to introduce yourself and telling\nthe audience a bit more about what you\ndo and some of your background work\nsure so my name is Andrew Hill I'm a PhD\nscientist with a degree in cognitive\nNeuroscience which is the sort of mind\nbrain overlap and unlike most people\nthat get phds in Neuroscience I went\ninto a an applied area so I basically\num teach people how to use Advanced\nNeuroscience tools to do things with\nthemselves so it's a little bit of an\napplied or functional Neuroscience space\nin some way and the tool that I\nprimarily use is something called\nneurofeedback or brain training and\nalongside that we use something called\nbrain mapping or quantitative EEG to\nunderstand the brain but this is uh sort\nof where I'm at now I've gone through an\narc of working with\num children with developmental issues\nall the way through Elders I taught\ngerontology at UCLA for about 12 years\num so Peak brain aging the Neuroscience\nof Aging\num and I have this you know life course\nperspective on how we may want to take\ncontrol of our brains you know things\nthat happen when we're young middle age\nolder and then there's both suffering\nand performance stuff that can be gone\nafter essentially when you do\nthis level of work and gradually the\nbiggest you know I guess differentiator\nuh for both me as a neuroscientist and\nalso my company which is which is Peak\nbrain is that we really operate like\npersonal trainers for your brain instead\nof therapists or doctors so this is a\ntherapeutic intervention used by\npsychologists as you were mentioning in\nthe intro for for trauma quite a lot\nactually it's a deep rich history of\ntools and neurofeedback for uh trauma\nwork\nbut you can work on all kinds of things\nwith a diff with all kinds of\nperspectives and if you know how your\nbrain works\nit can start to reframe the relationship\nof your suffering from something that is\nhappening to you and something you're a\nlittle frustrated about because it's\nlike some phenomena in your body so I\nbasically operate like a scientist and\ncoach and trainer for people's brains\nand teach you how to understand your\nbrain uh and then move into a coaching\nrole as we teach people how to change\ntheir brain activity to shape resources\nthey're interested in taking control\nover\nthat sounds amazing I just heard you\nlike through a couple of terms out there\nEEG neurofeedback for those who are\ncompletely new to this what would you\nkind of tell them like what is this like\nwhat is EEG what is neurofeedback just\nstarting from the basics sure yeah so\nEEG is electricity your brain is making\nbasically the brain's full of neurons\njust like the heart is full of neurons\nand rhythmic patterns create information\nso the heart has this coherent pattern\nyou've all seen on like Gray's Anatomy\nthe EKG it's a very characteristic uh\nsingle almost shape as different\ncircuits come together to create a\nheartbeat that Cycles around the brain\nuses very similar neurons but instead of\ncoordinating in coherent ways they\nactually have this chaotic individual\nlittle module thing going on where they\nsend information out to other modules so\nyou've got billions of little they're\ncalled mini columns or micro columns in\nthe brain and they're little clusters\nlittle Columns of about thirty thousand\nneurons and about a hundred thousand\nglial cells the support structures and\ninformational you know secondary cells\nand this little computational unit is\nbasically a CPU in the brain and you've\ngot millions and millions and millions\nand millions of these things and some of\nthem will operate in a part of the brain\nwith specific jobs\nand some of them will operate in part of\nthe brain well they'll integrate to\nother areas of the brain and some will\noperate where they assemble a network\nand make some friends briefly and then\nlet go and do other things the next\nminute and so all of these little\nmodules all these little activation\nmodes that these These Little Engines\ncan go into\ncan be seen through looking at the sort\nof electrical firing rate these 30 000\ncells will all fire at once in a pattern\nthey'll dance they'll dance together and\nthat dance can come from below once per\nsecond all the way up to several hundred\ntimes per second and that's the\ninformation and coding happening in that\nbit of tissue and a group of those\nlittle columns will actually make lots\nof different brain waves to tune the\nactivity of that little machine that's\nbeing created in that part of the brain\nbe it a permanent if you will machine or\na temporary one\nso we have real slow brain waves called\nthings like Delta\nDelta is the heartbeat of the brain\nkeeps your heart and lungs moving it's\nwhat slow waves sleep you know dreamless\nsleep is made out of but you're also\nusing it a lot when you're awake in the\nbackground if you will you shouldn't\nfeel it you kind of live in it you don't\nthink in it and then you have Theta so\nDelta's about once or twice per second\nlittle slow waves\nand then Theta is more like four times\nper second and Theta is the lubrication\nin the brain it releases the tissue to\ndo its job so if you don't have enough\nof it the tissue gets stuck you get too\nmuch of it in your squirrel if it's\nattention tissue anyways\num you can have for trauma stuff for\nanxiety there's circuits in the brain\nhis job it is to\nevaluate the environment decide what\nyou're thinking about look for threat\npull up thoughts and memories and\ncontext you know almost all forms of\nanxiety even ones that are extremely in\nthe way like trauma response stuff and\nPTSD and developmental trauma\nthey're not really disease processes the\nway we think about that in a medical\ncontext they're much closer to like\ncramped up resources natural things that\nare doing their job but stuck in one\nmode of Regulation\nso I think about trauma a lot you know\nfrom looking at the brain Maps\num\nyes on a mechanically mechanistically\nalpha beta theta Delta these different\nbrain waves beta by the way is an\nactivated gas pedal brain wave and Alpha\nis the neutral brainwave for the rest of\nour discussion today so\num but I think about these modules a\nlittle bit how they how they're tuned\nhow they're running for you and\nyou can sort of conceptualize different\naspects of yourself like you might look\nat other aspects of your body look at\nyour bone density or your lipid panel\nyou can learn something you know\ntriglycerides are high better back off\nin the Ben Jerry's for a couple months\nand you do and you have better\ntriglycerides and you're taking control\nof it and you're not out of control of\nyour you know cholesterol phenomena\nwhatever it is and the same can be true\nof trauma stuff there's a\nthere's a circuit on the back middle of\nthe brain called the posterior cingulate\nand its job is largely to do things like\nah watch the road heads up okay there we\ngo\nand Orient you and alert you to the\noutside world and we're doing it we're\nusing it all day long all the time to\norient to the outside world generally\nthe back of the head\nis the outside world in the front of the\nhead to the inside world we have these\nthings called cingulates that switch the\nattention around internally or\nexternally from the front and back and\nwhen the posterior cingulate cramps up\nwe start evaluating the environment for\ndanger or for threat or for the\npossibility of things going wrong\nand this is kind of like you know your\nlow your lower back might cramp up and\nspasm in a car accident so you can walk\naway\nyour posterior might spasm up and look\nfor the danger so you don't miss it\nagain because it's an adaptation to the\nacuteness if you will of the strain your\nbrain learns suddenly the world is not\nespecially safe or predictable\nand then it over activates that resource\nvery much like having a strong muscle\nthat's gotten spasmed because of how\nactivated it got\nso if I looked at your brain I would see\ndifferent brain wave patterns hanging\nout like fingerprints\nsort of resource signatures and you can\nsee the posterior and anterior cingulate\nas big giant Blobs of brain waves\nsometimes because they're really they're\ncalled the rich Club Rich Hub tissues we\nhave several uh chunks of tissue in the\nbrain that will integrate lots of other\nparts of the brain one group of those\ncircuits is called the default mode\nNetwork which is the sort of referential\nself-musing awareness kind of stuff and\na little racetrack of Consciousness as\nit zips around and it zips through the\ncingulates\nand you know how these things are\nactivating if they're making lots of\nalpha then you're not as activated in\nthe singulits if you're making lots and\nlots of beta the one on the back you're\ncaught in your gut and you're ruminating\none in the front you're caught in your\nhead and you're perseverating so often\nwith trauma response you see the\nobsessiveness in the front and the\nthreat sensitivity in the back and the\nperson's brain is sort of playing ping\npong with stuff that bothers them did\nyou hear I heard did you worry did you\nworry didn't hear and you can't sort of\nlet that settle back down even you\ncognitively know that you don't need to\nbe activated the way you are your brain\nhas moved into the mode it it learned it\nbetter darn well do for safety reasons\nbut humans are you know creative and\nintelligent and we can catastrophize and\nthink of what could go wrong\nyou know so that's\nunfortunately that adaptation can then\ngo uh other places it's you know complex\nso anyways those are brain waves things\nwe can see through the head you know\nfrom the outside as activation\nsignatures of different parts of the\nbrain and then we're able to just add on\nlike we're able to modulate it and\nbecause sometimes as you were mentioning\num it could be a bit over activated or\nunder activated probably contributing to\nsome sort of distress that people might\nbe feeling and I suppose that neural\nfeedback would allow us to better\nmodulate that and to tune it kind of\nlike fine tune it is that my\nunderstanding correct I don't know\nexactly yeah yeah briefly tune it and\nget a subjective experience and validate\nwhat you think is going on because just\nto back up for a second when we look at\nyour brain waves\nthe way we sort of interpret what's\ngoing on is not oh my gosh you're\nunusual something's wrong because guess\nwhat people are weird\nthey are like we're not expecting you to\nbe average but yet we have to look at\nyour brain compared to something so we\nuse an age match sample and say aha\nhere's a bunch of ways in which you're\ndifferent than average you get extra\nbeta waves over here and theta waves\nover there and Alpha Waves over here and\nthat's a true statement but that doesn't\nhave like construct or psychological\nvalidity it has sort of just basic data\nvalidity so I would have to say to\nsomebody hey you've got a lot of beta on\nthe back midline\nare you a little threat sensitive do you\nruminate are you activated that way if\nthey were like oh gosh yes I that's\nthat's true okay now we're in the realm\nof plausible for you that's cool so now\nwe can decide is that important to work\non oh it is all right let's exercise\ndown that extra beta perhaps bring up\nthe alpha briefly and see how it feels\nand for that particular resource pretty\nreliable so most of the time someone\nwould go oh yeah I felt really good\nlet's do more of that but here's here's\nhow it actually works here's how we\nchange your brain here's how we mess\nwith your head\num in the case of the cingulates\nbe it uh PTSD phenomena or OCD in the\nfront or ticks or all singular driven\nphenomena so if you bite your nails or\nhave Tourette's or have intrusive\nthoughts they're often the cingulates\nare heavily involved again as these\nnatural circuits that cramp up pretty\neasily\nso you often would stick wires on one or\nboth of those above the scalp just you\nknow stuck on the head very briefly and\nthen an ear clip or two and measure in\nreal time the amount of activity coming\nout of the cingulates maybe the amount\nof beta waves moment to moment that beta\nis going to fluctuate and change on its\nown and you're also going to make some\nAlpha some neutral resting brain wave\nthat's between the activation tone\nmoment to moment as well so the computer\nwatches your brain and whenever you\nhappen to make\nless beta and more Alpha for half a\nsecond the computer goes oh good job it\nmakes a game and the screen start to\nmove so little puzzle pieces start to\nfill in or pack many some dots or your\ncar drives faster and the Brain says Hey\nstuff is happening I kind of like stuff\nwhat's that stuff nice and then a couple\nseconds later the beta comes back up and\nthe alpha dips the brain the computer\nsees that and the car slows down or the\nor the puzzle piece is stall and the\nBrain says Hey where's my stuff I like I\nlike stuff more than no stuff I'm having\nno stuff huh and a couple seconds later\nit happens to move the right direction\nagain\nand the game resumes so the big trick\nhere is we move the goal post every 30\nseconds or so we adjust what we're\nasking for so as a medical as a doctor\nto be in a neuroscience student you've\nalready picked up on the fact that this\nis operant conditioning\nbasically so for folks that are psych\nstudents there's you know or folks that\naren't we've all heard of Pavlov's dog\ndrooling from a bell that's not what\nthis is that's all learning is basically\nwhat's called associative learning we\ntie things together but in pavlovian\nconditioning you take things that aren't\nnormally Associated and tied them\ntogether this is scenarian conditioning\nor operant conditioning where you take\nstuff that already exists and you shape\nit in a certain direction you're already\nmaking brain waves so if you put a\nlittle measurement sort of criteria in\nthe computer right next to what you're\ndoing and then watch it when it\nfluctuates on its own in a certain\ndirection applaud that the brain goes\nwell that's interesting huh okay and\nthis is no different than basic learning\nwhen you're a little baby flopping\naround and you manage the little baby\npush-up and you can see 15 feet you're\nlike whoa information that's so cool the\nnext day you're like let me see some\nmore and you just push yourself back up\nand you can see again you weren't they\ncan wait left bicep right right bicep\nyou just learn the association you know\nof information flow with the ACT\nactivation of those particular neurons\nand with some trial and error you learn\nto crawl or walk or whatever\nand in this case because we're dragging\nthe criteria around gently\nthe brain will start to reach in this\ncase let's say for more Alpha\nand somewhere around two or three or\nfour sessions in to your first\nneurofeedback experience\nis when you feel something not usually\nright away\nit can happen but it's a little more\nrare so usually a few sessions in after\nthe session the brain's like oh wait a\nminute Alpha's producing information\nokay I want some more Alpha and it Jacks\nthe alpha up in the posterior cingulate\nfor a couple hours and you're like oh I\nfelt kind of chill that was really\nreally strange\nhuh nah maybe I didn't feel it okay try\nit again\nand if we're in the ballpark of reality\nyou feel it again and it's stronger so\nyou have this relationship with your\nbrain it becomes iterative and gentle\nand you can test stuff and see how\nanxiety stuff feels or executive\nfunction things and you get reliable\nchanges on anxiety features executive\nfunction features sleep speed of\nprocessing brain fog so the gross stuff\nthat is that all human brains do\nespecially when that cramps up hard like\nall humans have anxiety but when those\nresources are cramped now we have\ndysregulated you know diagnosed if you\nwill levels of anxiety but the resources\nare not atypical they're just not\nregulated real law right now so that's\nthe stuff that we have the most uh\nvisibility over in those population\nmetrics the qeg or brain mapping and\nhave the most reliable ability to change\nusing neurofeedback so we trained the\nbrain for half an hour about three times\na week\nstarting about a week and a half in\nyou're like oh wait a minute huh and\nthen we're having a report to us what\nyou're noticing and we adjust your\nworkouts and we have people map their\nbrain about every other month\nand for things like features of anxiety\nor ADHD or stuff like that we can get\nabout a full standard deviation in the\nbell curve every other month\nso when I work with acute PTSD for\ninstance with veterans six weeks in\nthey're like Doc I'm feeling awesome am\nI done I'm like well you know because\nthese these are often tough people right\nso they're ready to go on with the next\nstep of their lives but in six weeks you\ncan usually pull the teeth of classic\nintrusive\nyou know PTSD complex PTSD developmental\nslow moving relational stuff\nattachment stuff a little slower and\nthere I would want to do like\nregulatory resilience stuff on sleep\nstress and attention and then you can\ndig down to the subcortical structures\nby tapping the ones that are cortical\nfor instance a lot of Developmental\ntrauma might be driven by\nthere's a structure it's kind of beneath\nor maybe in front of in the chain of\ninformation the posterior cingulate\ncalled the periaqueductal gray and when\nI was first in school\nall we were taught about the pag is that\nit dumps uh painkillers into the central\nCanal when you do things like slam your\nthumb with a hammer turns out pag is\nvery sensitive to emotional pain too\nso if you're exposed to high levels of\nstress when you're very young the pag\ndevelops this\nsensitization for the possibility of\npain occurring in the future so it's not\nthe the trauma response itself\nit's sort of like the voice in your head\nthat's been yelling at you for 30 years\nabout the trauma you missed\nuh when you were younger and it's the\nsort of pre-alert almost not the alert\nbut the pag is not cortical it's\nsubcortical in some ways you can't see\nit in an EEG you wouldn't know it's\nhaving trouble\nyou'd see other stuff sleep issues and\ngeneral anxiety you can see you can see\nsensory integration issues you can see\nsocial uh cueing and social overwhelm\nstuff sometimes a big circuit behind the\nright ear called the tempo parietal\nJunction\ncingulates but these are all things that\nI would walk through with someone and\nsay hey is this you does this matter\nlike I teach them to read brain maps and\nthey teach me what's important in the\nmaps while we go through data\nessentially and after that we have the\nworkout plan starting to form\nyeah that's so interesting I never\nthought of it sort of like operant\ncondition that you put on an electrical\ncellular level an involuntary Behavior\nbasically yeah the brain waves so most\nneurofeedback is involuntary you're like\nthis can't be working yeah and then\nthree sessions and you're like oh wait a\nminute huh\nokay and then and then every session\nfeels like something different as you\nchange gear so then it's kind of fun to\npush your brain okay so essentially it's\nlike yeah it's brain training so it\nwas operant conditioning to modify the\ndifferent kind of electrical signals\nthat me we might be getting that might\nbe Associated the resting tone the\nTendencies of the circuits to activate\nor relax or you know for ADHD the real\ncommon one in the right hand side\nthere's a circuit involved with sleep\nmaintenance and with uh knowing you're\npaying attention and it uses a low\nfrequency beta that we discovered\nneurofeedback around this frequency\ncalled SMR uh the neurofeedback guys\npractice clinically is um was discovered\nin the mid 60s uh on cats\nand the frequency we that was being\nmanipulated kind of by mistake in some\nways uh that we discovered is a\nfrequency cats make tons of if you've\nseen a cat lying on a windowsill that\nstill body and laser-like focus humans\nuse that too to sit still to not be\nreactive to stay asleep to not have\nseizures so literally the comcat in the\nwindowsill is the opposite of ADHD like\nlike literally it's the same brainwave\nState Higher versus low\nand SMR or this low beta wave relative\nto the Theta the lubrication of the\nbrain is involved with dis-inhibition if\nyou have too much Theta and not enough\nof this low power beta things are\ndisinhibited and that can happen on the\nmotor strip left to right and produce\nexecutive functions sleep other kind of\nbroad stuff when it happens front to\nback on the cingulates\nthe high Theta you don't get like an\nlike a classic anxiety you know very hot\nkind of experience internally you get a\ndisinhibited experience internally\nso you can get people with diagnoses if\nyou will or complaints that are PTSD\nlike you look at their brain and they\nhave a giant blob of theta on the front\nmidline the anterior cingulate and\nthat's somebody who has songs playing in\ntheir head all day long or they bite\ntheir nails aggressively or they have um\nyou can sometimes see the anterior\ncingulate and then the spot behind the\nright ear which is the tempo parietal\nJunction for drinking the world in when\nthose are both hot people have\nenvironmentally or people focused\nanxiety triggers things like misophonia\nwhere people's sound of chewing will\ndrive you nuts or agoraphobia or\nclaustrophobia that can be it can be\nvery similar circuits so when somebody\nwalks in kind of the point of this this\nuh tour through different anxiety\nflavors in the brain is when someone\nwalks in the diagnostic label\nI care much less about the diagnostic\nlabel than I do about which resources\nare operating which ways for you can you\nunderstand them does it make sense is\nthere some set of resources that you\nwould like to change and often I mean\noften when I look at someone's brain who\nhas a particular diagnostic label\nthe picture of what they're experiencing\nis much more nuanced someone comes in\nwith you know tons of anxiety complaints\nand diagnostic goals and they have a\nbunch of brain fog and sleep issues\nshowing up that are related or someone\ncomes in with an ADHD response a\ndiagnosis and goals around executive\nfunction and you look at their brain and\nthey're like traumatized like\ndramatically and not sleeping and that's\nwhy they're not you know doing their\nhomework or paying attention to schools\nbecause they're burnt out during the day\nfalling asleep and having sleep anxiety\nat night or something but a psychologist\nsat there in the school classroom went\nare you having trouble paying attention\nand the kid went huh because they were\nhalf out of it oh yeah check mark ADHD\nso the point here is not to reinforce\nany diagnoses you may be having trauma\nresponses or anxiety phenomena\nBut anxiety is a natural phenomena when\nit's appropriate and then you want able\nto put it down again you know the the\nfront midline when it's super hot can be\nOCD or it can be a CEO who is hyper\nfocused the back midline can be a threat\nsensitivity in your mind's looking for\nthe danger all the time\nor you're an effective lifeguard\nor a mom with like too much chaos going\non as catching stuff and keeping little\nyou know frantic kids safe we have\nresources\nthat tend to get overused over activated\nbut they're not unnatural resources in\nfact if you're having a trauma response\nhaving a like a strong visceral threat\nanxiety response it's a powerful part of\nyour brain it's doing its job kind of\ntoo well it's kind of like a big big\nstrong muscle\nif I show it to you on your brain\non your brain mapping\nit changes your relationship with it\nsuddenly you're like oh wait a minute oh\nyeah I am ruminating I am threat\nsensitive okay I don't know my brain\nthat's so annoying but you suddenly stop\nbeing like guilty or ashamed or feeling\noverwhelmed or as overwhelmed when you\ncan make it mechanic a mechanical or\noperational a little bit just like your\nlipid panel you know 50 years ago and no\none did lipid panels and well we didn't\nhave tons of sugar in in this country\nanyways but we didn't have the agency\nthere's no gym on the corner to go like\nburn off the you know the body fat risks\nand things but this is just that next\nEvolution where you should have I feel\nyou should have some agency\nuh and a lot of what we consider psych\nstuff I feel\nwe are we should be our own experts we\ncan be our own experts we shouldn't rely\nnecessarily on yet another\ntreatment provider to be right for us to\ngive us the right label to give us the\nright intervention that's wonderful if\nthey're right\nbut the brain's imperfect and people\naren't their labels and aren't their\ndiagnoses and aren't don't fit into\nbuckets so a lot of people get imperfect\ntreatment for things that are pretty\nacute because of the narrowness of that\nlabel I mean those tools those labels\nwere developed for insurance companies\nnot for individuals and not for doctors\nso they don't often\nfit the person's experience super well\nand showing you what your brain's\nactually doing I find to be uh\nmore useful than giving it a name you\nknow giving it a certain scary word or\ntwo\nthere's my soapbox no that's amazing I\njust have so many questions because like\nI've never heard of this like it's my\nfirst time I mean I've gone through\nundergrad I've gone through grad school\nand surprisingly I mean neural feedback\nisn't like that new and I it's my first\ntime really learning about this yeah so\nI'm just really yeah really amazed and\num I've just been wondering because I\nmean it's very very true that I think\npeople should take and take charge of\ntheir own wellness and look at a\nmodality many different modalities in\nterms of like what works for them so for\npeople who are coming in to get brain\nscans to what extent do they also\num do other sort of things like CBT or\nis it primarily just um doing\nneurofeedback what is a typical\npresentation of your clients I was about\nhalf and half people who are not doing\nother things and people who are and in a\ntrauma and anxiety context people often\neither have a therapy support system\nthat they're working with DBT CBT\num a lot of family systems theory work\nwhich a lot of my trauma clients love a\nlot of somatic experiencing\num if there's attachment trauma early\nlife trauma DBT becomes sort of like a\nhigh priority for folks I would I would\nsay\nbut I also get folks that have been\ndealing with their anxiety and Trauma\nfor 10 15 20 years that are experts in\nit that have gone through all kinds of\ninterventions that have tried all kinds\nof stuff and they're kind of really\nSavvy at managing the activation\nmanaging the dysregulation when it\nhappens and they're done with meds or\ntherapy or they've tried everything and\nnothing works I get a lot of people like\nthat actually\nand so you know I'm I'm here to be part\nof the team and I don't want to replace\na therapist and if people ask me about\nthat combination I sort of paint a\npicture of the neurofeedback coaches as\nthe as the coach in the gym the strength\nand conditioning coach helping you build\nthe resource and your therapist like the\ncoach in the field helping you realize\nyou've dropped your elbow when you're\nreleasing or something so it's a it's a\nit's a resource versus skill thing and\nskills are voluntary and effortful and\nnuanced and you develop them that's true\nof stress response stuff\nbut you can pull the teeth of being\ntriggered by it with the resource\nmanipulation with neurofeedback so we\ndon't do therapy directly but I work\nwith an awful lot of therapists as you\nmight imagine but we do mindfulness\ntraining as our piece of it is you train\nthe brain train the mind and many people\ndo other interventions and we're also\nsort of that biohacker Wellness space so\na lot of my clients do additional things\nmacronutrient partitioning and cycling\nto create hermetic stressors and\nanti-aging effects\num high level interventions like\nHyperbaric medicine or red light therapy\npeptides nootropics all kinds of\nbiohacking being done and we sort of\noften operate like a best practices you\nknow check a sounding board oh yeah the\nthing you asked about that's totally\nbunk don't don't do that oh that thing\nyeah we like keto but\nhere's how we suggest to do it not the\nway the gurus are saying for instance\num so we try to give people that sense\nof agency\nand teach them the neuro they need to\nknow\nand then we provide uh ongoing support\nso not only the\nthe the neurofeedback which is one of\nour heavy lifters if you will\nbut all of our offices we have four\noffices in the U.S they all provide\num whenever you do a brain map with us\nyou get a membership that's a year long\nso maps are free for a year and in the\nUS maps usually are Grand or more and\nand ours are much much less in fact all\nyour listeners can get a discount if\nthey want to our offices it's normally\n500 bucks a year for a membership but\nit's 250 for your listeners\nor your viewers if those of you on\nYouTube right now or Facebook watching\nus\num that gets you the ability to map your\nbrain and learn about it and look at it\nmaybe you're going to map your brain on\ncaffeine or cannabis or Adderall or\nXanax or whatever it is you can learn\nhow your brain works these gross\nfeatures of stress sleep attention\nand\nsince the mapping is free and the tools\nare there and the coaches are super\nexcited to help you map your brain\nit starts becoming this relationship\nwith your brain that changes gradually\nand progressively over time even if you\ndon't do neurofeedback if you see how\nyour meds are changing your brain or\nyour new meditation practice or your new\nsleep hacking or whatever it is or you\ncan look at your brain and realize how\nbad your alcohol habit might be or you\nknow how visible your trauma is as I'm\nsaying earlier it can be very frame when\nyou see it as a part of your brain\ninstead of something that's just\nhappening to you\num anyways uh we would want to you know\nteach everyone their their perspective\nuh\nuh the perspective taking sort of you\nknow exercise of looking at their brain\num I'm not that surprised you haven't\nheard about it even though you're you're\na neuroscience student and you're now a\nmed student it's rarely taught in med\nschool\nand when I was applying to grad school\nin the early 2000s\nyeah\num\nI had to be careful using the word\nbiofeedback or neurofeedback or\nadmissions committees rolled their eyes\nlike obviously\nuh it's one of those like fringy things\nyou know 20 years ago now\num but you know I went to grad school\nUCLA arguably one of the better uh psych\ninstitutions in the world and uh about\nhalfway into my PhD program I noticed\nthe sea change and all the senior\nscientists and all the big names like\nhey you're doing nerfy back research\nthat's pretty cool you want to use one\nof my tools when you're testing and\nthere was this like sudden interest in\nyou know about a decade ago and I think\nthat the availability of this stuff the\ntools come down in cost the access is\ncoming up\num for us the pandemic accelerated\nremote work so we have everything we do\navailable virtually as well although the\nreally good memberships only available\nin the offices for that free ongoing\naccess we can't send data out unlimited\nor equipment out unlimited for free for\nyou unfortunately\num but we would like to generally to to\nto uh\nsolve that thing you just described\nwhich is whoa I've never heard about\nthis I can't tell you I mean I've seen\nseven eight thousand clients in the past\ndecade or more and I cannot tell you the\nnumber of times the number of hundreds\nof times if somebody gets two or three\nweeks in four weeks in\nand has had some interesting experiences\nchanges in sleep changes in stress\nresponse changes in seizures or\nmigraines or whatever\nand then they say to me\nwhy why is everyone else doing this\nlike I hear that so often why why didn't\nI know about this\nand I felt that way I trained my brain\nfor the first time at age 28. and I was\nlike oh oh okay I can go back to grad\nschool now because I now got control\nover my executive function stuff but why\nwas no one teaching me about this stuff\n30 you know years ago whenever it was so\nuh it's a bit it's a nice tool to have\nsome control over your over your brain\neven if it's imperfect even if it's in a\nsort of iterative and Progressive\ninstead of a simple\nsolution yeah for sure like I'm a huge\nproponent to giving people choice to\nhave resources to really take charge of\ntheir health especially evidence-based\nchoices so hopefully everyone here today\nlearned a bit about neurofeedback I\ncertainly did and yeah just getting to\ninvest in yourself really to you know\nlearn about yourself from the\nintrospective perspective from the\nelectrical brain perspective really\nanything\num just being able to explore and see\nwhat works or what doesn't work because\nthen either way you know so I think it's\na really cool thing and yeah thank you\nvery much oh of course my pleasure\nbefore we end this I just really wanted\nto uh spend a few moments to just really\nhighly to everyone where people can find\nyou so you mentioned that you have\ndifferent yes we had different offices\nphysical offices in New York City in Los\nAngeles uh in St Louis so you know both\ncoasts and kind of in the middle for you\nthe folks in Colorado are cursing my\nname right now because there's nothing\nin the mountains sorry but um we also do\nour whole program so neurofeedback is\nusually a few months long we send all\nthe gear out we work with you and it's\nreally involved so if you want to do a\nwhole program with us you don't need to\nbe near an office we do everything\npretty much equivalent in and out of our\noffices but if you want to map your\nbrain and get access to sort of like the\nbiohacker special and have this tool\nthen you'd have to come into La St Louis\nNew York City or Orange County\nCalifornia and we'll probably have a few\noverseas we have some other partners we\nwork with overseas too soon that'll\nbecome other Peak brain uh offices but\num that piece of it normally our our\nmembership in the office is 500 bucks a\nyear again we'll we'll give for the\nfolks who are watching a half price\nmembership so it's 250 if you want to\nsee what your brain looks like and you\ncan use the same discount if you wanted\nto to do a neurofeedback program those\nare a few thousand dollars but if you\nwant to apply the same 250 off you can\ndo that for one of the larger programs\nand then just check us out in the\nsocials most of our socials are Peak\nbrain LA because that was our first\noffice and I'm also at like Andrew Hill\nPhD but that's mostly like cooking so if\nyou want to watch you cook go for it but\nPeak brain La is where all of our health\nand wellness Our biohacking advice we\nhave giveaways uh we have a little\ncampaigns throughout the year that we do\nfor health and wellness challenges so\namazing yeah join our join our socials\nand Bug us and tell us what you're\ninterested in\nfor for brain stuff and we'll you know\nsee we can do\nthank you so much yeah to anyone\nvisiting there mentioned I guess you\nwant just like to go video and then you\ngot to take advantage of the great\ndiscounts that's right that's right\num yeah thank you so much for teaching\nme teaching everyone about neurofeedback\ntelling us about really how it works\nwhat we can expect out of it and letting\nus know where to find you and with that\nthank you everyone for watching if you\nhave any other thoughts or comments or\nif you'd like to be involved again get\nin contact at Monica psych2go.net and\nyeah until then see you in the next live\nstream bye thank you"
