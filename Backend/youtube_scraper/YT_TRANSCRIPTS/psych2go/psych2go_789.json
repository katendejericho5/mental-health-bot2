    "transcript": "hello psych2goers gather around yes all\nof you don't just because the word alone\nis in the title this is like The\nFortress of Solitude\nbadass right yeah all you quiet type\nintroverts know what we mean we can be\nalone and we aren't lonely yeah yeah\nyeah on Instagram Tick Tock whatever\nthere's an awful lot of try hard\nshouting that constantly being around\nOodles of people is the best thing ever\nwant to know a secret\nit ain't all that in fact\nsometimes the party person envies the\nhappy to be alone person\nif you can be satisfied and happy just\nspending time with yourself you avoid\nmassive fomo anxiety and you don't need\npants are the people independent throw\nyour hands up at me bonus being alone\nhas even more benefits than just being\ngood with your bad self things like one\ngetting to focus on you and learning\nsomething new in the process\nas super as we are we have finite\nresources\nsocially a goodly chunk of our energy\ngoes to fitting in somewhat you know\nthings like watching what you say and\nnegotiating activities so you can get\nalong with others but solo time means\nyour resources are all yours\nyes\nyou can assess what's important to you\nand what you're passionate about not\nwhat do all of you want to do so sign up\nfor that dance class because you want to\nwant to learn Photoshop Basics you can\nwatch all the tutorials hey if you're\nstill hankering for company after the\nfact new learning means new people\nnumber two boosting creativity not\nhaving to think or appease others means\nfreedom you made Donna Kilt if you wish\nno pants bonus remember you have the\nfreedom to let your mind's creativity go\nto town no one else is exerting\nlimitations or pressuring a specific\nagenda on you if you're doing something\nfor yourself and solo you don't have to\nconform to anything let the innovating\nMaestro in you fly high\nyou can choose later if you want to\nshare and trim accordingly at that time\nso no big right number three\nauthenticity\nbe like water my friend\nyou know ironic that we're saying this\nin a video that's on YouTube via the\ninternet but\ndoesn't negate the fact that internet\nand info technology is a blessed with\nsuck situation never before has so much\nknowledge and so many differing views\nbeen readily available\nyet also never before has there been so\nmuch noise drowning out your inner voice\nthe one that says this is me if you've\never wondered is this what I think or is\nit just popular then you understand\nbeing able to shut the front door giving\nyourself space and peace lets you avoid\nbecoming one of the sheeple you get to\nthink independently about who you are\nand what you stand for who do you want\nto be for your sake\nwhen you can get that solid grasp on\nyour own identity you naturally become\nmore confident you know yourself so you\ncan trust yourself and be authentic\nnumber four it enhances the quality of\nyour relationships\nwe're not advocating separation or\nbreakups here we just mean space\nas much as we love our people we get\nused to them it doesn't mean you love\nthem less just they become part of the\nnorm nothing stays novelty new forever\nwhen you take time separately from the\nrelationship to care for yourself you\ntake a break from that Norm\nsolo time lets you reaffirm your own\nvalue and what you bring while at the\nsame time increasing understanding and\nvalue in others\nit's like refreshing the noticeability\nof the other person and the view of the\nrelationship as a whole number five it\nimproves your mental well-being\nyou know those days impatient clients\nyour short staffed and you had to do\novertime and now you're home the last\nthing you need is more questions more\ndemands more uh\nnope\npeace\nyou want to think with no one barging in\non you\nexperiencing that spot of solitude and\nfinding comfort in it improves Stress\nManagement increases life satisfaction\nand enables focused attention which\nimproves recall and retention of\ninformation\nall of this in short lets you get a grip\nso you don't feel lost hopeless or\ncompelled to do something unwise out of\ndesperation\nand number six\nyou can make sure that the cake is not a\nlie you love someone\nokay fine you like someone or there's\nsomeone who makes you smile\nand that's a positive\nhappiness is a strange thing though like\na deceptively small cheesecake it's\nsweet it looks light and when you have\nto eat a whole slice on your own it\nfeels like a brick\nbeing happy with someone is good giving\nsomeone the impossible responsibility\nfor your happiness is a lose-lose for\neveryone\nit's forcing this person to become an\nextension of you\nyou're bleeding off your power and\ngiving it to them depending on this\noutside source\ndisappointment or a breakup becomes a\ntraumatic amputation why Nerf your\npowers you know what you need\nwhen you make your own happy cake\nregardless of how outside influences\nturn out you still have your cake you\nare your own solid foundation and even\nif you're not in Kansas anymore you're\nstill you processing emotions is like\nchanging the frosting you're still whole\nand you'll get over the piping not being\npurple anymore no one dictates how you\nfeel and no one owns you if you're not\nused to being alone it can feel a little\nunnerving if so ask yourself\nI'm with me why do I feel uncomfortable\nis this the first time you haven't had\nto cater to others and you don't know\nhow to cater to yourself\nwho you tend to fear the unknown maybe\nyou're not as happy with yourself as you\nbelieve but you're awesome get to know\nyou\nto those of us who are comfortable alone\nRevel in your wisdom you are the master\nof your fate you are the captain of your\nsoul and we salute you how did these\npoints affect you and can you relate\nwhen was the last time you realized that\nyou thrive in solitude\ndiscuss share and like thanks for\nwatching and we'll see you soon"
