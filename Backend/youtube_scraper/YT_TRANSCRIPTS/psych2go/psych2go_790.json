    "transcript": "there is a love story in every human\nbeing that has ever lived some are happy\nsome are tragic but every single person\nhas their Encounter With Love\nfor some despite all their efforts love\nis elusive\nsometimes the problem is being unable to\nfind the right person\nto a certain degree it is pure chance\nthat we come across the person whom we\nmay refer to as our soul mate\nthat should not discourage you because\nthere are secrets backed up by\npsychology Define the right person for\nyou\nnumber one manage your expectations\nwe've all heard the saying the Heart\nWants What It Wants and this may be true\nbut when it comes to finding the person\nfor you it's important to be realistic\nif you've been infatuated with one\nperson for a long time and have faced\nrepeated rejections from them you have\nto accept that it isn't going to happen\nthe best thing to do when looking for\nlove is always to work on yourself first\nprincess Braxton Davis explains in the\nMcNair Scholars journal 2010. in order\nto form a relationship there must be\nsome type of Attraction either\nphysically or on a personality level\ninitial attraction to a potential mate\nis highly associated with physical\nattractiveness\nunderstand that everyone has different\npreferences and expectations you can't\nexpect to receive things that you would\nbe incapable of offering to the\nrelationship\nwhile having differences is certainly\nimportant and keeps things interesting\nyou can't expect someone who for example\nhas honed in their sense of style to be\nimmediately attracted to someone with no\ninterest in looking presentable the same\napplies to people who pay Keen attention\nto physical health falling in love with\nsomeone who pays no attention to their\nphysical health or someone who works a\nhigh-paying job falling in love with\nsomeone who has no job\nthat being said this mostly applies to\nthe initial attraction mentioned by\nPrincess Braxton Davis which is largely\ndependent on physical attractiveness\nhowever when finding the right person\nfor you there is more to it than\nphysical attractiveness number two\nyou should share more than surface level\ninterests with them\nwhile the idea of being in a\nrelationship with someone who loves the\nsame music and movies as you sounds\nideal research shows that it's far more\nimportant for you and your partner to\nshare the same core values this can mean\nthat you share a religion have the same\nor similar political alignment and share\nsimilar views on most of your core\nbeliefs as found by Travis G Perry where\nhe writes in his 2016 thesis\nresearch on shared beliefs particularly\nshared religious beliefs has shown them\nto be a positive predictor of marital\nsatisfaction disagreements are to be\nexpected but all of these things should\ninform you as to whether or not someone\nis actually the right one for you as\nPerry elaborates further couples that\nagree with each other on their most\nimportant values argue less and find\ntheir marriage to be more enjoyable\nif these shared beliefs aren't built\ninto the foundation of your relationship\nor in other words are not present in the\nperson you are interested in it is\nunlikely that it'll work out long term\nnumber three\nthere is a strong social connection\nWhen We Were Young we were taught not to\ntalk to strangers so why should we think\nthat approaching someone with whom we\nhave little to no social connection and\nproposing a romantic relationship is a\ngood idea sure there's always the\npossibility of getting someone's number\nor Instagram handle but the chances are\nnot in your favor even if you approach\nperfectly and respectfully there's still\na very good chance that they'll say no\nfurthermore if you've gotten past the\npoint of initial attraction the question\nStill Remains is this the right person\nfor me and so Begins the laborious and\noften heartbreaking task of finding out\nmore about this person only to decide\nthat you're nothing alike\nthe cycle of going from strangers to\nbeing romantically involved is quickened\nwith modern tools such as dating apps\noftentimes these apps depend largely on\nan initial physical attraction and\ntherefore do not allow the process of\ngetting to understand someone's sense of\nhumor likes dislikes and beliefs to\nunfold in an organic way\nthe truth is that the right person for\nyou is far more likely to exist in your\nSocial Circles a 2019 study by muli Yang\nand one bin Zhao published in cyber\npsychology behavior and social\nnetworking found that having a large\nnumber of choices for potential romantic\nPartners as one would find on dating\napps had a negative impact on decision\nmaking if there isn't anyone in your\nsocial network who you feel is right for\nyou try to expand your Social Circles do\nit with the intention of Simply making\nfriends and getting to know new people\nfirst and foremost\nthe relationship struggles aside and\ntruly get to know the people around you\nand your new friends before making\nromantic advances\nthis is the best way to know whether or\nnot someone is right for you before\nmaking any Grand commitments\nnumber four\ndon't change who you are just to suit\nsomeone you like\nit's been understood that being\nauthentic to yourself greatly benefits\nyour romantic relationships not only\ndoes it affect the relationship Itself\nby improving satisfaction and commitment\nbut it also helps you find the right\nperson for you according to Robert E\nWickman in the Journal of experimental\nsocial psychology authenticity appears\nto Signal trustworthiness and stability\nwhich are great character traits to\ndisplay when seeking a partner being\nopen about who you are and what you\nbelieve in will attract someone who has\nsimilar values\nit's impossible to find the right person\nfor you when you aren't being yourself\nnot only does it affect the process of\nfinding the right person for you but if\nyou're successful in finding a\nrelationship by changing who you are to\nsuit someone it's unlikely that the\nrelationship will last\npressure of not being able to share true\nthoughts and passions with your partner\nwill lead to resentment and will poison\nthe relationship over time\nand number five\ntake it easy\nyou might be at a stage in your life\nwhere love has eluded you to the point\nthat the concept of love sounds like a\nmyth\ndo not let this discourage you love can\nbe magical but it can also bring a lot\nof pain as anyone who has ever had an\nencounter with love you included will\nknow\nwhen it comes to finding the right\nperson for you A desperate search might\nlimit you to a selection of partners\nthat may not be ideal\ntake your time and be patient\nat a certain point you have to wonder if\na perfect person like we see in rom-coms\nand TV shows like How I Met Your Mother\nis realistic is there someone who will\nfulfill all of your criteria for what a\nperfect partner should be and if that\nperson does exist would they reciprocate\nthose feelings\nas you get older these questions become\nscarier but I say again take it easy you\nmay be surprised by what you think of as\nperfect when you find it the only\npredictable thing about love\nReal Love is that it's unpredictable it\ncan come to you slowly over years and\nyears of knowing someone or it can come\nto you suddenly and unexpectedly\nlove is terrifying that is true but the\nJourney of finding the right person for\nyou is exciting the only thing
