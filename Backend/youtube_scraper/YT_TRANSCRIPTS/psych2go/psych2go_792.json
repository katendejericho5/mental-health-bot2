    "transcript": "do you know someone who is diagnosed\nwith ADHD ADHD also known as attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder is a\nneurobiological condition that causes\ndistractibility hyperactivity and\nimpulsivity symptoms because there's\nstill many who aren't aware of what ADHD\nis they may say things that are hurtful\nand validating or even discriminatory So\nto avoid this here are five things you\nshould never say to someone with ADHD\nand what you should say instead number\none are you sure it's ADHD if they're\nalready diagnosed with it there's really\nno point in questioning them about it\nfurther even if you say it with good\nintentions it still comes off as rude\nand dismissive while you may be saying\nit because a lot of people doubt an ADHD\ndiagnosis\nsince some may say oh it's just children\nbeing children or they've always been\nclumsy and inattentive it's just their\npersonality but this isn't necessarily\ntrue before a child is diagnosed with\nADHD they undergo a full physical exam\nvision and hearing test as well as a\nnon-invasive skin called the\nNeuropsychiatric EEG based assessment\nAid or the neighbor system to measure\nTheta and brain waves and while a\ndiagnosis for adults is trickier it's\nstill possible to get an accurate one\nafter a healthcare professional looks at\ntheir history conducts family interviews\nin physical neurological and\npsychological tests so don't go around\nasking whether they're sure it's ADHD or\nnot number two it's probably because of\nhow you were raised did you know that\nADHD can be a genetic condition\naccording to Griffin for any child with\nADHD there's a 30 to 40 chance that one\nof their parents has it too remember\nthat ADHD can be challenging for both\nchildren and parents children who have\nADHD May face a higher chance of being\nbullied and rejected resulting in lower\nqualities of life and the parents of\nchildren with ADHD May doubt and\nquestion themselves on whether they're\nraising them the right way\nso by saying that ADHD is caused by\nparenting Styles not only are you\nincorrect you also end up deeply hurting\nthose who are trying their best to raise\ntheir children number three you just\nneed to have self-control telling a\nperson with ADHD to have more\nself-control is like telling someone\nwith alcoholism to stop drinking it's\nnot useful and it's insensitive people\nwith ADHD tend to be inconsistent\nbecause of their symptoms they may be\nable to perform a task smoothly one day\nand face immense difficulty doing it\nagain the next but this doesn't mean\nthey have less self-control instead they\nprobably had to put in even more focus\nand effort to get the job done number\nfour I relate to you so much unless you\nhave the condition yourself you probably\ncan't fully understand what it's like\nwhile you can try to imagine what\nthey're going through by listening to\nthem and educating yourself on the topic\nsaying that you fully relate to them may\nmake it seem like you're downplaying\ntheir condition often times when you say\nthis you may be at actually relating to\nsome of their symptoms such as\nforgetfulness distractibility\nhyperactivity or and inattention but not\neveryone who shares these\ncharacteristics has ADHD people\ndiagnosed with a condition face symptoms\nthat are far more intense and recurring\nto the point where it greatly affects\ntheir own lives and relationships but if\nyou do share the same symptoms and it's\nstarting to affect your way of living\nplease visit a healthcare professional\nto get an accurate diagnosis getting\nhelp is highly important and number five\nisn't that just all in your head when\nyou ask questions like these you are\nquestioning the validity of their\ndisorder which can make you appear\ndismissive and it can also negatively\nimpact their emotions and self-esteem\nwhile ADHD is a neurodevelopmental\ndisorder it doesn't mean that it's all\nin their head according to crunkleton\nADHD causes differences in brain\nstructure function and development\nnow that we've covered what you should\ntry to avoid saying here are some things\nyou can say instead I've never\nexperienced what you're going through\nbut I understand you're in pain\ninstead of saying that you can relate to\nthem you can validate their struggle and\noffer your support to them this way\nyou're not minimizing their condition\nbut giving them a shoulder to lean on\nafter all they may have lost\nopportunities or broken relationships\nbecause of their disorder and just need\nsome support\nof course your feelings matter too so if\nyou want to express something to them\ntry to choose words that won't make them\nfeel bad about their condition up next\nis I'm here to listen\nis there something they want to talk\nabout if so they'll most likely\nappreciate the time you provide to them\nespecially if they've just gone through\na rough experience and need to let out\nsome steam when you're listening to them\nremember not to be afraid to ask\nquestions and try not to interrupt them\nas they're talking you can also say your\nstruggles are valid\nalthough mental health is more talked\nabout now there are still plenty of\npeople who are uneducated about it if\nyou know someone with a condition\nthey've probably experienced and heard a\nlot of accusations misconceptions and\ndiscriminatory or dismissive remarks\nabout it this can be pretty tough since\nit can lower their self-esteem and make\nthem question their sense of self for\nthis reason it's good to reassure them\nfrom time to time by saying that what\nthey're going through is completely\nvalid or say something like I like you\njust the way you are\nADHD currently has no cure as a result\npeople with a condition May sometimes\nexperience feelings of hopelessness so\nremember to remind them from time to\ntime that they're loved and appreciated\nfor who they are and who doesn't love\nhearing you rock did you know that\nMichael Phelps Adam Levine and Paris\nHilton have ADHD ADHD shouldn't hinder\nyou from living life to the fullest so\nbe sure to let them know that they're\namazing and that their conditions\nshouldn't stop them from doing great\nthings and going full Percy Jackson mode\nto everyone with ADHD you rock have you\never said any of these to someone with\nADHD if you have any topic suggestion or\nwant to part two to this please comment\ndown below also if you know people who\ncan resonate with this
