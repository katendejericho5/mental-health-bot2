    "transcript": "[Music]\nforeign\n[Music]\nit occurred to me that somehow I'd\ngotten through another Sunday that\nmother was now buried and tomorrow I'd\nbe going back to work as usual\nreally nothing in my life had changed\nall of us who are born into this world\nhave one thing awaiting us for certain\nit's that one day no matter how smart\nhow rich how popular we are all of our\nLives will come to an end\nthe world does not stop it'll keep\nmoving whether we're here or not the sun\nstill rises and sets the seasons come\nand go everyone in the world our friends\nour family and our loved ones will wake\nup the next day go back to work and keep\non living\n[Music]\nhow does this make you feel some people\nfind this truth very disturbing making\nthem feel very sad and even hopeless\nthis is called an existential crisis for\nthousands of years philosophers and\nwriters have written about it where they\nexperienced deep depression and sadness\nbecause of the pain they feel towards\ntheir existence and some of us may be\nexperiencing this today so what can we\ndo about this feeling\nwhile taking long walks or breathing\nexercises can help reduce your anxiety\nwe believe that a shift in perspective\nis much more important when dealing with\nexistential pain so in this existential\ncrisis series we're going to look at the\ndifferent ways that people have\nresponded to their own experience of it\nto do that we want to examine three\nperspectives that people have used to\ndeal with their existential pain\nstarting with nihilism nihilism is a\nprinciple which rejects generally\naccepted beliefs of human existence like\nmorality values and meaning it is the\nbelief that life is ultimately\nmeaningless in that trying to find\nmeaning is pointless unpopular TV shows\ncharacters like Shinji ikari Tyler\nDarden The Joker Rick and Morty often\ndisplay nihilistic behaviors while\nnihilism is often portrayed in a\nnegative light in most characters there\nare some benefits to believing that life\nultimately has no meaning because of\nthis people who are truly nihilistic are\nnot afraid of what other people normally\nfear\n[Music]\nit's only after we've lost everything\nthat we're free to do anything\npeople who are truly nihilistic are free\nfrom the everyday expectations from\nsociety and others they're not scared of\nhow others perceive them they're not\nscared to try new things and they're\ncertainly not scared of Breaking\nTraditions that most people feel\nobligated to follow to live is to risk\nit all otherwise you're just an inert\nchunk of randomly assembled molecules\ndrifting wherever the universe blows you\nof course there are some drawbacks to\nthe belief that everything is ultimately\npointless especially when someone takes\nnihilism to Extreme Measures extreme\nnihilists can potentially make\nunpredictable and often destructive\nchoices regardless of the consequences\ntheir belief rejects everything that\nmost people depend on such as Community\nlove religion and Law and Order which\nfrees them from fear of making any type\nof decision\nam I evil worse you're smart when you\nknow nothing matters the universe is\nyours\ndream dialists also believe they can do\nwhatever they want regardless of who\nmight get hurt along the way their\nactions can be Reckless which often\ncauses a lot of pain and harm to those\naround them and sometimes even to\nthemselves their belief that life is\nmeaningless can drive them to push the\ndefinition of free will in a harsh\ndestructive pattern in each of their\nworlds Rick destroys several parallel\nuniverses whenever he deems a convenient\nTyler threatens and hurts other people\nfor his pleasure The Joker terrorizes\nGotham City with his unpredictable\nnature none of them are restricted by\nculture religion or laws\nwhy some men just want to watch the\nworld burn\nnow let's be clear all these characters\nand works of fiction are often\nexaggerated for entertainment not all\nnihilists behave like this making one\nfoolish Choice after another and while\nthe belief that everything is\nmeaningless can potentially be dangerous\nit can also free you from the fear of\ntrying new things or taking risks that\nwould otherwise scare you annihilist\ncould tell you to go ask out that Crush\ntravel the world or go do the thing that\nyou always wanted to do why be afraid to\ntry new things if nothing matters in the\nend why be afraid of anything so what\nabout you would you consider yourself a\nnihilist and what do you think of this\nvideo let us know in the comments below\nif you want to see more videos like this\ndon't forget to like And subscribe\nforeign"
