too and of course we'll tell\nyou how you can resist it so without\nfurther Ado here are three ways\npersuasion can happen and how to fight\nit off so how does it work psychologist\nRobert cialdini an expert on persuasion\nspent three years studying how people\npersuade others to buy things or do\nthings in an article in Stanford's\nsocial Innovation review he says there\nare six rules to persuasion rule number\none reciprocity if someone does\nsomething for you you'll feel obligated\nto repay them 2. scarcity things seem\nmore valuable when there isn't much of\nthem or much time for example in sales\nwhen you see only five left in stock buy\nnow number three Authority there's an\nexpert or someone with authority around\nyou will often go with what they say\nnumber four consistency people are often\npressured to continue to stick with\nsomething once they've committed to it\nor made a choice\nnumber five liking people say yes to\npeople who they like or who are similar\nto them and number six social proof when\nothers are going along with something\nyou're more likely to as well Cults very\nwell mind defines persuasion as when a\nperson or entity tries to influence\nothers to change their beliefs or\nbehaviors and coercive persuasion AKA\nbrainwashing is what may occur in a cult\naccording to the New Yorker the term\nbrainwashing was used in connection with\nCults in the early 1970s some believe\nthat people join Cults in proportion to\nthe perceived uncertainty of an\nenvironment the more out of control we\nfeel our situation or our life is the\nmore likely we are to put our beliefs\ninto others and people are attracted to\nCults because it has an idealistic\nVision that's appealing and keeps people\nin them longer than you think people\nhave a hard time leaving these Cults\npossibly because of psychologist Leon\nfestinger's theory of cognitive\ndissonance he outlines how we feel\nuncomfortable or unpleasant when\nsomething contradicts our firmly held\nbeliefs psychologist Kelton Rhodes says\nthe environment or immediate situation\nexerts an overwhelming influence on our\nBehavior there doesn't seem to be any\nreliable personality trait that predicts\npeople who join Cults but there are\nsituational factors that make people\nmore susceptible such as loneliness like\nmoving to a new place depression and\nuncertainty or upheaval in life like\nstarting College these situations cause\nus to look for Simple Solutions which\nCults provide through Authority\nstructure and social closeness with\nothers these are all things that most of\nus look for in our lives without\nrealizing it according to psychologist\nand cult expert Margaret thailer Singer\nCults Thrive when Society is in\nturbulent periods such as social and\npolitical unrest and when the rules and\nstructure of society have broken down\nadvertising according to the guardian\ncompanies use persuasion to get you to\nbuy things by making you think you're\ngetting a bargain when you're really not\nsneaky right is it a high price on\npurpose and then put it on sale so you\nthink you're getting a deal but really\nthe company is getting the price they\noriginally wanted they also make you\nwant to buy more things by having a\nscarcity rule in place you know those\npopular shopping websites when they\nadvertise there are only five left in\nstock it persuades you to buy the item\nbecause this might be your last chance\nto get it before it's all gone\nadvertising companies urging people to\nbuy things is persuasion it has a\npowerful influence on our daily lives\nand Society in general Authority when it\ncomes down to it we respect people who\nare experts we're influenced by\ntoothpaste that says dentist recommended\nbecause dentists are experts and so we\ntrust their recommendations\nit saves us time and energy when we\ndon't have to be an expert on a subject\nand can rely on those who already are\nand if the item you got wasn't as good\nas you were told then you also have\nsomeone to blame it on psychologist\nStanley Milgram famous for his\nwell-known shock experiments discovered\nthat we're all surprisingly obedient to\nthose in a position of authority\naccording to Simply psychology in part\nobedience involves a hierarchy of power\nso the person ordering you to do\nsomething has a higher status than you\nreceiving the order how to resist it\naccording to psychology today not every\npersuasion technique will work every\ntime it depends on the context and\nrequires careful planning but simply\nknowing these principles of persuasion\ncan help you not only become more\npersuasive for yourself but to recognize\nwhen you're being influenced and just a\nreminder from very well mind that\npersuasion isn't all negative it can be\nused for good like getting people to\nrecycle or improve their health by\nquitting smoking learning more about\npersuasion can help you be more\npersuasive too research has shown that\nhaving a confident tone of voice makes\nyou more persuasive even if you don't\nfeel like you are sounding like you are\nwill make people more likely to go along\nwith what you're saying\nas the father of influence Robert\ncialdini says understanding the rules of\ninfluence how they work and how to use\nthem can help you be more persuasive and\navoid
