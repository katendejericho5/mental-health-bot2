a bunch of this I\nlove this energy\nall right so let's get started\nso\nfirst of all let's start with this\nyou're more than welcome to journal\nabout this so after the stream what I\nwill do actually is create\num a bullet point of all these questions\njust in case you didn't get to like\nJournal fully or you want to reflect\nback and like go into your own\nexperience even deeper on your own but\ntoday you're more than welcome to type\ndirectly onto the live stream chat or\nyou can you know journal on your own\nit's completely up to you\nso let's think about last year\ntake a moment to reflect on the last\nyear all the experiences all the places\nyou've gone maybe all the people you've\nmet\nall the achievements like just take a\nmoment to like really think about where\nyou were in the last 365 days\nwhat a year it's been\nand the first question that I want to\nask you which most of you are probably\nnot surprised by if you know me\nif you've been on some of these live\nstreams if you've watched any of my\nYouTube videos you knew that this is\nsomething that I'm really really excited\nabout geek out about number one is what\nare you most grateful for from last year\nyou can list about one to three things\nin the chat if you would like\nto mention a few things I can probably\ngo on and on about what I'm grateful for\num and though from last year there's\nsome really cool things that happen\nfirst of all and when I reflect on it\nit's actually all about experiences and\npeople as it's probably not that\nsurprising\nnumber one is\num I am grateful that my mom actually\ncame and visited me when I was in\nCalifornia last year\nwhich was a very beautiful experience to\nget to really connect with our\num you know it was\num very vulnerable in the sense that we\ngot to really talk about things that we\nhadn't talked about before we didn't\nhave the courage to talk about so that\nwas really really something I'm grateful\nfor because she took the time to come\nvisit me as well as we got to create\nthis beautiful experience where we got\nto connect better connect deeper\nspeaking of people I'm actually really\ngrateful for psych to go and the CEO of\npsycho I actually been working with him\nfor the last couple years\num as his coach and I actually finally\ngot to meet him he's amazing you guys I\nfinally got to meet him in Seoul Korea\nof all places because he happened to be\nthere when I was there we got to meet in\nperson which was so cool because you\nknow in this world where we get to do a\nlot of things virtually which is\nincredible it's also really really cool\nto be able to meet in person\nand by the way that might be an omen for\num what's to come with psych2go in the\nfuture soon because\nthere might be some experiences where we\nget to incorporate more of the in-person\nexperience\nnot gonna say much more than that but\nthat might be a thing that's coming up\nso anyway what are you guys most\ngrateful for from last year take a\nmoment to not only just think about it\nbut like connect to that deep gratitude\nof what's what's there for you\nI'm seeing all sorts of things that\npeople are sharing I'm grateful for\nmusic I'm grateful for family I'm\ngrateful for friends I'm grateful for\num all of this so that's great\ngrateful for your partner your friends\nyour mom I love that I love this you're\ngrateful for music\num love this\nso feel that energy shift as everyone\nhere talking about what they're grateful\nfor this is the power of gratitude you\nguys so simple so available for you at\nall times and has the it has the power\nto shift our energy from whatever\nfear-based emotion to immediately\nabundant\npowerful emotion and state so know that\nthat's possible\nso now let's go on to number two from\nlast year\nI love that somebody just said I'm\ngrateful for myself I love that so much\nyes yes yes\nnumber two you guys\nwhat are you most proud of\nwhat are you most proud of oftentimes\nyou know there's been um it's this\nphenomenon where we tend to\nover\num acknowledge other people for their\nwins and successes and as human beings\nit's actually very common for us to\nunder acknowledge ourselves so over\num you know over acknowledge other\npeople for their successes and wins but\nwe're not acknowledging ourselves enough\nso take this moment right now what do\nyou most grateful for I'm sorry proud of\nfrom last year\num one thing I am really proud of is\num the moments that I really listen to\nmy heart\nand I said yes to a lot of experiences\nwithout knowing exactly how it's gonna\ngo\nand they always turned out amazing\num I've traveled to different places\nI actually kind of moved to Asia again\nso for those of you who know me I've\nbeen living in Korea um in 2020 2021\nwent back to California now I'm here so\nso\num\nyeah I'm really proud of that actually\none more thing\num I had the honor of\nI have the owner of officiating My Best\nFriend's Wedding so I was really proud\nof that and even though I'm a speaker\num that was actually something that was\na little bit nerve-wracking for me\nbecause it meant so much to me\nso I'm really proud of those experiences\nwhat are you guys proud of\nokay I'm proud of understanding what's\ngoing on with you wow thank you safe to\ngo thank you for saying that\nproud of passing your French class I'm\nproud of my skill and passion of art\nproud of you yes that's amazing\nwhat are you most proud of\nand here's the thing these aren't you\nknow out of the world questions these\nare pretty simple questions the y'alls\ncan access at any time\nyou can also utilize these questions on\na daily basis to work on your mindset\nyou know it's just like working out it's\njust like you know taking care of our\nbodies through our diet it's not about\nwhat we know it's about what we do\nbecause a lot of times we already know\nwhat's going to make us have healthy and\nhappy and fit we just don't put in the\neffort the discipline and the habits so\nsome of these questions you can utilize\non a daily basis if you would like\nall right you guys\nso thank you for sharing what you're\nproud of\nand again take take a note of this\nfeeling for a second what does it feel\nto be proud\nbecause when we talk about these\nfeelings and emotions\nIt's actually an experience that's\nhappening within our bodies nowhere else\nit's not happening outside of us we\noften look for external validation we\noften look for the feelings as if it's\ncoming from the outside world but at the\nend of the day when we have these\nfeelings of gratitude when we have these\nfeelings of being proud it's literally\ncoming from within\nit's literally coming from our own\nselves our own limbs our own organs our\nown bodies\nwhich actually means that it never has\nto be\nabout anything else anyone else outside\nof us we have the power to shift into\nthese feelings at any time we like just\nby asking some really simple questions\nand Powerful questions\nthis is something that I jam on with my\nclients often which is that the\num you know we get to ask better\nquestions\nto have a better mindset\nI think Tony Robbins talks about this\nthe quality of Our Lives is really the\nquality of the questions that we're\nasking ourselves internally as well as\nexternally\nif we keep asking ourselves like why do\nI feel so awful why does my life suck\nthen no matter how you answer that your\nbrain is going to automatically go into\nthis place of our brain is nothing but\nlike an answering machine like it just\nwants to pump out answers\nhowever if you start asking questions\nlike what am I most proud of right now\nwhat am I most grateful for what's\nreally amazing About Me by simply\nchoosing better questions you can lead\nyourself into a better mindset better\nemotional and energetic State\nimmediately\nyou can start the day saying like what's\ngoing to go well today\nwhat amazing things could happen today\nand then your brain starts to go into\nthis place\num in Neuroscience it's called reticular\nactivating system where our brain is\nprimed to look for things that we're\nfocusing on\nso if you can simply direct your\nattention direct your questions in a\npowerful way it's actually easier than\nyou think to have a really powerful\nmindset\nawesome TSM thank you for asking that\nquestion for the rest of us\num so that everyone knows what the\nquestion is they'll take us here too so\nquestion number one what are you most\ngrateful form\nquestion number two what are you\nmost proud of\nyou all right\nlet's go to number three\nso we're talking about you know some\nthings that we're grateful for some\nthings we're proud of number three we're\ngonna focus on\nwhat habits\nor mindsets or thought processes can you\nlet go of from last year when you think\nabout what happened last year what are\nsome habits\nor thought processes or mindsets can you\nlet go of\nthat would better your life this year\nwhat happens\nprincess\nand you let go of to have a better years\nthis year\nso for me some habits\nbut I can certainly let go of\nis\num I have this tendency and I don't know\nif any of y'alls do this I have this\ntendency to look at my phone\nbefore I go to bed\nand I'm aware that right before we go to\nbed is when our brain is you know taking\nin stuff taking in information that's\ngoing to replay overnight so whatever we\nread lasts whatever we feel last\noftentimes will continue for the next\neight hours or however long you sleep\nand sometimes our brain continues to\nprocess that\nso I know that this is really important\num and I know that taking an hour off\nfrom any kind of light including phone\nincluding computer can extremely\num better my sleep quality\nso I am willing to let go of that habit\nof looking at my phone lasting before I\ngo to bed\num one other thing let's see what else\ncan I let go of\num\nwhat I can also let go of\nis\nany kind of expectations\nthat I sometimes put on things or people\nand just accepting things as they are\naccepting people as they are exactly as\nthey are\nand this I think for me comes up often\nwith my closest Family\nfor some reason\nI don't know if any of y'all's you know\nresonate with that I'm actually really\nreally good at accepting people as they\nare in you know friendships or clients\nstrangers and for some reason it's so\nmuch like we're prone to set these\nexpectations on our family members\npeople closest to us our parents right\nMom Dad whatever\nso that's one thing I want to let go\nmore of what are you wanting to let go\nof what habits or mindset or beliefs\nthat would better your life in 2023\nnumber four who can you forgive\nand it's actually a two-part question\nwho can you forget from last year\nand\nhow\nwould that feel to completely forget\nthat person\nwho can you forgive from last year\nand\nforeign\nand what would that feel like to\ncompletely let go\nof that feeling\nor of that person so what would be that\nfeeling of Letting Go or forgiving that\nperson\nand by the way I don't know if you all\nknow about the hope and open of prayer\num I actually have a video on my channel\nand my YouTube channel\num I'll go ahead and put it in my\ncaption where\num it's almost like a Hawaii it's a\nHawaiian prayer that allows you to\nreally let go and forgive it's a really\nreally powerful prayer\num and I've had like literally hundreds\nof people crying from it releasing some\nenergies from the past and really\nclearing the slave for for their you\nknow own own self so if you guys are\ninterested I'll go and put that in the\ncaptions\num and some people are saying you know\ncertain people your friend\num your family and some people are\nsaying yourself\nthese are all great and by the way you\nguys as you move through this there's no\nright or wrong answers there's no good\nor bad answers these are just answers\nwe're co-creating this experience as we\ngo there's nothing to judge about it\nbecause oftentimes I go into this\nReflection State and then we start\njudging ourselves or judging others or\nwhatever so let go of that layer just\nsee what's there for you today\nand there are certain people that um you\nknow I can think of that I have already\nforgiven I actually did this particular\nexercise right before the new year and I\nreally just let go and like for me what\nthat felt like was which is why I added\nthat additional question\nwhich is\num when I decided to forgive these\npeople first of all I was surprised how\neasy it was like easier it was than I\nthought when I just said you know what\nI'm gonna decide I'm gonna commit to\nforgiving that person it was like easy\nand then what it felt like for me was it\nfelt light it felt like I could float I\ncould be playful again I could be myself\nagain it felt so light and just so um\nPleasant\nand it's so funny because that's\ntypically the feeling that we get I\ndon't know about y'alls but when we\ndecide to forgive somebody that's how it\nfeels and we think that by holding on to\nthis Grudge it's gonna impact that\nperson negatively and most of the time\nthe only person that it's really\nimpacting negatively is ourselves and\nour own energetic States\nso focus on that who can you forgive and\nwhat would that feel like to forgive\nand then last question reflecting on\nlast year which is actually perfect so\nwe're at the 30 minutes mark what can\nyou forgive about yourself from last\nyear\nwe're often the most critical\nof ourselves\nand some people already said when I\nasked who can you forgive from last year\nyou all said yourselves\nso what are you willing to forgive\nat yourself from last year\nthank you being too critical of yourself\nyes\nyou can forgive yourself for your\nlaziness okay yes let that go\nyou can forgive yourself\nyeah take a moment I see that some of\nyou guys are really reflecting I love\nthis forgive yourself for your actions\nyeah\nyour shyness yes forgive yourself for\nbeing too clingy yes for being hard on\nyourself for saying that you're ugly yes\nlet go\nfor being jealous of others and you know\nwhat this is what's really beautiful\nabout the stream and what's being\ncreated right now\nas you guys are saying this I can\nresonate with literally every single one\nof these\nthat I probably felt at one point too\nand it's so funny because we think we're\nso unique\nin some of these things that we judge\nourselves for that were critical about\nourselves about but when you look at\nthis list\nI really wouldn't be surprised it's like\n90 of these things you can really really\nresonate for if not all of them\nwhich actually brings us back to my\ninitial intention that we set which is\nthat this is a community meaning we are\nactually all very very similar more than\nweek week\nwe're actually all just humans\nwe're all earthlings on this planet and\nwe actually experience probably a set\nsame set of emotions\nin a given time\nand whatever you felt\nhow do we stop judging ourselves\nself-based on past guilt well first\nthing is to stop judging yourself on\njudging yourself meaning can you just\nacknowledge yourself when you have if\nyou have any of these like guilt or\nshame that come up which by the way is a\nvery Universal emotion\ncan you just be like not can you just\nacknowledge yourself for being a healthy\nhuman who has wider range right array of\nemotions start there how can you stop\nhating yourself well start there\nacknowledge yourself for having these\nemotions at all like that's actually not\na bad thing\nI'm getting paid nothing to do this I'm\nliterally here because I love you guys\nand I'm not joking I like love this\ncommunity so much it's such an honor to\nbe here\num and my clients know this some of\ny'alls probably know this one thing I\ntruly believe in is the law of\num giving\nwhich is that when we give freely things\ncome back to us freely and I like this\nis a part of what I get to do this is a\npart of what I feel like I get to\ncontribute to the world and I'm so so so\nso grateful to be here and I'm so\ngrateful that you guys are here so\nsomebody just asked us so that's why I\nanswered\nthis is what you guys to know about I'm\nhere because I genuinely love this\ncommunity what psycho stands for I love\num all the people that work so hard for\npsych2go\num and we're here because we want to\nmake a difference\nall right okay so those are the five\nquestions you guys\nto let go of last year\nand we're going to do something a little\nfun here\nwhich is now we get to really let go of\nlast year\nif you\nwrote this on a piece of paper\nas a symbol of what we're doing\nyou can rip this up if you want you can\nburn it later if you want like really\nlet go create a ritual around this for\nyourself be careful if you're playing\nwith fire but um\ndon't say that I told you to do that be\ncareful out there but do whatever you're\ngonna just rip it up throw it in there\nthrow it in the trash whatever\nbut create something that will allow you\nto let it go let go of last year create\nspace for the new year\nand like take a moment you guys to like\nliterally shake off last year\nwhatever that means whatever it looks\nlike just like Shake It Off\nenergetically like and I know this\nsounds silly but I do this in the shower\nsometimes like literally pretend that\nyou're like shaking things off that are\nenergetic that's no longer serving you\njust like let them go leave it behind in\nthe last chair\nand Let It Go Shake It Off shake it off\nand literally literally move your body\nthis is actually a powerful energy\nshifting experience shake it off all\nright\nthank you\nokay like shake it off all right all\nright all right okay\nso now we are literally stepping into\nthe new year are you guys ready\nand for those of you who yeah Dana said\nshe can shake it off yes yes love it for\nthose of you who's just joining asking\nme who I am my name is Yuri Choi\num I am here we're doing\num a 60 Minute experience where we get\nto really let go of last year and step\ninto the new year powerfully so thank\nyou for being here\num and we're gonna step into creating\nthe next year now so we just went\nthrough five powerful questions to\nacknowledge and let go of last year\nand like I said that felt so satisfying\nsomebody said about shaking it off\nperfect\num\nnow\nif you guys want I do invite you to go\ndeeper on this on your own put some like\nyou know soft music on maybe do some\nyoga meditation before if you want and\nlike really go into the journaling if\nyou want\nand I love that you guys are sharing in\nthe

one is abundance\nI am so passionate about creating\nabundance actually I don't want to say\ncreate because abundance is actually\nalready everywhere\nit's up to us to live in an abundant\nmindset to see the abundance that's\nalready available to us\nand I'm so passionate about bringing\npeople to that mindset where they get to\nfeel abundant\nso that's one of my words my second word\nis
