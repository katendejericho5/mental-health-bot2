    "transcript": "why is this life why am I Born into this\nworld what is my purpose is it to serve\nothers or to be served live and create\nor Die With Honor or to become an\nadventurous astronaut who will\neventually fight aliens and save the\nuniverse\ntoo much huh we all have our share of\nexistential crisis and still stumble on\nwith this mere search for meaning and\npurpose so let us make it simple for you\nwhat if we say your constant search for\nmeaning is the healthy way to lead a\npurposeful life oops did we just give\naway the answer right away actually yes\nbut no it's deeper than that\none we all want to be of some\nsignificance We crave to be special it's\npartly true and partially not but the\nQuest for uniqueness stays with us in\neverything we do and that's when we see\ncreation creation and Adventure fulfill\na purpose by leaving the world a better\nplace than we found it\ntwo by serving others it could be\nhelping your mother with her chores or\nmaybe even fighting in the world war 10.\nthe more you help the more inner\nsatisfaction you attain it might sound\ncontradicting for someone who just wants\nto be a billionaire and go on an\nexpensive vacation but you will not make\nthose billions without being of service\nand three we find meaning in forming\ngood and fruitful human connections okay\nyes also with adorable dogs and cats we\nthrive on social connections and get\ndepressed when the loneliness gets us a\nsingle strong relationship can make you\na stronger person than any Popeye\nspinach could guys we constantly tend to\nlook for peace and purpose juggling\nbetween these three factors knowingly or\nunknowingly we are unique beings just\nlike any other wonderful living things\nout there but we have a gift for hunting\nnew experiences we all are Indiana Jones\nin a way embrace it and remember to\nnever stop your inner search\nforeign\n[Music]"
