    "transcript": "and therapist Carl Young once said until\nyou learn to make the unconscious\nconscious it will direct your life and\nyou will call it fate his work and many\nothers in the field reflects this desire\nwe all have to delve deeper into our\nunconscious and understand the parts of\nourselves that shape a lot of our views\nand actions without us even realizing it\nbut while it might not be the first\nthing that comes to mind when talking\nabout this topic did you know that past\ntrauma can be one of these unconscious\ninfluences while the American\nPsychological Association defines trauma\nas life-threatening experiences trauma\nis about more than just finding yourself\nin a seriously dangerous life or death\nsituation it can also come from the\nexperiences of loss or psychological and\nemotional abuse and if left unresolved\nthis trauma can manifest in a lot of\nnegative cognitive behavioral or even\npsychological ways so with that said\nhere are seven ways your past trauma may\nstill be hurting you in the present\nnumber one you have anger management\nproblems when we think of someone who is\ntraumatized or still struggling with the\npsychological wounds of their past we\noften picture them as despondent anxious\nor even depressed but anger is also a\ncommon but often overlooked sign of this\ntoo especially among men so if you have\na history of Anger Management problems\nbut don't quite know why or feel that\nyou can't help it it might be because of\nan unconscious desire to suppress or\ndisplace your emotional distress from\nunresolved trauma number two you\nstruggle with intrusive thoughts those\nwho have been exposed to a traumatic\nexperience especially if left unresolved\nare highly at risk of post-traumatic\nstress disorder or PTSD and one of the\nmost telltale signs of post-traumatic\nstress is having intrusive thoughts\nwhich are recurring unwanted thoughts\noften related in some way to the trauma\nthat are extremely distressing in nature\nthese are often accompanied by strong\nfeelings of guilt and anxiety and can\nalso manifest as nightmares or\nflashbacks number three your emotional\nintelligence needs Improvement defined\nas the ability to understand and\nregulate own and others behaviors\nemotional intelligence or EQ for short\nis an important determinant of a\nperson's mental well-being self-esteem\nrelationship satisfaction and overall\nquality of life people who have a high e\nQ tend to achieve success realize their\nfull potential and have more positive\nrelationships with themselves and others\nunresolved trauma however can decrease a\nperson's self-awareness ability to\nregulate their emotions and ability to\nrelate to and connect with others which\nwould reflect a low EQ that needs\nImprovement number four you have\naddictive Tendencies psychologists have\nfound that some people tend to be at\ngreater risk for developing addictions\nbe it substance addictions or behavioral\naddictions such as gambling shopping\ngaming compulsive eating ere exercising\nor even gossip drama and relationships\nbecause of certain personality traits\nlike low self-control and a high need\nfor excitement and behavioral patterns\nthese behavioral patterns are called\naddictive Tendencies and they're often\ntriggered by traumatic experiences that\ncause us to cope in problematic and\nmaladaptive ways number five you have\navoidant\nTendencies next is having avoidant\nTendencies which is common for people\nwho have experienced trauma the most\ncommon examples of these are social\nwithdrawal I.E canceling plans and just\nbeing by oneself most of the time and\nemotional withdrawal I.E pushing people\naway feeling emotionally numb these\navoidant Tendencies tend to manifest\nbecause of a desire to avoid anything\nthat reminds them of the past and avoid\nany intense emotions that may arise\nbecause of it number six you have poor\nor unfulfilling relationships similar to\nthe last point one Telltale sign that\nyour past is still hurting you in the\npresent is if you struggle with\nunfulfilling poor quality relationships\nthis can mean that your relationships\nlack meaning an emotional connection or\nthat you have difficulty maintaining\nthem in the long term because of a\ntendency to\nself-sabotage either way this fear of\nemotional vulnerability and weariness to\nget close to others is likely to stem\nfrom a previous traumatic experience in\nyour life that you have not come to\nterms with and number seven you have a\nfear or distrust of happiness finally\nbut perhaps most importantly a strong\nfear or distrust of happiness is as\nclear a red flag as any that there is\nstill some emotional baggage in your\nlife that you need to unpack now while\nit might sound confusing to some why\nwould anyone have a fear of being happy\nthose of us who have been through a\ntraumatic experience in our past and\nstruggled with our mental health can\nsurely relate in fact studies show that\nvictims of trauma often have a hard time\nletting go of their past and struggle to\nmove forward with their lives as crazy\nas it may sound these people find\ncomfort in their pain because it's what\nfeels most familiar to them and that's\nwhy we keep coming back to it and\nhappiness genuine lasting happiness\nfeels terrifying and unfamiliar to\nsomeone who suffered so much for so\nlong so do you relate to any of the\nthings we've mentioned here if you are\nstruggling with your mental health or\nliving with unresolved trauma please\ndon't hesitate to reach out to a mental\nhealth care professional it may not\nhappen as easily or as quickly as we'd\nlike and it will surely be a painful\nEndeavor but overcoming our past trauma\nallows us to no longer be defined by it\nas Helen Keller once said yes the world\nis full of suffering but it is also full\nof the overcoming of it so what\nmountains will you be conquering"
