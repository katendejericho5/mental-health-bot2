those who are always\nworking always productive and always on\nthe go however this could be more\nharmful than beneficial this can leave\nus feeling like we're lazy if we're not\ndoing something that can be labeled as\nproductive in actuality you may not be\nlazy at all instead this could actually\nbe a warning sign that your mental\nhealth is declining so here are six\nsigns you're struggling with your mental\nhealth not laziness\nnumber one doing nothing isn't normal\nfor you\nthere are a lot of reasons why someone\nmay want to do nothing for the day maybe\nyou have a lot going on at school or\nwork or you need a day of self-care\nthese are all normal and healthy reasons\nfor wanting a quiet day to yourself\nlaziness on the other hand is having\nthings to do and not caring to do them\neven though you have the energy or time\nother Devin Price writes about how he\nwas always put together organized\ndiligent little worker bee to anyone\nlooking in however he put himself into a\nposition where he'd feel guilty for\nspending any recharge time this could be\ndue to poor mental health awareness or\neven a toxic childhood environment where\nyou were taught that you were valued for\nwhat you do rather than who you are next\ntime you have a lazy day make a list of\nall the work you've done to show\nyourself how deserved your rest time\nreally is\nnumber two\nthings that you once did easily are more\nof a tornow mental health isn't linear\nif you're an anime fan you may know a\nguy named Naruto Uzumaki he loves eating\nRamen and could have a bowl for every\nmeal every day the last thing he wants\nto do is be stuck in a classroom if you\ntold him to study even on his best day\nhe might drag his feet but if Naruto\ndeclined Ramen on a bad mental health\nday we wouldn't call him lazy for not\nwanting to get some you'd be more\ninclined to see if he's okay when you\nhave a day where you can't do much of\nanything ask yourself does this thing\nbother me normally when you're feeling a\nbit off ask yourself what needs to be\ndone if it's something you normally\ndon't like take some recharge time if\nyou notice you're ditching your normal\nroutine and it's affecting your daily\nlife please reach out to a mental health\nprofessional to get extra support number\nthree You're motivated but you lack\nenergy it's your day off you have a list\nof errands but you can't seem to get\nstarted do you have the motivation to do\nthem but not the energy this is the big\ndefining factor between laziness and\nmental health when you're being lazy you\ndon't have any motivation to do anything\nno matter what it is however if you have\na list of things to do that you actually\nwant or need to get done but can't seem\nto this is a sign of mental health\ndecline the motivation to complete the\ntask is there the energy may not be take\nsome time for a self-check-in and real\nrecharge time\nnumber four you're always scrolling when\nyou have things to do when you're with\npeople or when you have things to do do\nyou notice yourself for treating into\nyour phone\nthis is a huge sign of mental health\nconcern not laziness you may still want\nto be present with your friends or start\nthat to-do list but just can't seem to\nbe able to\nthis doesn't mean you're lazy not\nwanting to be present and wanting to\nseclude yourself are self-soothing\ncoping mechanisms we do when we feel\nuncomfortable if you find yourself doing\nthis try to put your phone down for five\nminutes then try again for 10 and see\nhow you feel number five\nyou don't feel anything\nwhen you're struggling with mental\nhealth it can be very difficult to keep\nup with normal life and tasks falling\nbehind would normally stress someone out\nand cause them to rush to complete all\nof their tasks but when you're\nstruggling with mental health you may\nnot feel that Panic that a deadline\nbrings you may not care that you haven't\neaten or drank any water speaking of\nwhich grab a sip right now\nyou may not even care that you haven't\nshowered in days this is a huge red flag\nyou might want to make an appointment to\ntalk with a mental health professional\nand number six you find yourself\ndaydreaming most of your day away\ndo you frequently Daydream to the point\nwhere it gets in the way of your\nday-to-day life a 2017 study connected\nmaladaptive daydreaming with
