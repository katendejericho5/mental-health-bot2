over your\nshoulder asking you what you're working\non a few times every hour this is\nmicromanaging and it can make you feel\nlike you're under a microscope all hours\nof the day I don't know about you but\nthat's not how I want to feel when I'm\nat home with my partner I want to feel\ncomfortable enough to walk around in my\nfuzzy Chewbacca onesie sipping on my cup\nof noodles while singing show tunes with\nno judgment\nmedical author and psychiatrist Roxanne\nDryden Edwards MD agrees too in her\narticle about obsessive love on medicine\nnet she explains how a partner who loves\nyou obsessively can attempt to control\nwhat and when you eat what you spend\nyour money on and how much you spend\nsometimes where you go and who you're\nhanging out with this controlling\nBehavior shows

sweet\nnothings sex therapist and licensed\nsocial worker Janet Britto PhD lcw CST\nStates in her Healthline article that\nlove bombing doesn't even have to be\nwords it can be showering you with gifts\nfancy dates blowing up your phone with\ncalls and texts convincing you that you\nare meant to be or even pushing the\nrelationship forward not saying this is\nthe case for everyone but does anyone\nhave a friend who met someone and was\nengaged in six months or less This Could\nBe Love bombing and this could be a sign\nof obsessive not healthy love 4.\nignoring responsibilities\nthe honeymoon phases filled with puppy\nlove and lots of being together like we\nsaid this is totally normal but it's\nalso normal for these intense feelings\nto fade like Lily and Marshall from How\nI Met Your Mother as they mature the\nrelationship matures with them in the\nheart so they think in a healthy\nrelationship instead of having that need\nto go be with your partner you're able\nto prioritize and get your to-do list\nchecked off then go be with your partner\nif you and your partner are out of that\nhoneymoon phase a craving to be together\nmay be a sign of obsessive love many\nsymptoms of obsessive love disorder such\nas ignoring others boundaries\nintolerance of distance between them and\ntheir loved one need for constant\ncontact in person or digitally number\nfive intense emotions have you ever\nheard the phrase the crime fits the\npunishment well emotions should fit the\nsituation if your partner accidentally\nate your leftovers that you were\nthinking about all day sure being\nfrustrated and annoyed is understandable\nhowever this shouldn't be an enough fuel\nto fire up an all-out screaming match\nwhen someone is experiencing obsessive\nlove disorder their emotions regarding\ntheir loved one can be just as\ndisproportionate if they're unable to be\nwith or speak to you this might bring\nout really intense emotions like anger\njealousy or emotional

emotions towards\nsomeone else other mental illnesses that\nhave a similar Focus can cause obsessive\nlove disorder as a symptom\nlet's take borderline personality\ndisorder or BPD for example Timothy J\nLegg PhD and Saidi at Healthline reminds\nus that BPD is characterized by severe\nmood swings and a negative self-image\nbased on a chemical imbalance in the\nbrain these mood swings can be directed\nsolely at your partner if you feel\ninadequate in the relationship which may\ncause you to feel good one day and then\nangry at anything they do another day\nagain just because you already have a\ndiagnosis doesn't mean you also have\nobsessive love disorder but it could be\nsomething to explore with a mental\nhealth professional a healthy nurturing\nand positive relationships are the goal\nfor everyone sure we want our partner to\nbe a little addicted to us a clinical\nObsession can be serious have you ever\nbeen in a relationship where your\npartner may have been
