    "transcript": "hey there let's have a talk let's have a\ndiscussion these sound pretty good right\nyou're excited because someone cares\nabout what you think communication is\nall important\ncare and be care about still too often\nthe discussion which is a two-way\nsharing of information devolves into an\nargument emotions rise each side digging\ntheir heels in harder until they're\nhearing but not listening to the other\nside further escalation means a blow up\nthe results of which are damaged\nemotions and no Solutions or greater\nunderstanding so how do you get your\npoint across yet not start a war let's\ntake a look at a few ways to approach\nthe argument and bring it back to\nhealthy Communication number one keep\nthe temperature even emotions are human\nand we can keep them in check not doing\nso cripples communication a a certain\nwidely broadcasted political debate from\nSeptember 29 2020 is an example of this\nHint it involved the phrase will you\nshut up man that wasn't calm and it\ndidn't result in anything useful other\nthan maybe some entertainment when the\nfeeling Spike we perceive a threat from\nthe other person we go into fight or\nflight and emotions Will trump logic no\npun intended it's like that kid sticking\ntheir fingers in their ears shouting I\ncan't hear you\ncommunication is dead let's take a deep\nbreath to calm and ground you slowing\ndown and pausing while speaking reduces\nthe threat impression like cool water\nmeaning a feverish forehead this allows\nthe other person to open up in kind also\noccasionally the statement asks like a\nquestion gives a sense of inviting the\nother person to share their views\nfurther de-escalating the situation\nafter all how things are said is just as\nimportant as what is being said if not\nmore so number two have a sense of humor\nincluding about yourself a glass Cannon\nfires shots but can't take any back\nwithout exploding don't be a glass\nCannon enforced one-way Shot firing is\nbullying humor can break the tension or\nawkwardness that is causing Minds to\nclose and anger or hurt feelings to\nharass it makes you more persuasive\nsince it sends a message of hey I'm on\nyour side I'm friendly and can laugh\nwith them it can remind the other person\nthat no matter what the topic is now\nthere's more to you than just this\nconversation or argument of course this\ndoes require care having a good feel of\nwhat is appropriate and when if comedic\ntiming has not your superpower maybe let\nothers initiate number three ask\nquestions and listen carefully this is a\nsuch an accurate quote we're gonna share\nit with you most people do not lesson\nwith the intent to understand they\nlisten with the intent to reply Stephen\nR Covey we all do it even with the best\nintentions selectively listening only to\nthe parts you want to respond to means\nyou're making assumptions to fill in the\nparts that were ignored the other person\nfeels invalidated and that they were\nlured into speaking solely to be stepped\non and used for your own ends Q argument\ngoing nowhere to win in this situation\nregardless of what kind of questions you\nask you do have to listen to the other\nperson with the intent of understanding\nwhere they are coming from and from\ntheir point of view this will reveal\nbetter information to use with no\nassumptions to muddy it up your goal\nwill determine the kinds of questions to\nask understanding to bond or sparking a\ndebate if it's a reach for understanding\nyou can try the Socratic method start\nwith a validation and end with a\nquestion it's clear you've heard them\nand you want to know about an\ninconsistency maybe they have the answer\nif you want to get a lively debate going\nyou can get more provocative and\nchallenging posing hypothetical\nquestions and directly challenging their\npoints number four realize and accept\nyou might be wrong the conundrum of\nBeing Human we want to know everything\nand some of us act like we do know\neverything but no one actually does\noccasionally you'll find out you weren't\nwrong per se just the other party was at\nconspiracies at levels of belief where\nlogic facts and evidence hold no power\ngood news that's a release you don't\nneed to waste your precious time anymore\nyou can just walk away and smile while\nyou do it other times though we are\nactually wrong we get it our pride has\nbeen dealt a blow especially if the\nother person is delicate about it and\nthat is okay in fact it means you were\ngifted a shiny new bit of information\nthe other person is still in the same\nplace but they shared with you soy be\nnice as a bonus graciously admitting you\nwere wrong and showing a willingness to\nlearn is a testament to your awesomeness\nit means new knowledge doesn't break you\nit allows you to grow exercise\nflexibility and change number five\nAgreements are not forbidden labeling\nthe exchange as an argument connotes the\nneed to win it implies a mighty battle\nwhere the other side must concede and\nbow before you\n[Music]\ngot carried away there the point we're\nmaking is that it doesn't need to be\nthis way healthy communication involves\nboth give and take dishing out only\nrebuttal and rejection makes people feel\nattacked even if it's backed by Logic\nthey will dig in agreements though even\npartial ones show them that their\nmessage matters and your listening\nfinding that small island of Common\nGround can be critical to being able to\nprogress without Bloodshed enter the yes\nand or yes also type of statements this\nvalidates them and also invites moving\nforward with the discussion even if\nnothing they say agrees with you\ndirectly you could recognize that\nthey're coming from a good place with\ngood intentions validating their rights\nto their beliefs number six research and\nuse facts this is as much for yourself\nas for the arguments debate or\ndiscussion the research allows you\ncomfort in knowledge and allows you to\napply facts to the argument facts help\nto to defuse emotional arguments\nreplacing them with logic being\ncomfortable and knowledgeable further\nincreases your ability to identify\ninconsistencies contradictions and\nassumptions from the other person they\nmight be basing their stance on\ninaccurate information your knowledge\nbased on facts lets you respond\naccordingly and come out on top cool\ncollected and correct number seven\nappeal to higher values make it\nmeaningful to the person or people\nyou're talking with logic and facts are\ngreat to give you credibility but people\ntend to stop listening when they're\nbored or can't relate so a little\nemotion is okay and more importantly a\nrelatable angle where your stance wants\nwhat they want helps immensely we've all\nseen that celebrity or politician whose\narguments are nonsense but their\ndelivery has given them a massive\nfollowing where they say things like\nshouldn't we all be working to make the\nworld better and safer for our children\nor we want to and can be better people\nright so imagine what could happen if\nyou do have something meaningful and can\nappeal to the other side we all win some\nand lose some and remember if you win\ndon't be a soul winner rubbing it in\npeople's faces or doing a touchdown\nvictory dance to mock them that's a sure\nway to not make friends you're better\nthan that when with respect humility\nunderstanding and kindness after all no\none knows everything and you might as\nwell be on the non-winning side next\ntime which one of these techniques have\nyou tried in the past if any how did it\ngo feel free to discuss and comment we\npromise we're not arguing with you we\njust want to hear from you and have you\nlike us thanks for watching see you next\ntime"
