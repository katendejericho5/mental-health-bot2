if you should here are\nseven signs you should ask them out and\nhow to do so number one they look at you\noften do you catch your crush staring at\nyou from time to time this is a common\nway to tell if someone has a crush on\nyou in an article for psychology today\nBehavioral Analyst John R Jack Schaefer\nPhD explains that people look at people\nthey like and avoid looking at people\nthey don't like Schaefer goes on to say\nthat the neurochemical oxytocin may be\nresponsible for increased eye contact\nelevated oxytocin levels increase mutual\nalgaes and provide a sense of well-being\nwhich increases mutual attraction most\noften people want to take a peek at\ntheir Crush from time to time when they\ndo so they may get caught staring at you\nbecause of how attractive they find you\nif when you spot them they quickly turn\naway and blush this could be a sign that\nthey're shy and embarrassed you saw them\nstealing a glance at you people also try\nto catch their crushes\nto let them know that they like them so\nif when you see them they linger a bit\nand give a smile this too could be a\nsign they want you to approach them and\nmake a move number two they smile and\nblush but only at you do you notice your\ncrush often smiles and blushes when you\napproach them and their friends you've\nnoticed they give a polite and friendly\nsmile to others but something seems a\nbit different when you approach their\nsmile either seems more flirty or\nperhaps it seems they give you a sweet\nsmile with a blush these are good\nindicators that they like you\ndiscussing attraction in a mind-body\ngreen article clinical psychologist Mary\nC lamia PhD points out that blushing is\nan honest response which can often be\nset off by someone feeling caught being\nsexually excited about another person\nnumber three their friends know a lot\nabout you when you meet their friends do\nyou notice they seem to smile as if\nthey've heard something about you it's\nlike they know a secret and are excited\nto finally meet you that secret being\nthat their friend likes you hopefully if\nyou find your crush's friends seem to\nknow a lot about you when you haven't\ntold them anything it's likely their\nfriend couldn't stop talking about you\nwith them\nAI because they like you too number four\nyou can't stop thinking about them when\nyou have a friend do you think about\nthem all day and night\nprobably not\nif there's someone that you're thinking\nabout all the time what they're doing if\nthey're thinking about you maybe even\nsome butterflies when you think about\nthem this might be a sign that it's time\nto ask them out on the Harley therapy\ncounseling blog Dr Sherry Jacobson\nexplains that this constant thought\ncycle on your crushes can be due to us\nbeing programmed by Society to idolize\nunhealthy romantic attraction she also\nexplains that some of us experience love\nlike an addict this is supported by\nCatherine Wu a Harvard third year\ngraduate student who explains that our\nbrains release dopamine and\nnorepinephrine when you're feeling\nattracted those feelings make you feel\ngiddy energetic and euphoric even\nleading to decreased appetite and\ninsomnia so if you've been thinking\nabout a special someone a lot this might\nbe your sign to ask them out\nnumber five flirtation\ndo they often make flirty jokes are they\nplayfully flirty around you\nif someone is flirting with you it's a\npretty clear sign that they're\ninterested in you the question is are\nthey interested in getting to know you\non a deeper level as well if they both\nshow a genuine interest in you and pair\nthat with a bit of flirting then they\nprobably want you to make the first big\nmove and ask them out\nnumber six they remember\noh what if they're not the flirty type\nif they've shown some of the previous\nsigns it could be that they like you but\nanother way to tell if they care is to\nsee how much they remember about you try\nhaving some deeper conversations or just\nletting them know if you interesting or\neven General facts about yourself\nperhaps you bring up your previous\nconversations in the future\ndo they remember them if they seem\npretty clueless as to what you're\nreferring to especially if it was an\nemotional or important topic then it\ncould be that they're uninterested or\nperhaps they have a pretty bad memory\nand number seven proximity and\ncomfortability\ndo you notice your crush often tries to\nbe alone with you when you want to be\nalone around your crush to get to know\nthem better or to perhaps take them out\nif they make it a point to be closer to\nyou than their other friends it could be\nthat they're trying to be alone with you\nso they can attempt to ask you out they\nmay even try to Simply Be in close\nproximity with you when you're in a\ngroup setting behavior analyst John R\nJack Shaffer PhD notes that people lean\ntowards people they like and distance\nthemselves from people they dislike\ninward leaning increases as report\nincreases but perhaps they can't help\nbut feel nervous and shy away from\nasking you out in the end if you're\ncomfortable around them like them and\nfind you can't stop thinking about them\nit seems it might be a good idea to\nSimply ask them out yourself\nso how do you even begin to ask someone\nout if you don't actually know them that\nwell try talking with them for a bit\nbefore you jump straight into the\ndecision\nyou may both be a bit nervous if you do\nhave crushes on each other so try to\nmake it a habit to talk to them and make\nthem feel comfortable once the\nconversation seems to be going smoothly\nperhaps try to throw in some hints that\nyou like them by giving them a\nmeaningful compliment what is it that\nyou like about them let them know in a\nrespectful and flirty way\nif you've already hung out together and\nare already friends you may want to give\nthem a few hints that you think of them\nas a potential romantic partner and then\nask them on a date this means making it\nclear it's a date commonly by saying\nit's one when you ask so beforehand\ncontinue giving them some compliments\ncatch their gaze smile at them\ndifferently than a friend might as long\nas you're not giving them a creepy stare\nand smile you should be good read their\nbody language too do they look\nuncomfortable are they not smiling back\nthen it might be that they don't want to\nbe approached by you don't ask them if\nthey've made it clear they're not\ninterested but if they are instead\nshowing the signs mentioned in this\nvideo and they haven't said that they're\nnot interested it could be that they're\nhoping for you to ask them out work up\nthe courage practice your confidence and\nfeel free to go for it sometimes it\nmight help to ask yourself would I\nregret it if I didn't try and ask them\nout if the answer is yes it can be a\ngood idea to put ourselves out there and\nseize a great opportunity when we can so\nif you've been admiring them and they've\nbeen giving some clear signs they feel\nthe same way about you then what are you\nwaiting for\nknowing if you should ask someone out\ncan be super nerve-wracking actually\nasking them out can be a whole different\nball game did you notice any of these\nsigns and someone that you think is\ncrushing on you let us know in the\ncomment section down
