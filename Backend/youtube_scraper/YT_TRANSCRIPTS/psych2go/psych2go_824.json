    "transcript": "trigger warning our video and Jeanette\nMcCurdy's book I'm glad my mom died\ndiscusses topics such as eating\ndisorders sexual assault sexual\nharassment abuse and mentions of\nunaliving oneself if these topics are\ntriggering to you please feel free to\nskip this video\nthis video is based on the thoughts\nfeelings words and experiences of\nJeanette McCarty that we're told in her\nbook I'm glad my mom died this video\ndoesn't reflect the thoughts and\nopinions of Psych duo or the writer if\nyou've been on social media recently you\nmay have heard of Jeanette McCurdy's\nbook I'm glad my mom died hearing that\ntitle most everyone had a different\nreaction some were shocked that she\nwould say something like that never mind\ntitle her book that some were intrigued\nto see what her mom could have done that\nwas so terrible\nspoiler alert Jeanette's mom was very\nabusive and controlling so much so that\nJeanette was only able to feel truly\nfree after her passing a bit morbid but\nif you're the child of a toxic parent\nyou may relate what made Jeanette and\nher mom's relationship so toxic and what\ncould you look out for in your own\nrelationships let's take a look at four\nways Jennette McCurdy and her mom's\nrelationship was unhealthy number one no\nautonomy when you're a child your\nparents are supposed to prepare you so\nyou're ready to leave the proverbial\nnest and have everything you need to be\nindependent unfortunately this wasn't\nthe case for Jeanette her mom seemed\nmuch more interested in pulling\njeannette's strings and distracting than\nteaching in her book McCurdy stated that\nher mother bathed her until she was 16\nyears old impossibly older her mother\ninvaded her privacy by conducting\nphysical exams similar to a physician or\ngynecologist too\nhumans develop in stages according to\nEric Erickson a psychology student of\nSigmund Freud the Adolescent phase of\ndevelopment occurs between the ages of\n12 and 18. this is the phase where we\nbegin finding ourselves our independence\nand making our own decisions in theory\nJeanette was in the age group of an\nindividual who should be able to care\nfor themselves on their own say when\nthey need medical attention and state\ntheir own thoughts and opinions but\nbecause Jeanette's mom never gave her\nthat Breathing Room Jeanette never\ndeveloped those skills being in the\nAdolescent stage or later stages and not\nbeing allowed to be independent can be a\nsign of an unhealthy apparent\nrelationship just like Jeanette and her\nmom's number two action equals love\nwhenever you're meeting new people one\nof the things we hear often is just be\nyourself they'll love you why because\npeople are meant to love you for you not\nfor the things you do Jeanette's mom\ndidn't subscribe to this way of thinking\nMcCarty begins her book with a story\nabout her her mom and her siblings\nwatching family movies not home movies\nif birthday parties or weddings no home\nmovies of when Jeanette's mom had cancer\nmom would narrate everyone's reactions\nand coping mechanisms and she would\ntreat them based on that for example in\nthe video one of Jeanette's Brothers\nkept leaving the room to collect himself\nmother praised him as if him being\ndistraught over his mother's diagnosis\nmade him a better person or child this\nwas very different from Jeanette she was\nscream singing Jingle Bells mother\nchastised Jeanette for this in present\nday saying how stupid she must be for\nnot being able to read the room and see\nno one is Happy Jeanette was two years\nold in the video but after hearing these\ncomments at eight Jeanette internalized\nthem for Life Jeanette's mother equated\naction with love if you do for me listen\nto me don't question me I'll love you\nthis thought process is consistent with\nindividuals diagnosed with narcissistic\nand or borderline personality disorders\nif a loved one isn't doing enough or the\nright thing the diagnosed individual May\nreact by using this harshness as a\ncoping mechanism to create distance and\nprotect themselves from being hurt\nJeanette's mom used this to push away\nfeelings that her daughter could have\nbeen happy that she was sick which\nabsolutely wasn't true however it also\nplanted the seed in jeannette's mind\nthat she's not intelligent and that she\nneeds mom's approval thinking that she\nneeds to do things for approval and love\nis another result of the unhealthy\nrelationship between Jeanette and her\nmother number three unhealthy coping\nmechanisms\nwhen something not so fantastic happens\ncoping mechanisms help us to either work\nthrough it or mask it\nany Naruto fans here remember when Asuma\ndied in battle and Shikamaru just buried\nit and kept busy so he didn't have to\nthink about it I know I know I know I\ndidn't want to bring it up either but\nthis is an example of an unhealthy\ncoping mechanism teaching positive\ncoping strategies is a part of the\ncaregiver role and part of that helping\nyou leave the nest thing we mentioned\nearlier from the stories Jeanette tells\nus it seems like Jeanette's mom was more\ninterested in teaching how to keep up\nlooks than healthy coping strategies in\nher book McCurdy was very open about her\nmother introducing her to food\nrestriction when she was able to follow\nthe diet mom laid down for her Jeanette\nfelt like she was in control of herself\nher looks and her life overall as she\ngot older became more famous and had\nmore opportunities Jeanette noticed that\nshe was in more situations that included\nfood it was stressful for Jeanette to\nnot follow mom's orders but it was also\nstressful when people noticed her not\neating McCurdy explains that this is\nwhen she began purging this became a\ncoping mechanism a way of holding on to\ncontrol a way of making everything okay\ninstead of working through feelings\nthoughts and situations as time went on\nJeanette developed her unhealthy coping\nmechanisms like drinking and like\nShikamaru burying her opinions these\nnegative coping mechanisms are one more\nway Jeanette in her mom's relationship\nwasn't a healthy one number four\nbrainwashing did you know brainwashing\nis actually real\nnow we're not talking about those little\npen thingies from Men In Black in this\nbook traumatic narcissism Daniel Shaw\ndefines traumatic narcissism as a form\nof trauma triggered by being denied a\nright to individuality and boundaries\nare broken if successful The Narcissist\ncan brainwash their target to become an\nextension of them and always seek their\napproval kind of like in South Park when\nCarmen fused with the Trapper Keeper\nJeanette's mom seemed to have a similar\nnarcissistic brainwashing hold on her\ndaughter there were multiple times in\nthe book where Jeanette recalled herself\nthinking I'm nothing without Mom even\nthough Jeanette was talented intelligent\nfunny and successful all on her own it\nwas never enough without mom's approval\nthis lack of self-worth even bled over\ninto Jeanette's relationships with her\nemployers when working with directors\nJeanette Woods stifle any concerns like\nsaying a lion that made her\nuncomfortable and do it anyway in hopes\nof gaining their approval to boost her\nself-worth in any healthy relationship\nyou should be building that person up\nand giving healthy constructive\ncriticism when needed and this is just\nanother way Jeanette's relationship with\nher mom wasn't a healthy one these are\njust some of the reasons why Jeanette\nand her mom didn't have a healthy\nparent-child relationship\nare there signs of a toxic relationship\nyou've seen that we didn't mention\ndrop a book emoji in the comments and\nlet us know if you want to know more\nabout the relationship pick up the book\nI'm glad my mom died by Jeanette McCurdy\nnot sponsored as always keep an eye on\nPsy for more
