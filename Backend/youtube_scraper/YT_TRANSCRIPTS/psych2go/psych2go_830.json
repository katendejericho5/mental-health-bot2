    "transcript": "sometimes we often think that we're\nangry because someone else made us angry\nor something has happened that just is\nthe reason why we're angry I believe\nthere's a difference between what I call\nthe cartoon world and the real world so\nour cartoon world it's the world\naccording to our shoulds so people\nshould think the way I want them to\nthink they should do what I want them to\ndo in other words when I'm on the road\nthere's a bunch of traffic and I say to\nmyself in my cartoon world this traffic\nshouldn't be here this shouldn't be\nhappening to me right now I'm gonna be\nreally angry but if I align my\nexpectations with reality which is\nanytime I go out on the highway there\ncould be traffic doesn't mean I'll be\nhappy when I see the traffic but it\nmeans I'll be more prepared for it we\nMaster what we practice and if we\npractice being impulsive and reactive\nwell we get really good at that but if\nwe practice being Mindful and in control\nwell we get really good at that too"
