    "transcript": "there's a famous quote from the 1995\nromantic film Before Sunrise that goes\neverything we do is just a way for us to\nbe left\nwould you agree\nwell a lot of people in the world\ncertainly seem to as nowadays everyone\nseems to be obsessed with finding love\nand being in the perfect relationship\nand while there's nothing wrong with\nstaying single especially if it's by\nchoice it's no doubt frustrating to\nconstantly be let down in the pursuit of\ntrue love and have nothing but a broken\nheart to show for it after a few failed\nor maybe the lack of relationships we\ncan't help but ask ourselves what are we\ndoing wrong will we ever find true love\nwell don't fret luckily psychology has a\nfew good answers for why true love seems\nto elude a lot of us and what we can do\nabout it so with that said here are six\nof the most common beliefs that keep\npeople single I'm incomplete without a\nrelationship have you ever noticed that\nironically it's always the people who\nwant to be in a relationship the most\nthat just can't seem to make it work\nsure they may date lots of people and\nnever stay single for long but their\nrelationships seem to fizzle out just as\nquickly as they came to be why while\nit's probably because they've mistakenly\ncome to believe that they need a\nrelationship in their life to be happy\nthis belief Echoes enmeshment which is a\nconcept in Psychology and Psychotherapy\nintroduced by Salvador minichen to\ndescribe families where personal\nboundaries are diffused and over\nconcerned for others leads to a loss of\nautonomous development but unbeknownst\nto them it's actually that kind of\ndesperation that's holding them back\nfrom finding true love because a lot of\nthe time they've probably just settle\nfor whoever comes along who's interested\nin them without truly reflecting on what\nthey want in a partner what they want\nout of a relationship and their worth as\na person even without one\nit didn't work out for my parents so it\nwon't work out for me there is an\ninteresting well-known study by Glenn\nand Kramer back in 1987 that found that\nChildren of Divorce were actually the\nmost likely to end up divorced\nthemselves and have the least amount of\ncommitment to their own marriages in\nspite of a great self-proclaimed desire\nfor otherwise\nand many psychologists and researchers\nsince then have speculated that it's\nbecause parental divorce can have a\npowerful and Lasting effect on our\nattitudes towards relationships even\nwhen we grow older so if it didn't work\nout between your parents you might think\nall of your relationships are doomed to\nfail too\nbeliefs about abandonment\nexperiencing parental abandonment in\nyour earlier life can also negatively\nimpact our chances at success in forming\nmeaningful and lasting relationships in\nattachment Theory we'd call having this\nkind of belief a characteristic of those\nwho are anxious avoidant people who have\nthis kind of insecure attachment style\ntend to have a negative view of others\nbut a positive view of themselves so\nthey become overly self-reliant\nemotionally distant and afraid of\nintimacy and commitment they feel\nuncomfortable with physical and\nemotional closeness have trouble sharing\ntheir true feelings and tend to pull\naway when they feel others getting too\nattached to them beliefs about being\ndamaged studies such as the one by\nHansen in 2010 show that people who've\nexperienced a traumatic event especially\na toxic or abusive relationship tend to\nwrestle with a lot of feelings of guilt\nself-blame and worthlessness they've\ninternalized that trauma to mean that\nthey're broken or that there must be\nsomething wrong with them making them\ntoo damaged to love but if this is true\nfor you it's important that you\nunderstand that you are not what\nhappened to you and that the harm other\npeople brought upon you was never your\nfault\none day when you've begun\n[Music]\nbecause trauma you will find someone who\nwill help you see that I'm still waiting\nfor the one lastly but certainly not\nleast another belief that might be\nkeeping you single is the idea that\nthere's someone out there who'll be able\nto perfectly meet all of your\nunrealistically high standards and\nexpectations don't get us wrong there is\nnothing bad about believing in soul\nmates it's just that so much of the\nlogic behind it is inherently flawed and\nif the psychology of successful\nrelationships has taught us anything\nit's that it's more about being the\nright person than finding the right\nperson to illustrate one of the most\nfamous relationship experts in the world\npsychologist John gottman has found that\nall happy long-term relationships\nexhibit Mutual understanding awareness\nacceptance respect and reciprocity of\nappreciation and relationship\nmaintenance notice how what we do seems\nto matter more than the qualities we\nbring to a relationship so can you\nrelate to any of the things we've\nmentioned on our list are you guilty of\nbelieving some of the things here that\nkeep you single against your choice\nalthough we might not realize it our\nthoughts have so much more power over us\nin our lives than we think so it's\nimportant that we're mindful of the\nbeliefs and attitudes that we have\ntowards our relationships in the words\nof Plato reality is created by the mind\nwe can change our reality by changing\nour mind no matter what it is that's\nbeen holding you back from finding a\nhappy and healthy relationship know that\nyou can always reclaim your power by\nadopting a more positive mindset look\nfor love all around you and become more\nloving towards yourself before jumping\nhead first into your next relationship\nso do you plan to overcome your limited\nbeliefs about love"
