    "transcript": "have you ever wondered about the life of\na con artist and how oh why they become\none you might have heard the name Anna\ndelvey recently from the Netflix series\ninvincing Anna but what you might not\nknow is her real name is Anna Sorkin\nwith that said let's explore the\npsychology of Anna delvey so who is Anna\ndelvey annadelvi is an alias of a woman\nwho pretended to be a German heiress she\nconned lots of money 275\n000 from New York's Rich Elite including\nBanks hotels and private jet companies\nby claiming she had a trust fund of 67\nmillion dollars she lied her way into\nnightclubs and parties by flaunting her\nwealth and her fake luxury Lifestyle on\nsocial media but in reality she was a\ngirl from a working class Russian family\ninterning at a fashion magazine who\nserved less than four years of her four\nto twelve year present sentence after\nbeing released for a good Behavior how\nbecause she had the belief and\nconfidence that she could pull it off in\na fake it till you make it imposter\nsyndrome sort of way people believed her\nconfidence was something called social\nproof when large groups of people\nbelieve something others will too so why\ndidn't Anna's so-called friends notice\nany red flags in her behavior even when\nshe asked them to pay for plane tickets\nand taxis and all expense trips because\nshe said she had trouble moving money\nfrom Europe because she was confident\nshe gaslit people and because of\nsomething called face work where most\npeople feel uncomfortable calling out\npeople who do bad things because we\ntrust that people are good or truthful\nso they just let it slide psychologist\nMaria kanakova looks at Anna's mindset\nand says it exploits our Fascination for\nan existence that's out of the ordinary\nshe says weak on people every day in our\nsocial behavior like when we pretend to\nlack or dislike the same things as our\nfriends to create common ground which is\nalmost a form of manipulation former FBI\nagents and psychologist Jack Schaefer\nhas interviewed scammers for years and\nsays women may be better con artists due\nto differences in the brain a thicker\ncorpus callosum the part that joins both\nhemispheres could give women the\nadvantage with more complex\ndecision-making persuasion and trust\nthat creates a connection with others or\nthe illusion of connection and\nfriendship this is done by psychological\ntechniques like mirroring which is\nmimicking other people's gestures and\nBody Language so what is the psychology\nbehind Anna delvey there are a few\ndifferent aspects behind Anna's behavior\nand how she was able to get away with\nconning so many people number one\nnarcissistic Anna has issues with vanity\nand entitlement and she's being called\nnarcissistic even though personality\npsychologist Brent Roberts says\nnarcissistic aspects like vanity and\nentitlement is on the decline in young\npeople number two delusions of grandeur\npsychologists worldwide have examined\nAnna's mental disorder and say she has\ndelusions of grandeur which is when you\nthink you have more wealth or power or\nother qualities than you do number three\nPsychopathic Anna is psychopathic\nbecause she doesn't care about rules or\nothers feelings or have remorse\naccording to the psychology in Seattle\npodcast on the psychology of Anna Del V\nshe's probably on the psychopathic\nspectrum because she doesn't care about\nsocietal rules or other people's\nfeelings and doesn't mind lying to\nothers or have much remorse she also\ndoesn't have a problem with manipulating\npeople which she's good at but even\nthough she did some Psychopathic things\non the scale of psychopathy she's kind\nof low the issue was that she had Big\nDreams and she was running out of money\nbecause she's on the psychopathic scale\nshe doesn't try to achieve her dreams of\nwealth and fame the normal way so she\nstarts to scheme and deceive people to\nget what she wants number four\nsociopathic one of Anna's friends Rachel\nWilliams that defrauded of 62 000 when\nshe paid the bull for a trip to Morocco\nfor Anna calls her a sociopath according\nto a psychology today article sociopaths\nshare some traits with Psychopaths a\ndisregard for laws and social values not\ncaring about others and not feeling\nguilt or remorse number five gaslighting\nAnna uses this technique when people\ncrash on her about not being able to\nmake payments for things because she\ndoesn't actually have any money but\nshe's supposed to be rich right so she\nacts like people are being stupid for\nquestioning her about it because that's\nridiculous of course the money will come\nbecause she's loaded she makes the other\npeople feel like they've got it all\nwrong and they're stupid for thinking\nthat number six social proof social\nproof occurs when you have people on\nboard with you it's easier to get others\nto follow this happens with large social\nmedia followings like Anna got with her\nfake lavish Instagram lifestyle once you\nstart networking with High Flyers you'll\nmake more connections with other rich\nand famous people giving you more\ncredibility and more people will believe\nwhat you say even if you're lying\nVanessa bonds a social psychologist says\nthat Anna and other con artists exploit\nthe processes we rely on daily as we\ncommunicate and cooperate as human\nbeings in society because we trust\nothers more than distrust them it might\nbe hard to believe that people who\nhardly knew Anna gave her their money\nand believed her when she said she'd get\nit later psychologists have done many\nexperiments over the years of people\ngiving money to complete strangers\nthinking they'll make a profit even when\npeople really wonder if they'll get\ntheir money back they still do it number\nseven First Impressions making a great\nfirst impression happens in seconds\nthrough through clothes body language\nand facial expressions it can lead\npeople to believe certain things about\nsomeone and then it's hard to change\ntheir minds Anna gave the impression\nthat she was wealthy with designer\nclothes and staying in expensive hotels\nthat she didn't end up paying for\nanother aspect of human behavior is that\nwe presume other people are sincere and\nbelieve people are truthful so when a\nfirst impression is someone is Rich they\nstick to that belief some researchers\nhave found evidence for the truth\ndefault in experiments when interrupting\npeople when they're trying to figure out\nif statements are true or false people\ndefaulted to saying they were true\nbecause if we don't trust others or\nbelieve they're telling the truth and\nbelieve who they say they are we can't\nbuild relationships with other people\nand we have to trust others otherwise\nSociety doesn't work how would Airbnb or\nride sharing work if we didn't trust\nstrangers number eight real body framing\nanother technique is reality framing\nwhere you build a certain reality and\nlive it 100 so that other people buy\ninto it and believe it too even if it's\ntotally fake and that's what Anna did\nand anyone who questions her reality is\ngaslighted and mates believe they're\nbeing ridiculous what do you think of\nAnna Sorkin pretending to be Young Rich\nand adulvi who influenced others to pay\nfor things for her because they believed\nshe was wealthy when she really wasn't\nlooking into the psychology behind why\ncertain people like con artists do what\nthey do is really interesting don't you\nagree let us know your thoughts in the\ncomments below until next time thanks\nfor watching"
