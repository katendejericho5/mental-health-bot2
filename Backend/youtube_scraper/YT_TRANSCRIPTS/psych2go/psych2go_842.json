    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Whether\nyou're a full-on Swifty\nor an occasional listener,\nyou have to admit,\nTaylor Swift's new album,\n\"Midnights,\" relates to almost everyone\nin some way or another.\nThe single \"Anti-Hero has a\nline that really inspired us.\nIn the song, Taylor sings,\n\"Did you hear my covert narcissism\nI disguise as altruism like some kind\nof congressman, tale as old as time.\"\nNow, psychologist Dr. Ramani\ndid a breakdown of Taylor's\n\"Anti-Hero\" music video\nand mentioned that Taylor may not be using\nthe term covert narcissism correctly,\nbut this lyric got us thinking.\nDo narcissists disguise\ntheir narcissism as kindness?\nHow do they do this and\nwhat can we look out for?\nIn 1987, then 1992, David\nBuss led two studies\nto determine the different\nmanipulation tactics.\nHis research revealed that there\nare six most common tactics\nused to manipulate others.\nSo without further ado,\nhere are six signs someone\nis faking kindness\nand masking narcissism\nbased on Buss' studies.\nLet's go.\nGive 'em the old razzle dazzle.\nOne of our writers used to work\nat a bank and gave us\nsome really cool insight.\nWhile you're working, you\nhave to keep an eye out\nfor everyone who might rob the bank.\nThey're told to look out\nfor overly shy, overly rude\nand overly nice people.\nWhat?\nYeah, in Buss' studies, charm was one\nof the most common manipulation\ntactics used on others.\nEssentially, the manipulator fakes good\nor is overly nice to distract you\nfrom what's really going on.\nBack to the bank robber example.\nIt may not be the classic black ski mask\nand sacks of cash scenario we're used to,\nbut what if a customer is overly nice\nto a teller to distract them\nfrom noticing he gave her a fake ID?\nThis can also be a sign of a\nnarcissist faking kindness.\nIt's a ploy to distract you\nfrom their selfish priorities.\nMom.\nA lot of parents tell us,\nif you don't have anything nice to say,\ndon't say anything at all.\nWell, when does that go too far?\nSometimes people will\nremain completely silent\nand won't even respond\neven if directly addressed.\nThis is famously known\nas the silent treatment,\nwhich is a second manipulation\ntactic Buss found.\nThe 1998 study on the silent\ntreatment defines the tactic\nas composed of mostly avoidance\nand eye contact, an absence\nof verbal communication.\nDuring the study, participants\nwere asked to list behaviors\nthat happened while giving\nor receiving the silent treatment.\nThe researchers found\nthat when receiving the silent treatment,\ntheir participants felt\nthat their need to belong,\ntheir self-esteem, their control\nand their status were all\nat risk with the person\ngiving the silent treatment.\nNow, add the narcissist.\nThey understand this and\nuse this silent treatment\nas a tactic to make others\nlook to them for hits\nof dopamine, like being\nincluded or getting approval.\nThis in turn, helps boost\nthe narcissist's self-inflating ego.\nWith a cherry on top.\nDo you remember when you were a kid\nand you really wanted\nto convince your parents\nto do something?\nWhat did you do?\nYou pulled out all the\nstops to convince them.\nSo your friend is having a party\nand you want permission\nto sleep over afterwards.\nYou might remind them\nhow you haven't asked\nfor anything in months,\nbeen doing all the chores,\nare passing all of your classes,\nand even how you've been responsible\nwhile driving the family car.\nYou might even promise to help out\nwith some extra stuff around\nthe house just to be safe.\nThis is similar to\nsomething narcissists use\nto manipulate others called coercion,\nwhich is Buss' third tactic.\nCoercion is defined by the APA dictionary\nas the process of attempting\nto influence another person\nthrough the use of\nthreats, punishment, force,\ndirect pressure, and other\nnegative forms of power.\nSo instead of giving\nreasons why someone should\nor shouldn't do something,\nthey're basically making\nthe person feel bad\nabout themselves or blackmailing them\nin some way just to get what you want.\nThis might look like a\nnarcissistic parent saying\nyou won't help your mother\nbring in the groceries.\nFine, I'll take care of it\nmyself, and when I'm done,\nyou'll remember that you didn't help.\nDark, I know, but this is a\ncommon tactic narcissists use\nto sneak around boundaries\nand still get that yes from you.\nIt just makes sense.\nThere are a lot of logic-based\npersonalities out there.\nCheck out our video\non the MBTI personality types broken down\nto learn more about them.\nSometimes narcissists can lean on logic\nto reason with someone\nand manipulate them.\nThis is Buss' fourth tactic.\nLet's go back to our\nbuddy, the bank robber.\nInstead of slipping the teller a fake ID,\nhe decides on doing a full on\nheist, but he needs a partner.\nHe asks a friend, Leon,\nwho immediately and rightfully,\nI might add, said no.\nTo reason with Leon,\nthe robber says that Leon will\nbe able to pay off his debt,\nhis bills, and move into a\nbigger home for his family.\nNow, is this true?\nNot necessarily, and especially\nnot if they get caught\nbut it is reasonable to say\nthat if you have a lot of money,\nyou can pay off debt and bills.\nHigh risk, high reward.\nThat reasoning is how the\nrobber is manipulating Leon.\nA narcissist can do the\nsame to get what they'd like\nfrom you, especially if you're\na sensible, logical person.\nBack in time.\nIf you watched \"How I Met Your Mother,\"\nyou know Barney Stinson\nloved a good challenge\nto pick up a lady.\nOne challenge he took\non was picking up a girl\nat a bar while talking and\nacting like a literal infant.\nDepending on who you are,\nthis might be your deal.\nNo king shaming here.\nBut if your partner is acting like a baby\nas a way to get what they\nwant, that's a different story.\nPsychologist Sigmund Freud\ndiscovered this phenomenon\nof regression and found this\nis an unconscious reversion\nto an earlier time in life.\nIt can be either temporary or long term.\nThis is a defense mechanism to help cope\nwith more difficult emotions\nand situations rather\nthan working through\nthem in a healthy manner.\nThis could look like a narcissist whining\nand raising their voice to manipulate you\ninto dropping the argument.\nThis is the second to last\ntactic discovered by Buss.\nYou won't believe the last one.\nNow, it's personal.\nThe final tactic Buss\nuncovered is debasement,\nwhich is a fancy way of\nsaying bringing you down.\nIf a narcissist using debasement\nto manipulate wrote \"Anti-Hero,\"\nthe chorus might be it's you.\nHi. You are the problem.\nIt's you.\nWhether it's making fun\nof their appearance, their\nopinions, their hobbies,\nthe narcissist will use\nanything and everything they can\nagainst you to make you feel\nsmall and bring you down.\nThe narcissist logic is that\nif you feel not good enough\nor lesser than,\nyou'll see them as superior\nand follow or listen to them.\nThink Regina George from \"Mean Girls.\"\nShe kept everyone close\nenough so they knew\nthat they were in the inner circle,\nbut she'd insult them every so often\nso they continued doing things\nfor her and seeking her approval.\nTaylor says she can't look\ndirectly in the mirror\nbut she just called out her biggest flaws\nand insecurities for millions to hear.\nThanks, Taylor for showing us\nhow important self-reflection is.\nNow, all of this isn't\nto say that true kindness\ndoesn't exist out there.\nWe're simply bringing light to the fact\nthat narcissists can take your kindness\nfor granted or use it for their benefit.\nThis is why it's so important to learn\nhow to differentiate\ntrue and forced kindness.\nAre there any other telltale signs\nof a narcissist faking kindness\nthat we didn't mention?\nTell us below.\nIf you made it to the end of this video,\ndrop a hero emoji in the comments.\nAs always, keep your eye\non site for more Psych2Go content.\nUntil next time."
