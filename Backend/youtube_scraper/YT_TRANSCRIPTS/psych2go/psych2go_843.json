    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Psi has\nbeen feeling so exhausted\nthat he doesn't even have the energy\nto hang out with his friends.\nHe still wants to spend time\nwith the people he loves\nand do things he enjoys,\nbut he's frustrated\nbecause his fatigue is\npreventing him from doing so.\nHe's had trouble sleeping\nand has been feeling like\nthis for the past week.\nHe often asks himself, 'Am\nI depressed or just tired?'\nAfter all, according to a 2018 study\nby Ghanean and colleagues,\nfatigue occurs in over 90%\nof people with depression.\nSo it can be hard to tell the difference\nbased on his symptoms.\nDo you think Psi is tired or depressed?\nKeep watching till the end of the video\nto find out the answer\nand to learn four signs\nthat you might be depressed,\nnot just fatigued.\nNumber one, your interest.\nOne of the main differences\nbetween depression and tiredness\nis your level of interest.\nIn an interview with\nHealthline, Alex Dimitru,\na sleep expert and\npsychiatrist, explained that\nhe asks his patients a\nkey question to determine\nwhether they are depressed\nor just sleep deprived.\nDo you feel too tired to\ndo enjoyable activities\nbut still wish you could\nparticipate in them?\nOr do you have no interest in\ndoing these activities at all?\nIf you feel tired, but are\nstill interested in doing things\nthat bring you pleasure, you're\nless likely to be depressed.\nBut if you feel uninterested\nin doing anything,\nthen this could be a\nwarning sign of depression.\nNumber two, your mood.\nFeeling physically tired is one thing\nbut severe negative change in\nyour mood is another story.\nAccording to Verywell\nMind, if you're depressed,\nyou might feel hopeless or\nhave a low sense of self-worth.\nYou may also notice that\nyou can't concentrate well\nand have a harder time making decisions.\nDid you know that mood\nswings are also common\nin people with depression?\nA 2017 study published in\nFrontiers in psychiatry\nshowed that mood instability\nwas highly correlated\nwith depressive symptoms.\nIf you've been having noticeable\nfluctuations in your mood,\nthis may be a sign\nthat depression is the\nroot cause of your fatigue.\nNumber three, speech and eye movement.\nWhen we think of depression,\nwe often think of its emotional effects\nrather than the physical.\nBut according to a 2010 study,\ndepression affects psychomotor skills,\na combination of bodily movement\nand cognitive processes.\nThis includes speech and eye movement.\nDo you feel that you've\nbecome less articulate\nor pause more during conversations?\nMaybe you don't make eye\ncontact as much as you used to\nor speak more quietly with\nless enthusiasm and emotion.\nAll of these changes are indicators\nof reduced psychomotor\nfunction related to depression.\nAnd number four, persistent symptoms.\nTime for a check-in.\nIf you relate to the points\nin this video so far,\nhow long have you been\nexperiencing these symptoms?\nWe all feel down sometimes.\nAn occasional sadness is not necessarily\nan indicator of depression.\nIf you only have these\nsymptoms every once in a while\nrather than persistently,\nyou may not meet the diagnostic criteria\nfor clinical depression.\nAccording to the World\nHealth Organization,\nfor your symptoms to be characterized\nas a depressive episode\nthey must occur for at least\ntwo weeks, almost every day\nand for most of the day.\nHave you been experiencing\nall of the symptoms\nwe've listed persistently\nfor over two weeks?\nIf yes, you may be\nsuffering from depression,\nespecially if your symptoms include\nfeelings of worthlessness, hopelessness,\nand a loss of interest in\npleasurable activities.\nIf you relate to the signs\nmentioned in the video,\nwe wanna remind you to be kind to yourself\nand you can always talk to a\nmental health professional.\nSo after watching this video,\ndid you come up with the\nanswer to Psi's question?\nYou guessed it.\nHe was tired but not depressed.\nHe was still interested in\ndoing enjoyable activities.\nHe wasn't experiencing\nany major mood changes\nand his fatigue had only\nbeen going on for a week.\nSo, it's more likely\nthat he's experiencing\ntemporary tiredness\nrather than depression.\nHave you been experiencing\nfatigue, depression, or both?\nShare in the comments below\nto relate to others in our community.\nTo learn more about this topic,\ncheck out 10 things only\ndepressed people will understand.\nIf you found this video\nhelpful, leave a like\nand share it with those\nwho might benefit from it.\nSubscribe for more educational,\nmental health content.\nUntil next time, and thanks\nso much for watching.\n(light music)"
