    "video_title": "Are You a Highly Sensitive Person?",
    "transcript": "the term highly sensitive has a deeper\ndefinition than what it's become known\nas in today's society it was coined in\nthe mid-1990s by psychologists Elaine\nand Arthur Aaron to describe individuals\nwho process events or situations more\nthan others unfortunately the term came\nwith a negative stigma for many years\nSociety perceived highly sensitive\npeople as overthinkers or people who\ntook things too personally they were\nperceived as sensitive touchy and high\nmaintenance many were diagnosed as\nautistic one they may not have actually\nbeen on the autism spectrum although\nindividuals with autism and high\nsensitivity experience sensitivity to\ntheir environments they aren't\ninterchangeable here are a few traits\nmany HSP people exhibit or experience\nnotice changes easily\nnot everyone's central nervous systems\nare the same highly sensitive people\ntend to have a greater capacity for\nfeeling and processing more information\nin their environment consequently hsps\nreact with more stress and quickly\nnotice subtle changes in their\nenvironment\naccording to Andre solo from Psychology\ntoday\nboth though being autistic and having\nhigh sensitivity are two different\nthings autistic children and hsps may\nreact in a similar way when they get\noverwhelmed by a noisy or busy\nenvironment those with autism shutting\ndown or having tantrums and the HSP\nchild may act the same way if they\nhaven't been taught strategies by their\nparents like having time alone and\nlearning to say no to avoid becoming too\noverwhelmed\nSound Sensitivity\ndid you ever wonder how on Earth\nSuperman kept his sanity the guy had\nsuper hearing and if you are an HSP you\nmight share his pain\nas a result a highly sensitive person is\nmore reactive to sounds in their\nenvironment so loud noises can be\nuncomfortable or unbearable according to\nresearcher Bianca Acevedo and her\ncolleagues being an HSB is a trait not a\ndisorder that 20 of people and many\nother species have Studies have shown\nthat highly sensitive people are also\naffected by other people's moods this\nsensitivity is also common for autistic\npeople but they have a different brain\nstructure compared to highly sensitive\npeople the overlaps in those with autism\nor HSP occur with sounds and noises but\neven though both conditions involve a\nsensitivity towards sound the reasons\nare different\nan autistic person's brain structure may\nbe the cause of the noise sensitivity\nresearchers White House and Bishop say\nit may be due to processes in the brain\ninterfering with encoding and early\nprocessing of sound either way being\nsuper sensitive to sound means that\nnormally noisy environments like being\nin a small or busy downtown Center may\nmake you feel uncomfortable or\noverwhelmed there was a theory that\nprocessing sounds was at the heart of\nspeech and language learning problems\nand Sound Sensitivity in some autistic\npeople but in the early 2000s Nicole\nRusso and her team at the auditory\nNeuroscience laboratory disproved this\nTheory and established measurable\ndifferences in auditory Pathways which\ncan explain why speech or complex sound\ncauses sensitivity\nfor hsps their brains activate in areas\nassociated with empathy social\nprocessing and reflection\nyour environment according to Rachel\nSampson psychologist HSP is a marker of\nan expansive central nervous system so\nit's not simply down to genes your\nenvironment also plays a role and can\nhelp determine how it's handled as an\nadult\nSamson writes that studies suggest that\nan unsupportive and stressful childhood\nenvironment May contribute to the\ndevelopment of high sensitivity\nthey may feel intense emotions or pain\nmore than other children and may not\nlearn how to constructively deal with\ntheir issues and end up in a negative\ncycle of being ostracized or more hurt\non the plus side if they can learn how\nto handle their sensitivities like when\nto graciously decline an invitation or\nhow to exit a situation when it becomes\ntoo much that can be supportive our\ngenes and environment contribute to our\nmental and health development but they\ndon't Define us you can find ways to\nthrive with the right coping mechanisms\nfor you if you are a highly sensitive\nperson"
