    "transcript": "hey sex2goers and welcome back to\nanother video you might have heard that\non average there's an ever increasing\namount of teenagers and young adults who\nare sad or depressed perhaps you are a\nyoung person or have young people in\nyour life that you love and care for and\nare wondering why this is the case in\ntoday's video we'll be looking at some\nof the reasons why so many young people\nare unhappy\nnumber one comparison with others do you\nfind yourself endlessly scrolling\nthrough social media absorbing content\nfrom these various platforms comparison\nwith others has become even easier with\nhow accessible social media is which can\nbe dangerous for young people\naccording to Professor Derek wurtz of\nUBC Okanagan viewing images and updates\nthat selectively portray others\npositively may lead social media users\nto underestimate how much others\nactually experience negative emotions\nand lead people to conclude that their\nown life with its mix of positive and\nnegative feelings is by comparison not\nas good\nthis decrease of self-esteem can lead\nyou wondering why you're not enough it's\nimportant to remember that not\neverything we see on social media is a\nhundred percent authentic and everyone's\nlife is unique constantly comparing can\nleave anyone feeling dissatisfied and\nunhappy because we are reaching for an\nunachievable standard\nnumber two lack of gratitude not\nfocusing on your blessings and all the\ngood things in life can contribute to an\noverall sense of unhappiness everyone\nyoung old poor or rich is capable of\npracticing gratitude Oprah Winfrey best\nknown for her talk show the Oprah\nWinfrey Show stated be thankful for what\nyou have you'll end up having more if\nyou concentrate on what you don't have\nyou will never ever have enough if you\nsolely focus on achieving the next big\nthing or acquiring something you don't\nhave you will constantly feel as if\nyou're falling short and be unhappy as a\nresult\nit is inhumanator to always be reaching\ntoward an unknown a greater which we\ndon't have by gratitude if noted can\nground us rather than focusing on what\nyou don't have in life how about taking\na moment to think about all the things\nyou do have number three fear of failure\ndo you find that fear failure stops you\nfrom living your best life some people\nare so frightened of making mistakes\nthat they never step outside their\ncomfort zone\nas children so many people would claim\nthe highest trees they could find but as\nadulthood Creeps in we can lose that\nbravery and don't set such high\nAmbitions in reality life is filled with\nfailures big and small\nthey are day-to-day and long-term\ndefeats that we must persevere through\nif we are faced with fear every time\nthis happens our lives would become\nridden with anxiety decreasing our\nhappiness\naccording to licensed psychologist guy\nwinch people unconsciously sabotage\nthemselves when their motivation to\navoid failure exceeds their motivation\nto succeed this mentality is always\ngoing to limit your full potential so\ninstead why not consider the approach\nthat trying and not succeeding might be\nbetter than not trying at all maybe\nyou'll even get it the next time\nnumber four living in the past or future\noften when people ruminate too much on\nthe past this can create feelings of\nregret grief and overthinking what ifs\nin contrast living too far in the future\ncan cause anxiety and fear of the big\nunknown do you relate to any of these\nfeelings while it is useful to consider\nour past and learn from our mistakes and\nthinking into the future can provide\nsecurity and structure focusing too much\non these instead of being present can\nlead to unhappiness as difficult as it\nmay be to accept we cannot change the\npast or control the future so it's\nunfeasible to always be focusing on it\nthinking about the present and living in\nthe moment can ease your mind and allow\nyou to enjoy your current life you will\nbegin to Value the simpler things and\ncherish these moments which is how life\nshould be number five no time for\nthemselves life can feel the very\nchaotic and taking time to focus on\nself-care and things you enjoy is\nimportant\nwhilst this may look different to\neveryone we all benefit from spending\ntime on activities that bring us joy\nwhether it's watching your favorite TV\nreruns or spending time Outdoors for\ninstance a group of medical students\npartic in an online questionnaire\ndesigned to measure self-care perceived\nstress and quality of life the results\nsuggest that self-reported engagement in\nself-care activities is associated with\na decrease in the strength of the\nrelationship between perceived stress\nand quality of life in medical students\nthrough self-care they were able to\ncompensate with the stress they were\nexperiencing keeping work and personal\ntime separate allowed them to live\nhappier life if you don't do this for\nyourself it can start to take a toll on\nyour mental health so it's really\nimportant to prioritize spending time on\nand for yourself to maintain a healthy\nbalance number six they hate their job\nresearch suggests that on average people\nspend one third of their time at work it\ngoes without saying that this is a lot\nof time so if you hate your workplace or\njob position this can really impact your\noutlook on life and overall happiness if\nyour happiness is being affected it is\nalso likely that you are going to\nexperience a decline in your mental\nhealth\naccording to Centers for Disease Control\nand prevention depression interferes\nwith the person's ability to complete\nphysical job tasks about 20 of the time\nand reduces cognitive performance about\n35 of the time this can cause an\ninsecurity in your financial life which\ncan contribute even more to your overall\nunhappiness whilst it can be difficult\nto get out of a job it can help to think\nabout a job you would be passionate\nabout working towards if you don't like\nyour job what would you want to change\nnumber seven they care too much about\nothers opinions navigating young\nadulthood can be particularly\nchallenging because it's easy to fall\ninto the Trap of overthinking other\npeople's opinions life feels easier once\nwe accept that not everyone we come\nacross is going to like us and that's\nokay in fact focusing on trying to\nsatisfy everyone is draining and takes\naway from what we want to achieve a\nfamous quote by Virginia Woolf and\nEnglish writer says the eyes of others\nare prison their thoughts are cages this\npresents the idea that any perception of\nourselves from peers are often a trap\nleading us to feel stuck in what we\nthink are truths falling into this can\nbe dangerous as you lose sight of who\nyou really are you begin to question\nthings that you have never thought twice\nof before and this can affect your\nself-esteem and mental health try\nfocusing on what you want from your life\nrather than what other people might want\nnumber eight lay don't learn from their\nmistakes learning from my mistakes can\nbe crucial as it helps us grow and\nchange this allows you to cultivate a\ngrowth mindset based on Research\nconducted by American psychologist Carol\ndweck when people have a growth mindset\nthey take on challenges and learn from\nthem therefore increasing their\nabilities and achievements mistakes can\nnurture our understanding of the world\nand its Concepts growing us into more\ninformed and experienced individuals\nhowever some people tend to find\nthemselves in the same terrible\nsituation and repeat self-destructing\npatterns they might Harbor a fixed\nmindset where they feel stagnant and\nunable to improve and laugh a challenge\nor mistake might frustrate and\ndiscourage them and instead of trying to\ngrow from it they give up the sooner you\ncan notice these repeated patterns the\nquicker you can break out of them and\nreduce the negative situation you find\nyourself in number nine they think they\ndon't deserve happiness some people fall\ninto the mindset that they don't deserve\nhappiness this may be due to a range of\nreasons but most being an array of\nmental health issues the National\nInstitute of Mental Health states that\nfeelings of guilt worthlessness or\nhelplessness can be Hallmarks of\ndepression if you are feeling a\nprolonged sense of unworthiness of\nHappiness there's a chance that it is an\nindicator of a deeper mental health\nissue to contrast many may feel bouts of\nthis emotion where it isn't lasting but\ninstead intense and short this feeling\nis an obvious barrier between you and\nyour contentment everyone deserves the\nopportunity to experience Happiness by\nmodifying the approach you have to\nyourself and your worth you might help\nyourself discover the happy place you\ndeserve so there we have it the
