    "transcript": "do you believe in the idea that we are\nultimately in charge of our own\nhappiness and that happiness is always a\nchoice\nthroughout history there have been\nplenty of great examples of individuals\nwho have found happiness in spite of\neven the most dire of circumstances\npeople like Anne Frank and Malala\nyousafzai they become symbols of the\nBountiful resilience hope optimism and\nfighting spirit that we all have inside\nof us\nperhaps one of the most moving of all is\nthe life of Eva Moses core a\nromanian-born American Holocaust\nSurvivor Eva and her twin sister Miriam\nmore subjected to cruel human\nexperimentation at the Auschwitz\nconcentration camp during World War II\nand yet in spite of all of those years\nshe suffered at the hands of the Nazis\nEva dedicated most of her later life\ntrying to locate other survivors of the\nexperiment and founded a humanitarian\norganization that vowed not only to tell\nthe story of these victims but to preach\nvalues of love peace and forgiveness\nAbove All Else\nbut if these stories are anything to go\nby\nthen why aren't more people happy and\nwhy does it seem so hard for the rest of\nus well psychology tells us that it's\nnot actually that simple and that\nthere's a lot more to happiness than we\nthink\nin fact some people can even fear\nhappiness and become addicted to sadness\ninstead\nbut with that said here are six\npsychology-backed reasons why you might\nbe addicted to sadness\nnumber one learned helplessness\na concept first studied by psychologist\nMartin Seligman learned helplessness is\ndefined as a sense of powerlessness\noften arising from a traumatic event or\npersistent failure to succeed but tends\nto develop into depressive and\nself-destructive behavioral patterns and\ntendencies simply put learned\nhelplessness is what happens when you've\nbeen chronically abused and traumatized\nto the point where you no longer believe\nit possible that things will ever get\nbetter\ntragedy and suffering have played such a\nlarge role in your life for so long you\nstart to think there's nothing you can\ndo to change things for the better\nanymore and you become resigned hopeless\nand addicted to sadness\nnumber two positive reinforcement\nanother reason why we may become\naddicted to sadness is if it is\npositively reinforced in US positive\nreinforcement happens when a desirable\nstimulus reinforces a certain behavior\nin us making it more likely to reoccur\nsimply put when we are rewarded and\nenabled for our sadness it's all too\neasy to become addicted to it and get\nstuck in our ways\nan example would be if constantly\nplaying the victim and needing to be\nsaved from your own sadness is the only\nway you've learned how to get close to\nothers and gain the care and attention\nof your loved ones\nnumber three Choice Theory\npioneered by a world-renowned\npsychotherapist William Glasser\nChoice theory in a nutshell posits that\nwe are all responsible for what we\nchoose to do and that we're much more in\ncontrol of our lives than we realize in\nfact Glasser once famously said that we\nchoose everything we do including the\nmisery we feel so according to Choice\nTheory you might be addicted to sadness\nbecause you are be it knowingly or\nunknowingly choosing to punish yourself\nwith these feelings\nso think long and hard is there anything\nyou feel guilty about in your life that\nmight cultivate such feelings of\nself-loathing\nnumber four\nunhealed trauma\nsimilar to the last Point trauma can\noften lead to an unconscious desire for\nunhappiness in our lives especially if\nleft unresolved\nwhy because more often than not those\nwho have suffered a traumatic experience\nhave a hard time moving on from their\npast and instead fall into the Trap Of\nDenial negativity and self-sabotage they\nbecome resistant to positive change\nbecause happiness Safety and Security\njust seem so scary and unfamiliar to\nthem now\nin their minds happiness is fleeting in\ntransient so why bother trying to chase\nafter it when you'll only end up\ndisappointed\nnumber five low self-esteem some people\nalso become addicted to sadness as a\nresult of having low self-esteem\ndeeply rooted insecurities and a lack of\nself-worth can lead them to believe that\nthey don't deserve to be happy they're\nextremely harsh and critical towards\nthemselves and often find it difficult\nto overcome their own sense of self-pity\nthey're quick to blame themselves for\neverything that goes wrong in their\nlives even if they have no control over\nit and are often plagued by feelings of\nworthlessness and inadequacy\nand number six undiagnosed mental health\nissues finally what perhaps most\nimportantly a hyper fixation on one's\nown sadness can be a key indicator that\nsomeone is suffering from an undiagnosed\nmental health issue whether it's anxiety\ndepression PTSD borderline personality\ndisorder or something else entirely\npeople struggling with an undiagnosed\nmental illness will have a harder time\nthan most regulating their emotions and\novercoming feelings of sadness and\ndistress\nand the longer they go without getting\nthe help they need the harder it'll be\nfor them to overcome their mental\nillness that's why it's so important\nthat if you or anyone you know is\nstruggling with their mental health to\nnot hesitate to reach out to a mental\nhealth care professional right away and\nif you relate to any of the things we've\nmentioned here and feel it applies to\nyour situation right now\nseek help and open up about it to\nsomeone you trust the sooner you can\nbreak the habit of being addicted to\nyour own Sadness the better your life\nwill be\nso what's your reason for being addicted\nto sadness and how do you plan to\novercome it"
