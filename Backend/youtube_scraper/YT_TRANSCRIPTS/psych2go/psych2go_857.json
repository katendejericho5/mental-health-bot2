    "transcript": "for many intelligence is a high standing\naspect of the one who possesses it in\nsome cases they're expected to achieve\ngreatness while it may seem that\nintelligent people have it better due to\ntheir intelligence awareness and the\npressure of the outside world there are\na few areas where they might struggle\neven with their High Intelligence they\nare still people who struggle sometimes\njust like everyone else keep watching to\nfind out the difficulties intelligent\npeople struggle with on a daily basis\nnumber one mental and emotional\ndisorders a 2011 study published in the\nFrontiers in evolutionary Neuroscience\nfound a correlation between general\nanxiety and high IQs the cause they\nposited that individuals with higher IQs\nhad lower concentrations of choline in\ntheir white matter choline is a compound\nthat helps produce a neurotransmitter\nacetylcholine which helps regulate your\nmood additionally a study conducted by\nRuth karpinski of fitzer college and her\ncolleagues showed that intelligent\nindividuals are at higher risk for\npsychological and physiological\noverexcitabilities her findings showed\nthat out of the group of people they\nstudied 47 percent suffered from mental\nillnesses the study looked into a high\nIQ society called Mensa that only\naccepts people with IQs of 132 or higher\nthis information was included in an\nOrigins article Origins is a care\nprovider that focuses on addiction\nmental illness and others they dove into\nwhat the Mensa study might say about the\npossible causes and reasons why people\nwith high IQs have a high probability of\ndeveloping mental illnesses\nsome possible reasons described are over\nexcitability intelligence genes causing\nmental illness social isolation and that\nintelligent people are more likely to\nget mental help\naccording to Origins overexcitability\ncan turn into over analyzation worry and\nrumination that will eventually turn\ninto anxiety or depression normally\npeople with higher IQs are ostracized or\npushed to the fringes of society due to\nthe society not being able to understand\nthem this isolation in turn can cause\ndepression finally due to their High IQs\nintelligent people are more self-aware\nand can know when there's something\nwrong with them quicker than normal\npeople\nbecause of this self-awareness they're\nmore likely to seek medical and mental\nhealth to get diagnosed more so than\nothers\nnumber two stress\nwhile intelligent people have the\nability to synthesize information and\nunderstand complex information they're\njust as sensitive to stress as many of\nus perhaps even more so than the average\nperson as mentioned in the previous\nPoint highly intelligent individuals\nhave a reduced concentration of choline\nin their white matter due to the reduced\nproduction of acetylcholine many higher\nintelligent people are sensitive to\nstress acetylcholine is an important\nneurotransmitter that regulates your\nstress without enough choline people can\ndevelop anxiety chronic stress or\ndepression\nneither of the three are conducive to\ngood brain function or a happy life if\nyou also take into account the social\npressure and scrutiny intelligent\nindividuals are placed under life for a\nhighly intelligent person may not be as\nfantastic as you might think luckily\ncholine is found in foods you may\nalready consume fish poultry eggs and\nnuts number three social burden\nwhen you picture a highly intelligent\nperson you probably picture a Nobel\nPrize winner or a successful CEO\nunconsciously we hold these individuals\nto certain standards but intelligence\ndoes not automatically indicate success\naware of the expectation of others in\nsociety highly intelligent individuals\nmight feel pressured or place undue\npressure on themselves they might take\non more than they can handle which\neventually leads to burnout they may\nalso try to do big things quickly\nmeaning they pay no attention to the\nsmall steps they need to take in order\nto make those big things happen which\ncan lead to them failing Marty nemco PhD\na personal coach and educational\npsychologist wrote in a psychology today\nblog about how intelligent people are\nperceived in terms of expectations\nthey're expected to always be\nintelligent said nemco but even smart\npeople aren't always on and then like\nanyone else they're more mistake prone\nthey and others are particularly hard on\nthemselves because of the disparity\nbetween their usual functioning and\ntheir error nemco continued intelligent\npeople are expected to make a big\ndifference in the world lest they choose\na less ambitious career they're often\ndenigrated as not living up to their\npotential\nnumber four negative impressions\ndue to their intelligence and the way\nthey express themselves intelligent\npeople may come off as full of\nthemselves arrogant or know-it-alls most\npeople don't like it when they feel as\nif others are trying to flaunt their\nintelligence because it makes them feel\ninadequate although not all intelligent\npeople flaunt their High IQs instead\nthey like to talk about what they know\nand try to help others having a high IQ\ndoesn't mean that you're smart at\neverything\nmany highly intelligent people don't\nknow how to behave socially nor do they\nhave emotional intelligence this gets\nthem into trouble sometimes as they may\nsay or do things unintentionally that\nconfuse or hurt other people and number\nfive self-esteem tied to their\nintelligence\nanother negative side to being\nintelligent is that due to the outer and\ninner pressure many intelligent people\nend up tying their self-esteem\nself-worth and identity to their\nintelligence and ability to always do\nthings perfectly\nin his blog nemco explains that due to\nintelligent people being aware of their\nown intelligence and how highly regarded\nIt Is by others they tend to get wrapped\nup in it and only depend on themselves\nso they tend to rely too much on their\nown judgment Namco stated no matter how\nintelligent a person is obtaining\noutside input often leads to better\ndecisions so they may end up making\nworse decisions than do somewhat less\nintelligent people who are aware of\ntheir limitations\nmost intelligent people's careers and\nself-esteem are tied to their\nintelligence Namco said aging's\ninevitable cognitive decline tends to\nespecially hurt smart people practically\nand psychologically\nif you are considered to be one of these\nhighly intelligent people remember that\nin the end we're all human and mistakes\nare part of our lives\ndon't push people away due to Pride or\narrogance you might need them later on\nthese are just a few of the difficulties\nthat intelligent people face in their\nlives to be clear not all intelligent\npeople are arrogant or full of\nthemselves some might just seem like\nthey are\nmore likely than not they're worrying\nmore than trying to show off do you\nagree with the difficulties mentioned\nhere let us know in the comments and\ndon't forget to check out our
