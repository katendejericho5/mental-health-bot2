    "transcript": "can you imagine what it feels like to be\nstuck in quicksand that sense of sinking\ndeeper with every move as if you're\ntrapped in a struggle against yourself\nalthough that's never actually happened\nto me I know that feeling all too well\nbecause it was a defining theme of my\nlife for so long I felt like I was\nsinking into the quick sand of my own\nmind locked in a Relentless battle with\nan enemy who overpowered and overwhelmed\nme my own self- sabotage hi my name is\nNE and this is the story of how I turned\nmy self- sabotage into self love Act One\nTangled in my own web of self-sabotage\nfor as long as I could remember I had\nalways been my worst enemy every step\ntowards success was met with a\nself-imposed obstacle every\naccomplishment overshadowed by a nagging\nvoice telling me I wasn't good enough I\nremember a time when I was excelling at\nschool and top of my class then I got an\noffer to apply for a scholarship to the\nschool full of my dreams but my\nexcitement was smothered with so much\napprehension and self-doubt I began to\nsecond guess myself I procrastinated\ntelling myself that I needed more time\nto write the perfect application essay\nbut in reality I was delaying out of\nfear of failure I missed deadlines\nstarted cramming for tests at the last\nminute and my grades eventually started\nto slip and I lost my chance to make one\nof my dreams come true act two exploring\nthe hidden roots when something good\ncame into my life it seemed that I was\nsubconsciously finding ways to ruin it\nI'd pass up opportunities push away\nanyone who got close to me and abandoned\nmy goals at the first sign of trouble I\nrealized it was becoming a problem when\none of my friends called me out on it\nwhy do you break up with Jesse she asked\nme over lunch her eyes filled with\ncuriosity that must have been hard I\nsighed I don't know things were going\ngreat but it felt like it was too good\nto be true I figured I'd rather end it\nnow while things are still good and not\nyet serious but Nia you always do this\nyou always get in the way of your own\nhappiness she was as blunt as ever a\ntrue friend why because because maybe I\ndon't really believe it's going to work\nout in the end that I don't deserve to\nbe in a happy lasting relationship but\nshe wasn't having any of it why would\nyou even think that especially when you\ndon't ever at least try to make things\nwork and as her words sink in the\nrealization Dawns on me my self-sabotage\nwasn't just holding me back it was\nbecoming The Narrative of my life as I\nreflected on my self- sabotaging\nbehaviors I realized that they were\nrooted in deep-seated beliefs formed\nduring my childhood constant comparisons\nwith others and unrealistic expectations\nfrom family had left me struggling with\na lot of insecurity and self-doubt which\nhurt my sense of worth I was carrying\nthe weight of my past criticisms and\nfailures allowing them to shape my\npresent choices and attitudes I realized\nthat I couldn't continue down this path\nof self-sabotage if I truly wanted to\nlive a fulfilling life act three the\njourney towards healing and self-love my\njourney from self-sabotage to self-love\nwasn't an overnight transformation it\nwas a process that demanded\nintrospection courage and the\nwillingness to confront my fears headon\nI told the rest of my friends what I had\nrealized and they encouraged me to see C\nI reached out to our school\nwho connected me to a trusted therapist\nunder their guidance I started doing\nwhat they call Shadow work that is\ngetting in touch with that part of\nmyself that I hide from the one\nsubconsciously driving my self- sabotage\nmy shadow self it was a challenging yet\ntransformative process confronting my\nfears and insecurities in sessions I'd\nbe asked to answer painful questions\nlike why are you unwanted or why don't\nyou deserve to be happy it cut deep but\nthankfully Within their support my\nmindset began to shift and with it my\nbehaviors all the work we did in therapy\nhelped me to embrace my vulnerability\nand open up myself to others I'm proud\nto say that I've even started sharing\nand speaking up about my struggles like\nI'm doing right now with\nyou I've learned that selflove isn't\nabout perfection it's about acceptance\nIt's about embracing my flaws and\nImperfections as integral parts of who I\nam it's about recognizing ing that my\nworth isn't contingent on external\nvalidation but on my inherent value as a\nhuman being and so I continue to embrace\neach day with a renewed sense of\npossibility fueled by the love and\nacceptance I finally learned to give\nmyself today I'm so proud and so\ngrateful to say that my self-love has\nreplaced my self- sabotage turning my\nself-sabotage into selflove was a\ntransformation that required patience\nresilience and a willing nness to\nconfront my deepest fears it's an\nongoing Journey but I'm walking it with\nNewfound purpose and a Heart full of\ncompassion for myself so if my story\nresonated with you know that you too can\nbreak free of self- sabotage and that\nthe journey towards self love no matter\nhow difficult it may seem is worth every\neffort"
