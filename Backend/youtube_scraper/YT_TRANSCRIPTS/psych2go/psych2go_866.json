    "transcript": "hey psych2goers have you ever wondered\nwhat depression feels like or if you\nhave depression do you struggle with\ndescribing how it feels to others what\nmost people don't understand is that\ndepression is much more than having a\nbad day or an off week it's a mood\ndisorder that causes constant feelings\nof sadness disinterest and emptiness\nbecause it affects someone mentally\nphysically and socially most people\ndon't have a good understanding of what\nit feels like so to try to describe what\nit's like to give you a better\nunderstanding of depression here is how\nsome may experience depression on a\ndaily basis number one waking up\nexhausted and drained have you ever\nstayed up really late and woke up\nfeeling awful imagine that but every day\noften times regardless of how much sleep\nsomeone with depression gets they'll\nwake up without any energy this lack of\nenergy makes it hard for them to get out\nof bed and do daily tasks that seem\nautomatic to people without depression\nyou can think of depression as an\ninvisible weight that brings you down\neverywhere you go you may not be able to\nsee it but it's always there making life\nharder number two\nfeeling as if there's no joy in life\nhave you ever tried to pay attention to\na class you didn't enjoy at all\ntime seems to go slower and all you can\ndo is count the minutes until it's over\npeople suffering from depression might\nfeel as if there's no joy or pleasure in\ntheir life at all\nmaking them uninterested in everything\nin everyday life\neveryone has a hard time concentrating\non things they don't enjoy such as\nhomework or chores\nwhat happens when someone doesn't enjoy\nlife in general\nlikely they'll become unresponsive and\nunfocused on the world around them so\nfar do you relate to these two points\npsych2go is about encouraging people to\nopen up about their struggles comment\nbelow your story if you relate to this\nand will highlight the most impactful\none in a future video your story helps\nothers\nnumber three low self-esteem\ndo you compare yourself to all the\nmodels and influencers on social media\npeople with depression often do the same\nbut on a much larger scale it goes much\ndeeper than thinking that their body\nisn't Picture Perfect instead they'll\nrelate it to thinking that they're a\nfailure as a person family member friend\nand everything else they may see\neveryone around them living happily and\nthink it's their fault that they're\nstruggling of course that isn't the case\nsince depression is no one's fault but\njust like trying to stop comparing\nyourself to social media\ntrying to stop thinking you're a failure\nis extremely difficult\nnumber four complicated relationship\nwith food\ndo you ever eat because you feel sad\nbored or lonely\neven though you're not hungry\nmuch like eating to Pastime people\nsuffering from depression may use food\nas a coping mechanism they could ovary\nto distract themselves from how they\nfeel or to avoid feeling numb or on the\nother hand some with depression may also\nunder eat\nthey may feel too numb or uninterested\nto the point where they see all food to\nbe unappetizing in cases like this it's\nimportant you avoid phrases like you\nshould be grateful you have the option\nto eat or you're taking what you have\nfor granted instead you might want to\nlisten to why they're not eating\nhealthily and try to keep in mind that\nit's not something that can be fixed\novernight number five Everything feels\nhopeless\ndo you ever feel like things will never\nget better whether pandemic related or\nnot everyone can think of a time where\nthey felt helpless and hopeless\nbut people with depression feel hopeless\nnot just about this state of the world\nbut about themselves as well\nthey may think they'll never amount to\neverything or that they'll never learn\nhow to cope with depression\nthis constant state of hopelessness can\nlead to them feeling exhausted and\nunmotivated all the time\nnumber six unhealthy sleeping patterns\never had trouble sleeping maybe you were\ntossing and turning because you were\nnervous about a job interview in the\nmorning\nmany people with depression struggle\nwith this every night\ndepression is sometimes linked to other\nstruggles such as insomnia and anxiety\nboth of which make sleeping even harder\non the other hand someone with\ndepression could also sleep too much as\nwell since they may see it as an escape\nfrom their daily struggles either way\nhaving a healthy sleeping pattern is\nimportant for your mind and body and\nwithout one you're more likely to feel\nexhausted irritable and stressed and\nnumber seven physical pain\nimagine the worst headache you've ever\nhad now imagine getting that around once\nevery two weeks while many people think\nmental and physical health are\ncompletely separate they actually\noverlap in many ways\nfor example people depression are more\nprone to body aches headaches nausea and\nmuscle tension\nso while you may have trouble\nunderstanding the complex thoughts and\nfeelings people with depression have\nyou may be more able to empathize with\nthem knowing what physical pain is like\nso did our video help you better\nunderstand what depression feels like if\nyou haven't yet commented your story we\nencourage you to either one try now to\nhelp someone else who's in your shoes or\ntwo share this video with someone who\nmight need it thanks so much for\nwatching take care and see you soon"
