    "transcript": "foreign\nso I'm going to begin for a second I'm\ngoing to ask you all to take a few\nseconds and think about a time when you\nfelt happy\nand now I also want you to take another\nfew seconds and think about a time when\nyou perhaps felt a bit more anxious\nthe purpose of this kind of mini\nexercise is just to illustrate that all\nthese emotions that you might have felt\nare just totally normal and they are\npart of the human experience and because\nthey're in fact inevitable I think it's\nespecially important for us to have\ntools to be able to manage the range of\nemotions that we experience\nand that's today's topic for our ask an\nexpert series to those who are new here\nthe ask an expert series is a video\npodcast where we chat about mental\nhealth topics with experts\nso if you're Keen to also get involved\nlike help with the podcast series or to\nbe featured then you can get in touch by\nchecking the description box below for\nthe sign up form or just to get directly\nin touch with me Monica\npsych2go.net that's my email\nand with that I'm Monica I'm the host of\nthe series and I am a medical student I\nam really really passionate about making\nPsychiatry really accessible for\neveryone everywhere and it's just a huge\nhonor to be able to be a part of this\nproject\nand with that it is also a huge honor\nfor me to introduce our wonderful guest\ntoday to talk about managing emotions Dr\nConte\nhi and welcome thank you thanks for\nhaving me thank you for being here so\nyou've got so much wonderful experience\nand just so much that you do so I'd love\nit if you could kind of introduce\nyourself to our psych2go community\nuh well yes first of all hi thanks for\nhaving me happy to be here I am a\nlicensed professional counselor I'm a\nI'm an anger management specialist so\nI'm an anger management specialist a\nlevel five anger management specialist\nand sometimes degrees and letters don't\nmean you know you wonder what does this\nreally mean uh but they're only just a\nhandful of us in the world I kind of\nfeel proud of that designation\num but what it means is this look I have\nmore than 20 000 hours of clinical\nexperience I've been doing this work for\nalmost 25 years now and I'm really\nreally passionate I I work with I\nspecialize in working with people\nconvicted of violent crimes so I'm\nfrequently a maximum security prisons I\ntrain officers on how to handle and work\nwith people when they're struggling with\nreally intense emotions and I do a lot\nof work with people who are incarcerated\ntry to help teach them a different path\num you might have seen me on some TV\nshows I work with celebrities you know\ndifferent different people\num and I work with professional athletes\nso I'm also a sports psychologist so I\ndo work with some of the best athletes\nin the world but I so here's here's a\nreally good summary and it kind of hits\non what you introduced at the beginning\nwhich is\ntapping into those human emotions this\nHuman Experience and that is this so\nI've worked with thousands of people all\nover the world for more than two decades\nfrom celebrities to people struggling in\nsolitary confinement all over and I've\ncome to this profound realization Monica\nthat the world boils down to two kinds\nof people there are people who have\nissues and dead people so if you're\nalive you have issues we all do it's\ncalled being human\nabsolutely and I think it's the first\nthing to like really accept that because\nI think sometimes there's a lot of\npressure in being like Oh I'm just gonna\nshut down those feelings of anger those\nfeelings of anxiety and all that but\nit's about managing them and how to best\nuse them right because we can't navigate\nthe world with having for example no\nanxiety because that would be asleep\nright we wouldn't be able to perform so\nit's about how to hit that balance and\nthat's our topic for today so\num but that's a really good uh lead-in\nbecause you know in sports psychology if\nyou have no anxiety you probably won't\nperform at your best if you have too\nmuch anxiety you won't perform at your\nbest so we actually help people strive\nto have what's called optimal level\nanxiety which means of course there are\ngoing to be some nerves that's okay\nthat's a part as you said it's part of\nlife\num and it's not about escaping these\nemotions in any way sometimes people say\noh anger management Specialists so you\nmust never get angry and I think that no\nthat's that's silly I'm alive of course\nI'm going to experience it's all the\nemotions it's not about not experiencing\nthem it's about how do we handle them\nwhen they inevitably arise\nso why don't we just dive in with the\nwhole\nabout managing anxiety something that is\nso common I mean everyone on a\nday-to-day basis might experience some\nsort of I don't know nervousness but\nsome other people might experience\nfull-on like an anxiety disorder so how\nshould we start how do we begin this\nconversation of how to manage anxious\nemotions\nno so that's that's a great great\nquestion so here's the reality so\nanxiety is can be overwhelming it can be\nintense and actually anxiety and fear\nare neurological twins so we're just\nlooking at a brain scan we wouldn't\nreally be able to tell the difference\nwhether someone's experiencing fear or\nanxiety but here's what happens so our\nminds they really want to match our\nbodies so I think here's one of my best\nways to describe this let's say that you\nand I down three energy drinks right now\nso if we down three energy drinks our\nhearts gonna start to race and our\nbody's gonna start to mimic anxiety and\nthen our mind is going to race to try to\nmake up a story to match our bodies to\nexplain it to us so we might think oh no\ndid I did I send that email oh oh no\nmaybe I shouldn't have said this maybe I\nshouldn't have done that and then when\nwe add those intense thoughts now our\nbody shoots more adrenaline and more\ncortisol and what happens with this\nexperience appearance of anxiety is this\nit's it's like anxiety is like this big\nlike if we could just see my if you\ncould see my fist but let's say anxiety\nis this big right here now\nif anxiety is this big and then I say\nand that's just a physical feeling and\nthen my thoughts come in so this is my\nbody's feeling\num I'm shaky a little bit maybe I feel\nnervous my heart's racing sweaty Palms\nmaybe now when my body feels anxious if\nmy mind starts to race to make up\nstories oh no this is awful I can't\nstand this now it floods more adrenaline\nand cortisol which then makes my story\neven more and now it gets bigger and\nbigger and bigger\nso anxiety oftentimes comes from us\ntrying to resist the experience rather\nthan becoming mindful of and going this\nis uncomfortable I don't like how this\nfeels but and this is a key Monica there\nis a beginning a middle and an end to\nevery emotional experience that we ever\nhave\nand the more mindful we become of that\nthe more we're able to handle this\nexperience of anxiety\nabsolutely I think with the recent kind\nof push towards digital apps there are\nways to make mindfulness more accessible\nfor everyone right so when I think of\nmindfulness it's kind of like being\naware of her emotions and not fighting\nit just kind of accepting it and I like\nto practice this through mindfulness\napplications I love hudspace I love calm\nthings like that but are there any kind\nof other tools that you find especially\nhelpful to really channel that mindful\nkind of feeling so one of the first\nthings that I teach people to do is\nimagine that if you're if I'm like still\nsitting here but imagine there's like a\nhologram so I step outside and I look\nInward and so it's almost like I step\noutside myself and I just become an\nobserver so maybe I start to feel really\nanxious and when I step outside and I\nkind of look in where I go well that guy\nhe's his stomach's anxious oh his\nheart's racing a little quickly oh look\nhis thoughts are going pretty quickly\nbut now here's the key as I observe it\nas I become the Observer I don't have to\ntake on those thoughts I don't have to\nrun with those thoughts I simply become\naware of them and I think that's the\npiece that I'm trying to if I can reach\nin people's hearts out there who's\nstruggling with anxiety and have you\nunderstand\nbecause sometimes people say well what\nif I'm not doing it right and then they\nbeat themselves up about that and I\ndon't want you to beat yourself up about\nbeing mindful it's just simply awareness\ncan you be aware of what's going on with\nyour body without judging yourself\nI think as you were saying that I was\ndefinitely picturing just kind of at the\nside of like watching the sea kind of\nthe water you know like going back and\nforth and observing it but not actually\nstepping in so that's kind of how I\npictured it as you were describing and I\ndon't know if it's going to be helpful\nfor anyone else to these eyes no but\nthat's beautiful because it Ebbs and\nflows and so do our thoughts so does\nevery emotional experience we have when\nI mentioned earlier that there's a\nbeginning middle and end to every\nemotional experience we have what I\nalways teach people is this your\nemotions inevitably your emotions will\ncome and go but your actions can't be\nundone your words can't be unsaid and\nthat's why it's worth being mindful\nthat's simply because I'm having an\nexperience of anxiety or anger or\nsadness doesn't mean I have to act on it\nand the more we practice being mindful\nwhether we watch it as waves whether we\nwatch it as sometimes I teach people\nimagine your thoughts were on a train\nand you kind of just watch this train go\nby instead of jumping with every thought\non every train goes by you just kind of\nobserve and go well this is interesting\nthis guy's mind's moving really quickly\nand again there's just no judgment it's\nan observation mm-hmm I find that\nsometimes when there's that moment of\nyou know fight or flight when you feel\nlike a bear's chasing you almost\num it could be especially difficult to\njust take a step back then and so do you\nhave any thoughts or advice for when\nyou're in that kind of heated moment\nwhat do you do yes so let me start with\nthis there was a warthog in the woods\nand he was sharpening his tusks and a\nrabbit came by and he said hey I don't\nknow why you're doing that I've been\nthrough the whole woods today I haven't\nseen one Hunter there's not one Hunter\nout here and the warthog looked at him\nhe said well if I wait till I see a\nhunter it's going to be too late to\nsharpen my tasks and so one of the\nthings I tell people is this life we\nhave to train we have to train uh\nourselves these experiences take\npractice and are there things that we\ncan do if someone for instance is\nwatching in this moment and experiencing\na panic or anxiety absolutely we can\nbegin with taking breaths we can start\nwith absolute absolutely being mindful\nof our thoughts so here's one of the\nbiggest keys that we can do we can have\naccurate language for instance when you\nstart to feel overwhelmed with anxiety\none of the things that happens is as I\nsaid your body's flooded with this\nadrenaline and cortisol excess stuff and\nthen we start to tell ourselves really\nextreme words I can't stand this I'll\nnever be okay again and so we use really\nexaggerate exaggerated words and the\nmore extreme words we use the more our\nemotions are Amplified so if someone for\ninstance right now in this moment was\nstruggling with anxiety what I would\ninvite them to do was to be accurate\nwith your language in other words if I\nwere to be accurate I would say I'm\nfeeling really uncomfortable right now\nit's not the end of the world I can\nhandle it I don't like how it feels\nnow that's the immediate response as I\nsaid in terms of the warthog story and\npracticing now that's something you have\nto train yourself and practice over and\nover and the more you practice it the\nmore effective you get at doing it\nperfect I love the way that you said it\nbecause I all often also notice it\nmyself that sometimes when these moments\nof like fear anything I feel like oh my\nGod my world is falling apart but that\ndoesn't help like that absolutely does\nnot it just adds like it builds on to\nlike that physiological Sensation that\nI'm having and then that further\nreinforces that and then Builds on even\nmore you know like physiological\nsymptoms and it goes and goes and goes a\nreinforcing cycle so just take a step\nback that's it that's excellent but\nthat's that's an understanding of it and\nso I I actually do a technique I call it\nSans adjectives and that's just a fancy\nway of saying Sans is without without\nadjectives so think about this think\nabout a situation that might be anxiety\nprovoking and think about what might be\nyou might be telling yourself during it\num so if you're gonna go take a test oh\nno what if I fail if I fail this test I\nfailed this class I fail out of school\nI'll never be anything I'll never be and\nnow and then if you come back and you\ntake away all the adjectives you say I'm\ntaking a test and my body's a little\nanxious before this test and by\neliminating all those adjectives you\ntake away a lot of excess cortisol and\nadrenaline that you'd be sending your\nbody so why if I if I could definitely\nhelp any listeners out there it would be\nthis\nif you can learn to be accurate with\nyour language with what you say to\nyourself for instance this is\nuncomfortable I don't like it but it's\nnot the end of the world you are going\nto be able to handle your emotions much\nmore effectively than if you use those\nextreme words nobody likes me everybody\nno one ever listens to me everything's\nterrible well so and so didn't listen to\nme today or I didn't get exactly what I\nwanted but it's not the end of the world\nI love how applicable and like easy they\nare like they're micro tips right but\nthey're I feel like they can make really\nbig differences I absolutely love it I\nmean like I could literally practice\nthis right after the podcast so it's\nwonderful I'm very thankful for that\nwell I appreciate you saying that\nbecause so I specialize in working with\npeople convicted of violent crimes and I\nam regularly training officers on how to\nhandle very contentious situations so\nwhat I teach is real real has real world\npracticality because if it didn't people\nwould be in great danger so I had to\nlearn of the last two decades how to\nreally give techniques that are going to\nbe truly life-saving\num and and when it comes to our own\nanxiety anxiety is awful it's just an\nawful feeling anyone out there who has\nexperienced that knows\num it can just be so overwhelming and so\nyou're not wrong or bad if your mind\ngoes to these extreme words and it's not\nyou know I I really like to have people\nunderstand that like you're not I don't\nwant people to be hard on themselves if\nthey're messing it up to be able to be\nmindful to say you know what man my mind\nis being tough on me right now I am\nusing extreme words but let me practice\nthe more accurate you are the more\nyou're able to find control over\nyourself and that's really what we're I\nbelieve we're all searching for peace\nthat's ultimately what all hidden beings\nare searching for\num and being accurate with your language\ncan significantly contribute to you\nfinding peace\namazing okay I'm just gonna take a\nmoment to summarize the the tips that we\nhave the advice that we talked about for\nmanaging anxiety and then I want to go\ninto your area of expertise as well\nanger\num so we talked about the the kind of\nlike manifesting mindfulness right\nmindfulness kind of seeing things as an\nobserver trying to be more objective\nrather than kind of being so caught up\nin those those feelings those emotions\nat that time\num we also talked about being accurate\nwith our language because we know\nthe physiology I mean it's there the\nwords can further reinforce all that and\ncreate a really just a spiral so just to\nbe accurate with what's going on and\nthen trying to take a few breaths and to\nstep back and to see things from the\noutside could help with anxiety\nI know that you have so many more\ninsights why you know what we we have to\ninvite you back for I'll make the whole\nsegment on anxiety but I do want to also\nmention\num tips on how to manage anger because I\nsee right now lots of people are asking\nquestions about it so yeah let's just\ndive into\nyeah no no so this is good and this is\nthis is another one that this is really\nprofound sometimes there are many people\nout there watching no doubt who have\nexperience being angry and not knowing\nwhy like why am I angry I don't I don't\nunderstand why I'm so angry\num and it kind of links with what we\nfirst started talking about now there\nare many different drives for anger but\none of them is anxiety so think about\nthis sometimes when we are anxious\nanxious doesn't feel good at all and\nwhen as we talked about your body's\nflooded with excess cortisol which feels\nawful so when we're anxious we have all\nthis excess cortisol and then we lash\nout\nwe hit something we throw something we\nyell\nwe are releasing endorphins so physio\nphysiological physically we feel better\nsaying something out of anger than we do\nbeing anxious unfortunately we often act\nimpulsively out of anger and then regret\nwhat we did and then we feel shame and\nit can be a vicious cycle but uh but\nwhat most people don't realize is that\nsometimes we're angry because we want to\nget out of the feeling of anxiety so\nthat's one cause of anger and listen\nanger's tough man this is this is a\ngripping one for a lot of people for\nsure\nmy apologies give me a second I think\nI'm not able to hear right now so can\nyou hear me I can hear you yes I can\nhear you unfortunately my audio is not\nquite working so sorry everyone for the\num\ntrouble here\nif people can hear me I would say it's\nnot the end of the world okay\naudio\ntesting one too\nLet's test it again is this working\ntesting one two yeah I can't hear\nanything this is so interesting well\num sorry about that everyone no worries\nit's not the end of the world\nlet's see\n[Music]\nokay is that working\nI'm going to refresh this page sorry\nguys if it gets cut off I will be right\nback apologies for that I know I think\nyou guys can hear me but I cannot hear\nanything else so it'd be good to have a\nhave a good two-way chat I'm just gonna\nrefresh his page\n[Music]\nforeign\nI'm not sure people can hear me now or\nnot\nlet me see if people can hear me now or\nnot\nI'm\ncome to the top of the chat and see if\npeople can hear me\nall right hopefully this works now does\nit work can you hear me now yes here is\nis still good sorry about that um I\nthink my micro\nmicrophone no worries\nso\nsee this is a good this is a good\nexample if it's not the end of the world\nwe just take it we go we continue on\nright so if we were to use accurate but\nthis is kind of cool because it's kind\nof a great Hands-On lesson if we use\naccurate language we say okay there was\na little disruption in the way we were\nable to communicate but it's not the end\nof the world\nyou know absolutely I I will lie there I\nfelt like I was sweating a bit but you\nknow what I took a step back I was like\nDr Conti just told me a few moments ago\nto use accurate language and that is\nlike my world's not over it's just a\nlittle bit of a technological failure\nbut it's okay no it's cool and and I\nthink it's almost it's kind of it's neat\nbecause I really believe things happen\nfor a reason I like that I buy into that\nand it's and it's very fitting because\nthen when things happen I can say okay\nI'm sure there's a reason we can learn\nfrom this but this is a wonderful\nexample if we're gonna go and move on\nwith the concept of anger because I have\nwhat I believe if I could summarize what\nI think really encapsulates the majority\nof anger it's this there is a difference\nbetween what I call the cartoon world\nand the real world so the cartoon world\nis our world of shoulds people should\nthink feel believe and behave the way I\nthink they should it and then there's\nthe real world how people actually think\nPhil believe and behave and what happens\nis this Monica as long as we align our\nexpectations with our cartoon world\nwe're let down hey microphones should\nnever go out\num you know there should never be\ncomputer glitches real world there are\ncomputer glitches sometimes so if we\nwere too bought into this we would\nexplore we would crumble we wouldn't be\nable to go on with the interview because\nit would say No it should have never we\ngo it's not the end of the world they're\nglitches so what I've taught for the\nmajority of my career is this teach\npeople how to align their expectations\nwith reality\nthe more prepared you are for reality\nthe more effectively you're gonna\nencounter it and so a ton of anger stems\nfrom people living in that cartoon world\nand saying they shouldn't have said that\nshe shouldn't have said that he\nshouldn't have done that and it's not\nthat the cartoon world is isn't logical\nsometimes it's very logical the\nunfortunate reality is that as logical\nas it is it's not actual reality and so\nthat's what we that's what you know a\nhuge part of angers about learning to\nalign your expectations with reality\nso part of that when I was hearing you\nspeak kind of gave me the idea that it\ncomes down to planning sort of like\nsometimes walking through what a\nsituation might look like and actually\nplanning how you would react or actually\nmentally\nkind of going through the motions of\nexperiencing that anger and then\nde-escalating and things like that is\nthat something that we could do to\nactually better align expectations with\nreality or do you have any other\ntechniques no I love that so that's\nwonderful and I'll tell you why that's\nso helpful so let's say that we were\ngoing to run an obstacle course and\nsomeone tells us that we have four\nobstacles so we get over the first two\nthree we get over the fourth one and\nthen we hit a fifth one and we look at\neach other and say hold on a second\nthere shouldn't be five there should\nonly be four we were told there should\nbe four and so we're angry now we let's\ngo backward and we're gonna start again\nand this time someone tells us they're\ngoing to be six obstacles so we get over\none two three four we get over five but\nwe're done and we go oh that's cool now\nwhat happened in both cases we had five\nobstacles the first time we told\nourselves in our cartoon worlds this\nshouldn't be here and uh and I can't\nstand it right and then this second time\nwe say it's we were prepared and we were\nready for it and so understanding this\nso now I take this concept to what I\ncall the lifelong obstacle course as\nlong as we're alive we're going to\nencounter obstacles and so if we align\nour expectations with that reality we're\ngoing to be more prepared for it and\nlike that word hard work word hog\nsharpening his tasks we're going to\ncontinually be prepared mentally for\nanything that we might encounter\nabsolutely and any other tips for kind\nof managing I don't know different sort\nof scenarios like when people think of\nroad rage for example does that still\napply or you know is that sort of\nsomething a totally different thing or\nis it kind of suggestion oh no this is a\nkey to road rage because think about\nthis how many times do people drive into\ntraffic and say this shouldn't be here\nthis person shouldn't have cut me off\nwait that's reality this person did cut\nme off and so think about watch watch\nhow our words our self-talk amplifies\nthe situation a car cuts you off and so\nyou say he shouldn't have cut me off I\ncan't stand it people are so\ninconsiderate and you go off and now\nyou're starting to talk all about that\nyou're angry as can be versus remember\nthat Sans adjectives Technique we go a\ncar this is real world a car did cut me\noff a car drove closer to my car than I\nwanted it to it didn't hit me it's not\nthe end of the world I can handle it now\nthe same situation but vastly different\nexperience so absolutely does this apply\nwith with road rage because oftentimes\nroad rage stems from people living in\nthat cartoon world this shouldn't be\nhappening this line of traffic shouldn't\nbe here today you know and real world is\nit is here and so again now here's the\ndeal and this is profound and I I can\nsense even from talking to you that you\nreally understand this it's it's not\njust about knowing it here it's about\npracticing it so whereas I say that the\nconcepts that I work really hard to make\nConcepts super easy for people to\nunderstand but just because a concept's\neasy to understand here doesn't mean\nit's easy to live here so this takes\neffort it takes practice and oftentimes\nI hear on my own YouTube channel I hear\npeople say yeah but this is so hard I'm\nnot saying it's easy I'm saying it's the\nway it is helpful I'm not saying that\nit's that it's easy at all it definitely\ntakes work and effort but what I will\nsay is this the more you practice it the\nbetter you get at it\nI love how you bring that point up\nbecause truly there's one different it's\ntotally different to know the theory and\nit's totally different to know how to\nactually apply it so I kind of like to\ninterpret situations where there might\nbe something nerve-wracking or something\nthat is like anger provoking as a\nlearning experience to better practice\nthese tools that we've talked about so\nchanging language being more Mindful and\njust really seeing it as an opportunity\nto better be that person I want to be so\nI loved how you brought up that that\npoint well I appreciate that and I would\noften tell people if I if I gave you\naccess to the best most state-of-the-art\nexercise equipment in the world you say\nokay I'm ready to go get in shape doc I\ncan you got me this membership I'm gonna\nI have all the best equipment in the\nworld all right cool now I can't do that\nbut here's what I can do for you\nif we know that if we want to train and\nbecome more patient we have to\nexperience things that will test our\npatients and if we want to get more\neffective at our self-talk using\naccurate balance self-talk then we need\nto be put in situations that will help\nus get better at it just like a boxer\nneeds a person to hold up those bags or\nyou know gets a sparring partner because\nthat's how you train so here's what I\ncan offer all of your listeners all over\nthe world is a free lifetime membership\nto a world that will frustrate you it\nwill give you a free lifetime membership\nto a planet that is going to have people\nfrom your cartoon world who are going to\nlet you down\num and then what if you were to look at\nevery experience as an opportunity to\nget better at being in self-control no\nmatter what happens around you imagine\nhow powerful that can be so I specialize\nas I said working with people convicted\nof violent crimes and I had a center for\npeople people in South Lake Tahoe\nCalifornia once they got out of prison\nthey were mandated to come to these\ngroups and one of the things I would\nhave the guys do is this I would say one\none week I would do this exercise and\nI'd say listen this week everybody that\nyou encounter you don't know that I\ndidn't go through and make animatronic\npeople and I set that situation up to\ntest you because I want to see if you\ncan practice these and I would say in a\nlighthearted way but I'll never forget\none time I had a guy come back and he\nsaid doc you know what I actually had a\nmoment in the grocery store where I\nthought when this person did something\nreally rude I thought wait a minute is\nDr Conti is he testing me here he says\nwell I was real kind to the person who\ncut who like pushed their buggy in front\nof mine or whatever and he said I was\nreal kind because I was like I didn't\nknow if you were testing me I said\nlisten that's awesome that means you had\nthe ability to re-evaluate how you\nexperience that situation in the present\nmoment and you maintain control worst\ncase scenario is you handled that\nsituation really well\nthat's amazing as you were saying that\nit really showed me the connection\nbetween like the physiology the way that\nwe sometimes don't have control but our\nbody will act and then the way that we\ncan kind of mediate that by the way that\nwe interpret the situation by the way\nthat we carry things out so it's just\ntruly amazing that the way that our\nbodies work and uh I loved all the tips\nthat you've given us so far I know that\nyou have so much more sorry I didn't\nwant to cut you off no no no but I was\ngonna if you have time I'll tell you a\nstory a little I like to teach through\nstories storytelling absolutely\nso there was a young man\num who was being picked on at a\nmonastery and so he's at this Monastery\nhe's being picked on and um he goes to\nsee the Headmaster and he said all these\nmonks here are picking on me they're\ncalling me names and the Zen master he\nkind of sat there in silence for a\nminute he didn't say anything and the\nyoung man he got angry he said I don't\nthink you're listening to me I said all\nyour monks are picking on me it's not\nit's not fair it's not right and the\nmaster sat there in silence for a moment\nyoung man got even anger he said oh now\nyou're taking their side oh this is\nmessed up you're supposed to be Mr holy\nand now you're taking their side so\nfinally the master spoke he said give me\nyour legs and the young man said what\nare you talking about I'm trying to tell\nyou they're picking on me and the master\nlooked at him and he said cut off your\nlegs and give them to me right now and\nthe young man said no no and the master\nsaid why is it that you defend your body\nso fiercely that you give away your mind\nso easily\nthat's a beautiful story wow\nit's powerful because think about how\nmany times we give away our mind so\nsomeone cuts you off in traffic the car\ndrove closer to your car than you wanted\nit to and now you not only give that\nperson your energy in that moment but\nmaybe you dwell on it now you're taking\nthat moment into the future moments and\nnow all of a sudden this person this\nexperience has captivated your mind and\nnow you are a puppet to this situation\nor oftentimes you're a puppet to someone\nwho's not even nice to you they're angry\nthey say something mean to you and now\nyou think about that all day long and\nyou've become their puppet rather than\ngoing you know what I'm not going to\nallow that person to what we call rent\nspace in my head for free I'm not going\nto allow that to happen\nso that just took my understanding of\nthe idea of living rent free in your\nhead to another level truly stories just\nillustrate and show me so much a horror\nso thank you for sharing that definitely\namazing I feel like in just like 30\nminutes I've learned so much I don't\nknow about the community let me know\nguys what do you guys think isn't this\namazing this is wonderful and I know\nthat you've got a book as well where you\nhighlight so many wonderful other\ntechniques so would you like to tell us\na bit more about your wonderful book I I\ndo and I this is my 10th book now so\nI've written some books but walking\nthrough anger is a legacy book for me\nand I know it says anger so sometimes\npeople might say well I'm not struggling\nwith anger but here's what happens with\nthis book my wife always wanted me she\nwanted me to name it something\ndifferently because she said it's really\nabout the human mind the human psyche\nand it is so it is about how to handle\nyour own intense emotions anger anxiety\ndepression\num shame it's also how you can handle\nand speak to people whenever they are\nstruggling with anger anxiety depression\nall those different things how do you\ncommunicate so I developed an approach I\ncall yield Theory back in the late 90s\nit's now an evidence-based approach but\nit's all about meeting people where they\nare and getting around their fight or\nflight response and speaking in ways\nthat can be heard so you had mentioned\nearlier about like a bear\num if a bear you know comes in a room I\nalways tell people this is kind of a\ncool thing to understand this if a bear\nwalks in the room immediately your fight\nor flight response goes off it sends a\nmessage to your adrenal glands and says\nwatch out and now you're either gonna\nfight fight that bear flee from it run\nfight flight or freeze so here's what's\nso cool Monica in 2022 here's what we\nknow from Neuroscience it's so\nspectacular as equally as a bear\ntriggering your fight or flight response\nthat same fight or flight response goes\noff when your love everyone looks at you\nand says\nwe need to talk and in the same way it\ntriggers that intense emotions and not\njust that it's any kind of extreme words\nyou never listen to me you always do\nthat and now how do you when you're in\nthe midst of those intense emotions how\ndo you get around that fight or flight\nresponse and speak in ways that can be\nheard so I developed an approach on it's\nnow an evidence-based approach on how to\ndo that it's called yield Theory and\nthat's what walking through anger is all\nabout and if you like those uh stories\nand if your audience likes those little\nZen Tails I tell probably over 100 of\nthem in that book and you'll have a\ncouple other books like life lessons and\nteaching stories that are simply just\nthose like I'll just do like a one to\ntwo page story with a lesson\num yeah teaching stories and life\nlessons are similar books like that so\nI'm real passionate about teaching and\nbreaking things down for people for sure\nyou did an amazing job today and I\nlearned so much I think the community as\nwell just benefited greatly from the\nchat today so thank you so much for your\ntime thank you for joining us thank you\nfor having me I really appreciate it I\nappreciate how you receive information\nand take it in and then summarize it and\nstuff
