all so much for\nthe support I can't believe we did this\nI'm very very grateful for everyone here\num so my name is Monica I've started to\njoin this like to go team since 2017\nwhen I was just the second year in\nUniversity and it's been a really nice\nJourney since so uh since then I\nfinished a postgrad neuroscience and now\nI'm studying medicine and I love to\nshare my love for Psychiatry my love for\nNeuroscience through the interview\nseries that we have so hopefully you\nguys will be able to watch the next ask\nan expert series coming soon\nand yeah we've got tons of fun things\nplanned for today including the fact\nversus fiction part which is going to be\ncoming up right now so if you're curious\nto learn about some of the myths some of\nthe facts and just have a great\ndiscussion then\num stay tuned to the end for that\num so we should we just get started with\nsome of the questions or um maybe you\nguys can type in where you guys are all\nfrom I'm quite curious as well just to\nlearn a bit more about our community\nhmm\noh hi oh I'm looking at the comments now\nI was so nervous I forgot that there's\nconversations happening down here I know\nhey everybody oh my goodness yeah let's\ntake a few moments to take a look oh\nsomeone's from Nepal that's really nice\nPennsylvania Pennsylvania U.S Austria\nBrazil\nPhilippines\noh from the USA that's really nice close\nby\nCalifornia\n[Music]\noh I'm like at the bottom there's so\nmany comments happening\nthis is so cool I love us so much like I\nlove you so much\nokay\nall right hi Douglas\nready Post in the comments when you're\nready to get started with the um fact\nversus fiction otherwise we'll just let\nthe kind of destinations from where\npeople are tuning in to roll in oh we\nsee a Canadian oh\nhey Ashley\num\nuh there's fireworks happening for\nanyone who celebrates Happy Diwali\num there's a lot of fireworks where I\nlive so if you can hear the bang bangs\nthat's what it is\nthese from Ontario which is also where I\njust came from so love that\nuh lightful Wings just donated your\nchannel came out on my birthday October\n4th congrats on 10 mil and your videos\nhave helped me along the way be lightful\nand all of you keep staying delightful\nthat's very sweet oh that's so cute\nthank you very much\nwax and Jane say my name\njust reading the comments\num how are you guys doing that's I love\nthat good\nhow are we doing us\nfor them\nhow are you guys doing it I love it I\nlove it it just like stood out\num yeah they're always so caring\nwell I'm doing great I'm nervous but\nI'll warm up a little bit does anyone\nelse when you get nervous do you get\nlike a twitch right here because I'm\ntrying so hard to just not just not\ntwitch\nI'll I'll keep it real with you so if\nyou see the twitch it's that's what's\nhappening\nanyone else are you guys all warmed up\nnow are you still nervous with me\nshould we start should we start what do\nwe think do we feel like we want to chat\nmore do you want to start the kind of\nfact versus fiction that's what are we\nall feeling are you ready Monica I'm\nready okay hey guys already as well\nlet's dive into the first question then\num I'm just gonna have it pop up on the\nbanner and then the idea would be that\nyou guys would comment true or false\nright in the chat\num and then we'll have a discussion\nwe'll do that all right\nso let's start with the first question\nall right so is this true or false that\nthere are effective mental health\ntreatments available\nso when people think of things like\ndepression or anxiety or OCD yeah are\nthere treatments true or false let's see\nwhat everyone thinks\nand a lot of true coming out as a bonus\nif you think that\nthere are treatments name some of the\ntreatments as a bonus if you guys want\nto comment\nall right available in what sense\neconomic social\nthat's what Sam is asking those\nquestions\njust overall what you think and then\nuh someone says totally a pine cones\num Karen's it's true\nand choose\n95 trues\ntrue true there's therapy available\nwe'll talk about that cognitive behavior\ntherapy\num meds meds they're treatments\navailable but it hasn't helped okay well\nwe're going to be talking about\num yeah let's just dive into this right\nor do you want to give more time what do\nwe think Academy infusion therapy for\ndepression everyone knows a lot yeah I\nfeel like I've been just given a way to\nanswer at this point\num but yeah so essentially there are\ntreatments available for a number of\ndifferent mental health conditions so\nlet's think about like depression right\num what is depression major depressive\ndisorder which is a type of depression\num is generally classified as you know\nfeeling low mood and then loss of\ninterest and pleasure and daily things\nthere might also be changes in sleep\nchanges in\num weight just overall causing some sort\nof distress that impedes with everyday\nfunction and when that happens for a\ncertain amount of time then sometimes\nthe diagnostic labels given to that and\nthat's called NDG so what normally\nhappens is that\ntheir treatments so it can be\npharmacological so things like\nmedications\nspecifically we'll think of things like\nantidepressants so ssris selective\nserotonin reuptake Inhibitors or there\nare things sort of geared more towards\nlifestyle changes so making sure that\nyou go for exercise you know you see\nfriends have a supportive network of\npeople and then there are other things\nlike\nnon-pharmacological treatments so things\nlike therapy things specifically like\nCBT cognitive behavioral therapy so let\nme know in the chat if you guys have an\nidea of what cognitive therapy\nbehavioral therapy actually entails I'll\ngive a few moments and we could chat\nabout that after because it's so\ninteresting it's like\nI mean it's really fascinates me with my\nresearch\num so yeah the question is if any of you\nknow what CBT is comment what you guys\nthink it is\noh we got another\num very nice message from non-stick 872\nhi Amanda Monica Yumi and psych2go team\ncongratulations on your 10 mil Milestone\ncurrently 4 35 a.m here in the UK oh my\ngoodness one tea I know that guy thank\nyou thank you so much\num let's see if anyone has commented\nabout the idea of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy\num\nso yeah the idea is that thoughts and\nfeelings and behaviors are all linked\nand there can be kind of ways that we\ncan think about certain experiences that\ncan be more helpful than others because\nas you know sometimes we don't have\ncontrol of things of the things that\nhappen to us but we do have control of\nhow we interpret the situation and how\nwe kind of make sense of it and how we\nreact\num so one of the principles of CBT\nreally is psycho education so think of\nsomeone who perhaps is diagnosed with\nMDD\nthe first step might be to kind of\nreally understand what is depression\num so it might look like going to watch\nsome of those like to go videos to learn\nabout major depressive disorder or to\ntalk to trusted individuals like doctors\nor counselors or close friends\num to really understand what the\num experience might be\nanother kind of part of CBT might be\nlike cognitive restructuring so commonly\nthere might be kind of\ndecatastrophization so recognizing when\nthings are kind of overblown then\nchanging that\num there are a number of different\ntechniques like you know CBT is also\napplied for anxiety so\num kind of breathing techniques right so\nyou can think of things like mindfulness\nor things like box breathing which do\nyou guys know what box breathing is\nat least we can all practice actually\nyeah there are effective treatments that\nare available for you at any time that\nyou need them there are tools and\nexercises that you can do whenever you\nfeel like you need a little a little\nhelp or a little moment so I'm sorry for\ncutting you off I'll let you keep going\nso like because yeah\nno no it's amazing it's true there are\ntreatments out there and uh sometimes it\ncan be discouraging I recognize when the\nfirst one doesn't work but I think with\nso many different options out there we\nwe can like hold on to some hope and you\nknow what why don't we actually practice\nbox reading what do you guys think\nokay yeah sounds good I need to I want\nto take the lead and I need to calm down\nokay I suppose so so the reason why it's\ncalled box breathing is because we're\ngoing to be kind of visualizing a box\nwhile we do this breathing technique so\non the inhale you're gonna count to four\nslowly so that's the first line of the\nbox and then on the exhale four slowly\nthat's the bottom line of the Box uh\ninhale again for four seconds and then\nexhale to complete the box so you're\ngoing to be mindful while you're doing\nthese breaths you're really going to\ntake your time try to make it as slow as\npossible for those one two three fours\num\nso I guess I'm not going to be able to\ndo it because I'm gonna I'm gonna count\nfor you guys I haven't figured out how\nto do the the breathing and the talking\nat the same time\nso let's begin\none\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nexhale one\ntwo\nthree\nfour\ninhale\none\ntwo\nthree\nfour\nexhale one\ntwo\nthree four\njob how do we feel\num\nokay that was really fun Should we do\nmore breathing that's my that's my world\nit's the calm Zen stuff\nI love it I feel like it just makes me\ninstantly feel a lot calmer so I'm\nalways I'm always there for box\nbreathing\nyeah yeah\nrelaxed not good\ngood\nand there's science behind it I'm sure\nwe've got a video somewhere but there's\na reason why those breaths help and when\nyou understand why something that you do\naffects you in another way that's again\nalmost when you educate yourself that\nway you understand this is why this is\nhappening this is why those breaths help\nthat's this is where in my body it\naffected me or this is what my brain is\ndoing\num for me that was really um helpful in\nmy healing and it's just the knowledge\nthe neuro the science behind it when you\nunderstand your body as a machine and\nhow it's working\nyou can take your power back it's not a\nmystery you're not broken your body in\nyour mind they're doing what's what they\nneed to do to take care of you you just\nhave to figure out how to communicate\nwith them and breathing\nso important\ndefinitely\nit's definitely a huge part of\num\nCBT is a huge part of I think any sort\nof therapy\num I love it it's great\nyeah\nand speaking of kind of scientific\nmethods I have another question prepared\nfor you all about the ways that we\nactually get to know the way our body\nworks specifically how our brain works\nright so\num yeah we'll dive into the next\nquestion real it's a very fun one\nactually\ntrue or false we can use the technology\nof magnets literally think of like like\nmagnets to visualize our raid what do\nyou guys think true or false\nI think I've got a lag in my responses\nyeah I think so as well there's a mix\nthere's really a mix here actually\num\nit's probably true someone someone has\njust said the answer I won't say who but\nsomeone I just said it\num true there's true false\nmood feel I cannot answer this one not\nsure\nokay okay yeah they know they know all\nright so someone has already said it\num yes I am referring to the wonderful\nmagnetic resonance imaging\num a medality that could be used to\nreally study the brain or any part of\nthe body really\num but MRI has been used to study a\nnumber of different things even my past\nresearch project uh it's what I used to\nstudy\num the occipital which is one of the\nparts of the brain\num so essentially how it works is like\nwe have a lot of water in our body and\nwater is made of H2O so it really looks\nat the alignment of the protons\num and to create a 2D image of your\nbrain so if you were to Google MRI\nimages of the brain you really get to\nsee like the structure of it and like\nit's just so fascinating love it so much\nso if you guys want to learn more\num now you know you can also learn more\nabout different kind of ways that people\ninvestigate brain structures right so\nthere's fmri functional magnetic\nresonance imaging\num there's things like pet scan so it\nuses a radioactive tracer to\npick up the metabolism of glucose uh\nwhat else there's CT scans so like\nx-rays that are done in like many many\nmany different angles there's x-rays so\ntons of different ways that we can\nreally investigate what's really going\non in our brain and try to understand\npathology but what is also normal\nso tons of fascinating things\nit always fascinates me as a\nneuroscience researcher so\nit's crazy how much we know and how much\nthere is still left to to discover but\nit's also incredible how like we as\nhumans figured out how to do that you\nknow like wow or wow\nit's yeah that's always trips me out\npeople are cool\nbrains powerful things\noh we just got a donation from James\nKennedy thank you very much as well\nthank you\noh I'm Mike Lee\nthat's a really cute picture\nand the baby with the glasses\nall righty so now that you guys learned\na bit about the clinical side you learn\nabout the ways that we can really\ninvestigate what's going on in the body\nlet's dive into the last fun fact versus\nfiction\num let's use\n1. so for this question I want you to\nimagine that you're going to perform for\na large audience for I don't know what\nlike let's say you are a Pianist you're\ngoing to perform\nand the scenario is\ntrue or false you're more memorable if\nyou perform first or last\ntype in the comments if you think it's\ntrue or if it's false\nAlexi says I'm actually a Pianist so\nthis might be useful for you to find out\nif it's factory fiction\nJorge says um more Yumi videos\nno problem more videos coming\nall right so it looks like lots of\npeople are saying true\num I feel like y'all's probably watched\na lot of psycho videos because you know\nwhat I'm talking about here at the\nPrimacy or the recency effect so in\npsychology and social psychology\nspecifically the idea of the Primacy\neffect is that people remember things\nthat\num are presented first to them and\nthings that are presented at the end so\nhence the Primacy and the recency effect\nrespectively and actually a funny story\nwhen I was a competitive pianist I would\ncompete in piano contests right and I\nknow it's definitely a correlation but\nevery time that I was randomly selected\nto play first or last those are the\ntimes that I actually placed all the\ntimes in the middle I don't think people\nremembered me or something but those are\nthe times that have not been as\nsuccessful as the other ones so uh\nthere's that uh to share so now you guys\nremember and hopefully will be useful\nfor any sort of things that you have in\nyour life\nyeah perfect so how many of you guys got\nthree out of three on that\na lot of them these guys are smart\nuh perfect\namazing we have a lot of pianists in\nthis chat as well that's really amazing\nto see\nyeah so essentially that's some of the\nfact versus fiction if you guys want to\nsee more of it also let me know in the\nchat because we can have like a segment\nof just fact versus fiction things it\ncould be fun otherwise the next set of\nquestions were gonna be very fun because\nuh Yumi here is gonna be guiding you\nthrough it so I'll pass it on to the\nweek thank you Monica I hope you guys\nhad fun with the fact and fiction so we\nare going to end off this live stream\nwith a giveaway now that we hit 10 mil\nand we are giving
