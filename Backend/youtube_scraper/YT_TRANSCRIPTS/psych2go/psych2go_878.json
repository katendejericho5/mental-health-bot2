    "transcript": "there's this really great book by\nMichael bunde called the coaching habits\nand he teaches you a concept of how to\nhelp people when they're in trouble most\nof the time you want to come in we want\nto give advice right away but he tells\nyou to stop but don't do that and number\none be curious and ask open-ended\nquestions to allow the person to speak\neverything and anything that's on their\nmind don't even ask them what's wrong\nfirst thing you want to ask is hey tell\nme what's on your mind you allow them to\ntalk talk talk speak their mind second\nthing you want to ask is tell me more\nand then talk talk talk talk again third\nthing you want to ask is hey what else\nwhen you do this you actually allow\nsomething called a emotional breath\nwhere instead of taking advice from\nstrangers and getting all crowded you\nlet them sit in their thoughts and let\nthem speak their mind and this is\nactually a really powerful concept and\nalso the power of listening"
