    "transcript": "kissing is something that carries a\nsurprising amount of importance in our\nlives we recall our first kisses we kiss\nour children we flirt with kisses we\nsympathize with kisses we're intimate\nwith kisses but what is happening\npsychologically when we kiss each other\nhere are four psychological facts about\nkissing\nnumber one you are subconsciously\nanalyzing a potential partner\nhumans are not the only creatures that\nkiss primates do it as well\nhumans have multiple uses for a kiss\nwhereas primates have few however like\nprimates kissing also serves as an\ninstinctual and subconscious function\nkissing Bridges the gap between our\nvisual analysis of our potential mate\nand our sexual analysis of our mate\nin the immortal words of share if you\nwant to know if he loves you it's in his\nkiss\nCher might not have known it when the\nsong was written but science actually\nbacks up her claim essentially according\nto waldarski and Dunbar kissing helps us\ndecide subconsciously whether or not our\npartner will make a good mate it's not\nuncommon for people to complain or\nRejoice over the quality of their\npartner's kissing abilities what they do\nnot realize is that their brain is\ncommunicating to them that they and\ntheir partner are a good sexual match\nnumber two you're bonding with your\npartner kissing is somewhat essential to\nromantic relationships some people may\nrequire less physical attention or maybe\neven avoid it as a result of past trauma\nbefore the majority outside of these\nexceptional circumstances kissing\nreleases neuropeptides including\noxytocin and vasopressin dopamine and\nopioids which have all been variously\nassociated with human pair bonding this\nmeans that kissing brings you and your\npartner closer This truly shows the\nimportance of kissing on a physical\nlevel as it affects both partners\ngoing a long time without kissing can\nhave an effect on the bond between\npartners long-distance relationships and\ncouples with a partner who travels will\nstruggle with this often luckily there\nare ways aside from kissing to maintain\na bond between partners if you find\nyourself in a relationship in which you\nare close to your partner often make\nsure to kiss them as frequently as you\ncan this can go a long way in ensuring\nthe Romantic aspect of your relationship\nstays alive\nnumber three motives for kissing affect\nrelationship satisfaction whereas\nkissing for goal attainment or\ninsecurity was more present in\nrelationships with lesser relationship\nsatisfaction sexual and or relational\nkissing is when your motivation for\nkissing is influenced by Passion this\ncan be a kiss that is sexually charged a\nkiss out of love a gentle kiss out of\nboredom or comfort with your partner or\na kiss that comes from sympathy this all\ncommunicates passion to your partner it\ncommunicates genuine love and attachment\nto your partner and it should never be\none-sided once Partners should feel just\nas passionately to ensure a greater\nchance at relationship satisfaction the\nother motivation is far less likely to\ncommunicate healthy love and attachment\nattainment and or insecurity kissing is\nwhen your motivation for kissing someone\nis influenced by a degree of desperation\nkissing for attainment would be using a\nkiss to soften someone enough to get\nyour way if you only kiss your partner\nwhen you want something or think it'll\nhelp get you out of trouble when you've\ndone something wrong to your partner her\nand they'll pick up on this and it will\nhurt the relationship that being said\nthere could be a range of factors in the\nrelationship that would affect why one\nor more of the partners would learn this\nBehavior attainment or insecurity\nkissing can also refer to kissing\nsomeone as Revenge kissing someone to\nboost self-esteem or reputation or\nkissing someone to make someone else\njealous and number four\nkissing is like a drug\nhave you ever felt like you're addicted\nto kissing someone it turns out that\nthere are numerous psychological reasons\nfor this we discussed the release of\nchemicals that promote pair bonding but\none hormone that we did not touch on was\ncortisol a study by Wendy L Hill and\nCarrie a Wilson found that cortisol\nlevels decreased which essentially meant\nthat kissing can de-stress you but how\ndid we get to the point that kisses are\naddictive to the human race that no\nother species other and zoologist\nDesmond Morris proposed that humans\nevolved to enjoy kissing and to release\ngood hormones each time as a result of\nthe way early humans would have fed\nthat's with mothers chewing up their\nfood and feeding it to their young lips\nto lips this would partly explain why we\nfeel good especially less stressed in\nDesmond Morris proposed historical\ncontext kissing comes as a relief from\nhunger and therefore safety today that\nPrimal hormonal response persists as\nkissing gives us a sense of relief\ncomfort and safety it's no wonder that\nwe might compare it when we're in love\nto being addicted it provides us with\nsuch a strong relief as if kisses from\nour partner are drugs we can even look\nto music to see how prominent this idea\nis as we can find the metaphor of Love\nor kisses being like a drug again and\nagain your love is my drug by Kesha\ncan't feel my face by the weekend and I\nwant a new drug by Huey Lewis in the\nnews to name a few examples\nkissing is fascinating in the numerous\nways it affects us psychologically we\ncan use it to heal and to hurt we don't\nalways consider how powerful a kiss can\nbe it's interesting to consider how as a\nspecies we've adapted to kissing as a\npsychological and social tool did you\nand your partner know you are a sexual\nmatch from the first kiss let us know\nbelow"
