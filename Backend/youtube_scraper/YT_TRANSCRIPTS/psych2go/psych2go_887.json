    "transcript": "do you ever feel like something is off\nabout your relationship does it seem\nlike they're trying to take advantage of\nyou while looking well-meaning or wise\nmanipulators are Naturals at getting you\nto question your own sanity or\nperception of reality and depending on\nwho it is it can be tough to spot\nespecially if the aggressor is among\nyour close friends and family so to help\nyou be more aware of these behaviors\nhere are seven common phrases\nmanipulators use to trick their victims\nnumber one I'm the one who should be mad\nat you\nyou ever get mad at someone only for\nthem to make you feel guilty and\nembarrassed about yourself instead to\nany outbursts from your end they may\nretort with oh so you're mad even if I'm\nmistakenly Accused by you\nyou do know you're the one who's hurting\nme right this is a common manipulation\ntactic where they try to rewrite the\nnarrative and get you to empathize with\nthem even when they're the ones at fault\nthey're denying the hurt feelings you\nhave for them to get their own way for\nempaths and timid people this\nmanipulative performance can sadly be\nquite effective number two I seriously\ndon't want to argue when a manipulator\nsays I seriously don't want to argue it\nusually just means that they want you to\nstop attacking them to keep their reign\nof dominance intact they want to cut off\nany healthy and honest communication\nlines to keep you from stepping out of\nthe line in the dynamic that works so\nwell for them what makes matters worse\nis when you use the same phrase they\nthrow in their excuses saying it's not\ntheir fault and that you're the one\nbeing delusional to keep them in power\ntheir attempts to avoid any and all\narguments may be their way to\nself-enrich themselves and to keep you\nat Bay a healthy person would at least\ntry to lend an opening ear so it's a\ngood idea to be aware of the difference\nnumber three stop exaggerating\neverything\ndo you know someone who constantly tries\nto downplay a situation it can feel\nexhausting when you're upset at a\nmanipulative person since they're often\ntoo prideful to empathize understand and\nwork with you to help solve the problem\ninstead they may use underhanded\ntechniques to dismantle your argument\nstop exaggerating everything is one of\nthe phrases they may say as an attempt\nto defuse situations control the\nnarrative and keep you from lashing out\nat them even if it's clearly warranted\nin cases like this recognizing their\npatterns is always the first step to\nRising above them if it persists then\nit's always best to look after yourself\nno matter what the cost even if that\nmeans removing yourself from the\nsituation entirely number four they're\ncrazy listen to me imagine you've\nreached out to your friend to talk about\nyour relationship problems and they tell\nyou that your partner is actually very\nmanipulative when you bring this up to\nyour partner instead of keeping an open\nmind they may defend themselves by\nputting down the other person they may\nsay that your friends are the ones who\nare crazy and that they are the only\nperson who is right and who you should\nlisten to the worst part is that some\nmanipulators can be charismatic enough\nto convince you this can be severe\nenough to the point that they force you\nto stick with them at all times which\ncan isolate you from the people who\nmight go against them\nnumber five look you clearly don't\nunderstand\nthey tried undermining your arguments\nmanipulators are great at confusing\npeople and making them hesitant\nsometimes they might even act like a\nbrick wall so there's no room to\ncommunicate at all no matter how you\nfeel emotionally or how much you try to\nargue they may never make any sort of\nattempt to empathize or understand you\nin this way they evade any form of\naccountability number six no no you're\nbeing delusional have they ever said\nthat you're being delusional or crazy\nmanipulators like to shift the blame\naway from them and paint you in a bad\nlight they're not in the relationship\nfor a healthy two-way Dynamic they're in\nit so they can make themselves feel\nbetter at your expense suffice to say\nit's not healthy manipulators love it\nwhen you're nice and kind to them but\nthey're ready to discard all of that in\ncase it's not needed anymore it's a good\nidea to ask for insight from other\npeople or professionals about the\nsituation or set clear boundaries from\nhere on out and number seven now why\nwould I do that you know I love you\nmanipulators know how to skirt around\nromance and get you to fall for their\ngood side they may show their\nvulnerability during first impressions\nbut reveal their darker side once\nthey've caught your attention the most\nfrightening part for empaths and people\nwho fall victim to manipulators is that\nit's so hard to turn off the switch and\nremove the manipulator from their lives\nforever after all the experiences the\ngood times that I love use can all seem\nincredibly real but manipulators know\nthis too and may use it to manipulate\nyou further if they really cared and\nloved you they wouldn't constantly\ndismiss your feelings but have an honest\nconversation about them with you instead\nthey're normalizing in action mind games\nand dismissive emotional patterns which\nis not something a healthy person would\nresort to so has anyone ever used these\nphrases against you let us know in the\ncomments below if you
