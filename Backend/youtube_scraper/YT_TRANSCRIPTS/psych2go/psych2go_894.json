    "transcript": "maybe you've been hearing the term\ngaslighting more and more nowadays but\nwhat does it actually mean well\ngaslighting is a form of psychological\nabuse and manipulation that can lead to\nthe victim questioning their judgments\nand reality as you can already imagine\nthis can be detrimental to the health of\nothers\nhas anyone ever told you something like\nthat's not how normal people act you're\nimagining things or you're acting out\nthese are all phrases used by people who\nmay just be gaslighting you into\nconfusing you about how you feel think\nor behave in order to manipulate you\ninto doing something they want\ngaslighting can be a weapon used by many\nfor psychological manipulation after all\nif you can't believe yourself who can\nyou believe so here are six types of\ngaslighting to be aware of number one\nquestioning your mental well-being it's\nno surprise that someone who wants to\nmanipulate you will try to make you\nquestion your overall mental state\nthe aggressor may ask you questions such\nas do you hear yourself or you know you\nsound crazy right now right using these\nsorts of terms to destabilize your\nself-confidence allows the aggressor to\nplay you into their hands by convincing\nyou that there is something wrong with\nyou or that you aren't in your right\nmind\nthis can be one of the most direct types\nof gaslighting that others may use in\norder to make you more unsure of\nyourself leaving your own ideas and\nthoughts in question it can be\nintimidating and scary to face these\nsorts of people\nespecially if your self-esteem is low\nnumber two\nplaying the victim\ngaslighting isn't always about directly\nfooling or blaming others sometimes\nothers can fake being overly hurt or\nupset by things that you say\ndo you ever talk to someone about\nsomething they did that hurt you only\nfor them to fall apart they may use\ndifferent types of behaviors to make you\nfeel bad about approaching them about\nyour feelings such as making threats to\nthemselves or others crying or even\ngoing as far as to shut you out or cut\nyou off this type of gaslighting is\nusually used because the person is\ntrying to avoid issuing an apology to\nyou or acknowledging your feelings in an\nhonest manner if it seems as though\nevery time you try to speak to someone\nabout their behavior you leave the\nconversation feeling bad for them\ninstead of feeling like you had an\nhonest conversation you may be\nexperiencing a type of victim playing\ngaslighting number three rewriting your\nmemory\ndo you ever feel as though you can't\nremember anything the right way when\nyou're talking to that one person in\nparticular maybe you could have sworn\nthat you remembered the way they acted\nthat one time or they're constantly\nrepeating behaviors that make you\nuncomfortable but whenever you confront\nthem they question your memory they\ncause feelings of anxiety or doubt about\nyour own memory and may use this as a\nback door to your self-confidence and\nemotions\nconfusing and disorienting a person and\ncausing them to question their own\nmemory allows gaslighters to place false\nmemories or try to assume control over\nhow you should think this is another\ninstance of gaslighting which can be\nhard to identify but the intentions\nBehind these words speak volumes if\nsomeone is attempting to help you\nremember where you left your keys before\nwork or trying to remind you of\nimportant tasks chances are that they\nmay be trying to be helpful\nbut your memory being brought into\nquestion about your feelings or issues\nis something you should be careful of\nnumber four\nI'm the only one you can trust\nalthough someone may not say something\nof this nature directly to you sometimes\nactions can speak louder than words it's\na scary concept to think that\ngaslighters may coerce others into\nthinking that the gaslighter is the only\nperson that they have but it may be more\ncommon than you think if the gaslighter\ncan trick you into believing that they\nare the only one looking out for you or\nthat they are the only person who will\ntell you the truth it can be a sign of\nmanipulation\nterms such as why would you listen to\nthem or you believe them over me may\ncome to mind when thinking about these\nsorts of people\nwhen this type of person is able to pull\nyou away from other people's help they\ncan oftentimes make you feel as though\nthey are helping you when in reality\nthey are likely the ones causing much of\nthe anxiety and stress in your life it\ncan feel like walking on eggshells\naround them even though they are\nsupposed to be the one looking out for\nyou number five minimizing your feelings\nor issues has anyone ever made you think\nthat your feelings are too intense or\nyour emotions are too powerful\nmaybe they tell you that you should calm\ndown or that something isn't really that\nbig of a deal this is a powerful type of\ngaslighting which can hinder you from\nexpressing yourself and your feelings\nyou may start to notice that you feel\nreluctant or even anxious to share how\nyou feel with others and start to\ninternalize your own issues gaslighters\nmay use phrases like I didn't hurt you\nthat badly you're overreacting\nwhere I didn't raise my voice you're\njust misinterpreting things\nor you're just too sensitive and\noverreacting\ngaslighters use these phrases to\nmanipulate the situation and make you\nseem like the problem suppressing the\nemotions of others instead of having an\nhonest conversation is a primary way\nthat gaslighters can get the upper hand\nfeelings are how we respond to\nsituations both positive and negative\nwhich gives us an idea on how to handle\nthe situation\nso trust your feelings and number six\nredirecting blame onto you\ndoes blame always get pushed back onto\nyou\nmaybe you feel like with this person\nyou're constantly messing up all the\ntime no matter what you do or how much\nyou try to fix it shifting and\nfabricating blame can be a powerful\nstrategy for gaslighters to help\nthemselves feel as though they aren't to\nblame and maintain control over others\nlearning to respect your own self and be\nemotionally aware of when you didn't do\nsomething wrong can help with this type\nof gaslighting being able to have open\nconversations and talk about why a\nproblem came up versus knowing when\nsomeone is grasping at straws just to\nput you down can help Shield you from\nthese accusations\ndo any of these types of gaslighting\nseem familiar to you
