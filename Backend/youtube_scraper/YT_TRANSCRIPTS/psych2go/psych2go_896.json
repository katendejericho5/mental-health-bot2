    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Do you have a secret crush\nand you can't seem to\nmuster up the courage\nto talk to them in person just yet?\nSo, you decide do you wanna\ntalk to them online first?\nA few texts here, social\nmedia comments there,\nand you're good, right?\nWell, you may need some\ntips to get you started.\nHere's some help on how to get your crush\nto like you online.\nNumber one, see if you\nhave mutual friends.\nDo you have mutual\nfriends with your crush?\nThe great thing about\nsocial media platforms\nis being able to see who follows who\nand who's on who's friend list.\nSo if you give your\ncrush a friendly follow\nor add them with a note saying\nyou go to the same school\nor are in the same club,\nthen after you're on their friends list,\nsee who else is.\nOdds are the social media\nsite will let you know\nwhat followers or friends\nyou have in common.\nIf you know this mutual\nfriend well enough,\nyou can reach out and ask\nthem about your crush.\nIf you trust them, go ahead\nand ask if they'll be your wingman,\nor maybe if they can invite your crush out\nto their next outing, which\nyou'll be invited to as well.\nThen, you can have an easier\ntime getting to know your crush\nbecause your mutual friend\ncan introduce you to them.\nIf you're not quite comfortable\nwith admitting who your crush\nis to your mutual friend,\nyou can always message your crush\nasking how they know your mutual friend.\nIt starts a conversation and\nit shows you know them too.\nSo, they may just trust you more\nand feel comfortable messaging you.\nNumber two, get to know them\nand show you care about them.\nHave you shown any of\nyour passions and hobbies\nthrough social media posts?\nWell, now that they know a bit\nabout you through your posts,\nfind out what they like to do as well.\nGet to know them.\nIf they posted about a\nmovie they really liked,\ndiscuss it with them.\nIf they shared a photo of themselves\nthat reveals a hobby of\ntheirs, ask them about it.\nGet to know your crush a\nbit by asking about them,\ntheir hobbies, interests, and passions.\nIf you have something in common,\nrun with it and keep\nthe conversation going.\nGrow it towards more\nthan a shared interest,\nbut a discussion about why you both love\nwhat it is that you're passionate about.\nWhat about it to you makes\nit your one and only passion?\nThey'll likely share what drew them\nto their passions initially too,\nor why they got into their career,\nor what's going on lately in their life.\nThe point is to not only get to know them\nbut to show them you care by listening,\nasking follow up questions,\nand expressing your genuine\ninterest when possible,\nNumber three, find something interesting\nyou both have in common.\nSimilar to point two,\ndo you have something in\ncommon with your crush?\nTry to find something interesting\nthat you both have in common.\nIf you find something more\nunique that you have in common,\neven better.\nThis will bring you closer\nand give you something\npersonal to talk about.\nYou may even develop\na private joke or two,\nwhich can bring you closer together.\nOnce you have something in common\nthat's unique or interesting,\nit could set you apart\nfrom their other friends,\nwhich means they may\nbond with you even more.\nNumber four, post about something\nthat you have in common with them.\nOkay, so now you've\ngotten to know them better\nand you've found out\nthat you have a few things\nin common with them.\nTo catch their attention more,\npost about your shared interest.\nSo let's say you both enjoy skiing.\nPost a photo of your latest skiing outing.\nIf they comment on it,\nyou can then casually invite them out\nto your next ski outing.\nOr maybe you don't get\nmuch snow where you live.\nHow about posting an update on a book\nby the author you both love.\nIf they comment on it,\nthis is a good sign.\nThen, you have an easy way of starting up\na conversation again with them\non the topic you posted about.\nNumber five, text some\nopen-ended questions.\nWhile texting,\nit's a good idea to keep\nthe conversation going\nwith some open-ended questions.\nAvoid simply yes or no questions.\nOr look out for how they reply.\nIf you notice they don't ever\nask questions back to you,\nit's a likely sign that\nthey're not that interested.\nIf they only text back\nbrief yes or no responses,\nthey might not be into keeping\nthe conversation going.\nIt shouldn't just be you\nwho's asking the questions\nin your discussions, but\ngenerally don't turn away\nfrom asking some friendly\nquestions when they arise.\nWho knows, the more you\nboth get to know each other,\nthe more you may start to like each other\nwhether that be as romantic\npartners or friends.\nAnd number six, be\ngenuine and be yourself.\nAre you your genuine self\nwhen you text your crush?\nIt's important not to\npretend you are someone\nbesides your true self.\nThe impression you're trying to give off\nshould be authentic to who you are.\nOnce the conversation starts flowing,\ndon't overthink things\nand just run with it.\nAsk some questions, respond truthfully,\nand don't worry about seeming perfect.\nIf you make a silly mistake,\nyou may just come across as relatable.\nYou'll wanna partner who\nis compatible with you\nand perhaps one day,\nlikes you for being you.\nIt's best not to be anyone\nelse besides yourself.\nSo, how will you start a conversation\nwith your crush online?\nOr will you approach them in person first?\nFeel free to comment
