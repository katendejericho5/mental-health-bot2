    "transcript": "don't tell people to play hard to get\nlet's find out why in debunked with Psy\nlet's go back in 1973 five experiments\nwere done with college age males in\nevery experiment the participants\nconfirmed they'd rather ask out someone\nwho reciprocates their feelings rather\nthan someone who flirts with everyone or\nno one in 2015 another study was done\nwith teenagers where they came to the\nsame conclusion think about it would you\nslide into someone's DMS if you knew\nthey were flirting with a bunch of other\npeople or showing no interest at all\nprobably not earlier this year another\nstudy was published where they found\nthat their strategy will backfire if\nyou're pulling away too much your crush\nmay think that you're not interested at\nall and stop pursuing literally the\nopposite of your goal so what did we\nlearn ultimately playing hard to get\npaints a false picture of yourself to\nothers and tends to push away anyone you\nreally want a shot with so take a deep\nbreath and let them know you like them\nit may work better than you think"
