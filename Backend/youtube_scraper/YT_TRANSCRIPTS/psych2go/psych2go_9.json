    "transcript": "- Everyone has the\nability to manipulate even\nas young kids we lie\nand deceive our parents\nor at least we try as we grow\nand learn about ourselves\nand other people the\nmanipulation tactics we encounter\nbecome more sophisticated it\ncan be hard to distinguish\nbetween manipulation and\nhonesty so we decided\nto explain the most comprehensive list\nof manipulation tactics\nas fast as possible\nready let's go aggressive jokes\nwhen someone makes a joke at\nyour expense they're not\nonly trying manipulate you\nbut also those around you this\ntactic is used to exclude you\nand make you feel like\nan outsider the person\nwho makes the jokes will often\ndownplay what they've said\nor brush it off as just a joke\npurposefully making you feel\nbad anger\nand fear emotions can be\neffective tools of manipulation\nfor example getting angry at\nyou over something very small\ncan be a way to control you\nand keep you in line they\nmay also gaslight you into\nthinking that their emotional\nresponse was appropriate\nand valid when it was not blackmail\nblackmailing is when\nsomeone has information\nor evidence about you it can be used\nto threaten you into doing\nsomething you don't want\nto do blackmail can be a\ncriminal offense in some cases\nblaming playing the blame\ngame is a manipulation tactic\noften used in relationships\nif someone is particularly\ninsecure they may blame\nyou for their mistakes\nto alleviate their guilt\nor embarrassment boundary\nviolation manipulators want to see\nhow far they can push you if\nthe boundary you have set is in\nthe way of something they want\nfor example if they want a\nsexual and you do not they may push\nor even break that boundary\non purpose boundary pushing is\nusually paired with guilt tripping\nor gaslighting to make\naction seem less distressing\nchanging the subject when a\nmanipulator is caught in the lie\nor is embarrassed about being\nwrong in some way they will\nchange the subject to\ndistance themselves from their\nbehavior later on they might\ntry to gaslight you by changing\nwhat they said or\nexplaining things in a way\nthat is more favorable to them\ncoercion coercion covers a\nfew other manipulation tactics\nlike blackmail guilt tripping\nit refers to the general goal\nof trying to convince you\nto do something you don't want to do\ncriticizing manipulators need\nyou to feel insecure in order\nfor their tactics to work they\nmay disguise their criticism\nas care or thoughtfulness\nwhen that is not the case\nmanipulators will then immediately\nfollow up their criticism\nwith a solution that benefits them\ncrowd manipulation using strong\nand emotional words is a\nway politicians often use\nto influence crowds into\nbelieving a situation is more dire\nor more positive than it\nis manipulating a crowd\nto get them riled up or\nexcited is typically done\nby appealing to the crowd's emotions\nor flattering them denial it\nis extremely common for people\nto deny what they've done when\nthey've done something wrong\nit typically happens when an\ninsecurity has been exposed we\nlearn this behavior from a\nvery young age everyone knows a\nkid who would say i meant to\ndo that when you confront them\nand tell them they messed\nsomething up downplaying when a\nmanipulator is called out\nfor their behavior they may\ninstinctually downplay it this\ncan often be self-deprecating jokes\nor overly long explanations\nfor their actions they may try\nto make it seem as though\ntheir actions are actually\nfor the greater good emotional\nblackmail if a manipulator\nknows what affects you\nemotionally they may try to use\nthat against you a common form\nof emotional blackmail is\nthreatening self-harm fake\nmoralization when a manipulator\nknows you will disapprove\ntheir true intentions they\nmay try to disguise it\nas virtuous this can present\nitself in numerous ways\nclaiming to be oppressed\nflaunting their good virtues\nor trying to tell others\nwhat is and isn't good\nor forms of manipulation tactics\nthat would fall under fake\nmoralization this can be an\nespecially difficult tactic\nto detect some people\nare genuinely oppressed\nor they want to call out harmful behavior\nso it can be difficult to\ntell whether they're trying\nto manipulate or be helpful\nflattery sometimes manipulators will try\nto win you over using flattery an example\nof this would be if someone\nsaid to you you're smart\nso i'm sure you would agree with me\ngaslighting gaslighting has come up a lot\nso far it is a common deceitful\ntactic where the goal is\nto convince you that\nwhat you know is wrong\nand has been wrong the whole\ntime gaslighting can come\nwith blaming denial\nand downplaying if you\nhave five easter eggs\nand they took one they'll try\nto convince you they were\nonly four the whole time\ngeneralizing generalizations\nare made to convince you\nof something they could\nbe using stereotypes\nor oversimplifying to purposely\nmake things appear better\nor worse generalizations can\noften be be vague saying things\nlike well you know how they\nare implying that someone\nor a group of people can be stupid\nor overly sensitive as\ngeneralization designed\nto make you feel like\nyou're part of something and\ntherefore more likely to side\nwith a manipulator ghosting\ntypically used in relationships\nghosting is the act of disappearing\nor ignoring someone who's\ntrying to contact you the goal\nof ghosting is to keep you unsure\nand insecure about your relationship\nand to influence you to believe\nthat they're so important\nthat your time with them is precious\nand should be cherished more\nguilt tripping guilt tripping\nis another way to use your\nemotions against you they'll use\nguilt to shame you for doing\nthe things you want to do\nand for going against their\nwishes they can use anything\nfrom religion to dead relatives\nto make you feel guilty\nhoovering this is when someone\ntypically a romantic partner\nchanges their behavior when the\nrelationship is nearing its end\nif you ever get to the point\nof wanting to break up or\nif you show some indication\nthat you may leave them they\nwill change their behavior in\ndrastic ways suddenly they are\ndifferent person making large\ngestures love bombing\nor making threats of self-harm\nto suck you back into the toxic\nrelationship infantilization\nthis is when someone speaks to\nyou as though you're a child\nor mentally impaired to make it known\nthat you are not well respected\nor that you are not in the\nmanipulator's intellectual level\nisolation in relationships a\nmanipulative partner may see\nyour family and friends as\nthreats so they will try\nto manipulate you into separating\nyourself from them from\nthere you will become entirely\nreliant on your partner\nand they will be able to\nslowly control every aspect\nof your life love bombing\nthis tactic is especially\neffective for people who lack a sense\nof love in their lives\nif someone comes along\nwho pours an impossible amount\nof love on you it can be enough\nto get you to do anything\nfor them this love doesn't last long\nhowever once they have\nwhat they want it will show\nyou little to no attention\nor even ghost you lying lying\nis probably the most commonly\nused manipulation tactic\navoiding the truth\nand influencing what people\nknow is the most basic\ninstinctual tactic we know\nbecause it is so easy to lie a lot\nof other manipulation\ntactics are just grand ways\nof lying passive aggression\nby being passive aggressive\nthe manipulator can't be called\nout they can easily claim\nthat they were just\njoking not being sincere\nor not being purposefully\naggressive playing on insecurities\nthis is another tactic in the same vein\nas emotional blackmail\nor guilt tripping where it is done\nto use your emotions against\nyou the manipulator might say\nthey love you despite your\ninsecurities making you feel like\nothers wouldn't put up with the things\nthat make you feel insecure\nthey may also exploit\ninsecurities like a fear\nof getting cheated on\nby joking about cheating\nor excusing cheating projection\nwhen someone is trying\nto manipulate you with\nprojection they will turn the\naccusations back on you if you try to say\nor do anything to resist their\nmanipulation they will claim\nthat you're trying to\nmanipulate them for example\nsomeone might be trying to\nguilt trip you if you don't give\nin or if you call them out\nthey will turn it around\nand say something like you're trying\nto gaslight me into the\ni'm a bad guy you're trying\nto manipulate me they have\nprojected their bad behaviors\nonto you to avoid\ncriticism shaming similar\nto guilt tripping the goal of shaming is\nto make you feel bad\nwhere guilt tripping is\nusually used when you're going\nto do something shame is often used\nfor something you've already\ndone this can have many effects\nin different contexts in\nrelationships shaming someone can\nbe a way to control their behavior\nand make them want the\nmanipulator's approval shifting the\ngoal post when someone shifts\nthe goal post they are the\nagreed upon rules to benefit\nthemselves your boss might ask\nyou to do something very\nspecific when you do it\nand it doesn't work they try to change\nwhat they wanted this is done\nto make them appear more virtuous\nwhen things don't work out\nfor them or so\nthat they aren't responsible\nwhen things go poorly smear\ncampaigns a smear campaign is\nwhen someone spreads negative\nrumors or disinformation\nabout you to manipulate\nwhat people think of you\nand to damage your reputation\nthe silent treatment this is\nanother manipulation tactic\nthat many of us learn a very\nyoung age usually used in\narguments the silent\ntreatment puts the burden\nof communication onto the\nother person it's also used in\nrelationships when someone feels\nthat their partner is not\nfulfilling their needs rather than\ntalking about it they stay\nsilent to make their partner feel\nas guilty and stressed out about it\nas possible threatening we\nalso learn about threats from a\nyoung age they're fairly straightforward\nwith a manipulator telling you\nwhat they will do if you go\nagainst them in relationships an\nexample could be if and you\nin examples if you go out\n- With your friends denied\ni will break up with you\nas you can tell from this\nexample threats can also pair\nwith other tactics like\nisolation triangulation\ntriangulation is a\nmanipulation tactic that aims\nto exclude you this can\noccur when someone goes\nto your friends and tries to get them\nto turn against you this is often done\nto get your mutual\nfriends to go against you\nas well it always involves\nother people having\nto choose the right side\nit doesn't just apply\nto friend groups parents\nmay also ask their kids\nto choose their side dividing the family\nto be against the other parent victimhood\nfinally victimhood is used\nby manipulators to try\nand milk people for their pity\nand compassion this can be\nespecially effective if they make\nit seem as though you're the\nonly person who can help them\nhow do we do are there any\nmanipulation tactics we didn't\ntalk about let us know in the\ncomments below the best way\nto defend yourself against manipulation is\nto be firm when you disagree\nwith someone back away from\nsomeone if you feel like they're\nmanipulating you and get\nsomeone else's opinion if you\naren't sure if you're\nbeing manipulated remember\nto leave a like on the\nvideo if you enjoyed it\nand
