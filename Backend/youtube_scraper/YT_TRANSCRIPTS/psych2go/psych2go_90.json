    "transcript": "whether it's with your partner friends\nor family relationships are a huge part\nof our lives but lately it's seems like\nmore and more of them are turning toxic\nor has it been like this for a long time\nbut we're only realizing it now first\noff let's define what we mean by toxic a\ntoxic relationship is one where there's\na lot of negativity manipulation and\nunhealthy Behavior going on it's like a\ndark cloud hanging over your head making\nyou feel drained and unhappy so why are\nthere so many relationships like this\nthese days let's break down a few common\nreasons the wrong blueprint think about\nyour own upbringing for a moment what\nkind of environment did you grow up in\nwhat kind of relationship did your\nparents have how did your family treat\nyou our childhood experiences have a\nprofound impact on how we view\nrelationships as adults whether or not\nwe realize it it you see our family\nmembers are like the architects of our\nemotional blueprint we learn from their\nexample what love respect and\ncommunication should look like so if you\ngrew up with any unhealthy Dynamics in\nyour family say for example frequent\nshouting and yelling or a lack of\nemotional support you might\nunintentionally replicate those\nbehaviors in your own\nrelationships all about attachment ever\nheard of attachment Theory it's the idea\nthat our early experiences with\ncaregivers shape our attachment Styles\nwhich in turn affect how we relate to\nothers later in life if you have a\nsecure attachment you're more likely to\nfeel comfortable with intimacy and Trust\nin relationships but if you have an\nanxious attachment you're prone to\nconstantly seeking reassurance from your\npartners you might find yourself feeling\nclingy or needy because you have a\nstrong fear of Abandonment or rejection\nsomething you like likely experienced\nfrom your parents then there's avoidant\nattachment it's when you find it hard to\nrely on others or open up emotionally in\nrelationships you might push people away\nto protect yourself from getting hurt\nand think it's always better to leave\nbefore you left a common reason for this\nis if your parents were emotionally\ndistant or ignored your needs growing\nup Communication Breakdown Whenever\nthere was a problem how did your family\ndeal with it did you feel comfortable\nenough to open up to your family about\nyour true feelings and struggles or were\nyou ashamed for crying or told to just\nsweep it all under the rug did you grow\nup feeling like you had to lie or keep\nsecrets from your own parents effective\ncommunication is key to healthy\nrelationships but many of us didn't\nlearn those skills growing up leaving us\nUnsure how to express our needs and\nfeelings in a constructive way without\nclear communication misunderstandings\nand resentment can Fester turning a\nrelationship\ntoxic a lack of accountability in a\ntoxic household there's often a lack of\naccountability instead of working\ntogether to solve problems family\nmembers resort to pointing fingers and\ndeflecting blame it's a frustrating\ncycle that leaves everyone feeling\nmisunderstood and unheard maybe you've\nexperienced this firstand watching your\nparents engage in Endless cycles of\nblame shifting and playing the victim\nwhen no one takes responsibility for\ntheir actions growing up in this\nenvironment can normalize these bad\nhabits and while forgiveness is\nimportant it shouldn't come at the\nexpense of allowing toxic Behavior to\ncontinue familiarity breeds Comfort it's\nhuman nature to fear change and\nuncertainty even if we know it's best\nfor us if you've had negative past\nexperiences like rejection abandonment\nor emotional neglect it may cause you to\ngravitate towards relationships that\nfeel safe but ultimately perpetuate the\nsame toxic patterns it's like staying on\na sinking ship you're trying to convince\nyourself everything's fine but deep down\nyou know it's time to go if any of this\nresonates with you know that you're not\nalone many of us have been impacted by\nour past experiences and it's okay to\nacknowledge that but it's also important\nto recognize that we have the power to\nchange the narrative remember you\ndeserve love and respect in your\nrelationship with self-awareness healing\nand a willingness to grow you can break\nfree from the cycle of toxicity and\ncreate the fulfilling connections you\ndeserve so do you have any insights of\nyour own about why so many relationships\ntoday seem to be toxic we'd love to hear\nfrom you in the comments down below and\nif you're interested in diving deeper\ninto this topic check out our other\nvideos on six signs your trauma is\nmaking you lonely and do you love them\nor just attached don't forget to hit\nthat like button share this video And\nsubscribe to our channel for more\ninsightful mental health content thanks\nfor watching"
