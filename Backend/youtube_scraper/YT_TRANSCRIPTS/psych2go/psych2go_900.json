    "transcript": "have you ever wondered how to get\nsomeone to like you they may think\nyou're pretty alright whether this is a\ncrushed friend or acquaintance but you\nwant them to jump for joy at the mere\nside of you well that may not be so easy\nto happen the literal jumping but there\nare a few things that people find\nlikable do you do these things possess\nthese traits people are more likely to\nlike you if you do these five things\nnumber one you're holding a warm\nbeverage do you like your coffee hot or\niced if you prefer your beverages cold\nthen you may need to switch over to the\nhot side you may just come across as\nhotter this study does suggest you may\ncome across as warmer the 2008 study\npublished in the academic Journal\nscience\nfound that if you're holding a warm\nbeverage people may perceive you as more\npersonable the researchers conducted two\nstudies with interesting results the\nstudy States in study 1 participants who\nbriefly held a cup of hot versus iced\ncoffee judged a Target person as having\na warmer personality generous caring in\nstudy 2 participants holding a hot\nversus cold therapeutic pad were more\nlikely to choose a gift for a friend\ninstead of for themselves how sweet of\nthem see you may not only be perceived\nas sweet as the hot cocoa you're holding\non your date but hopefully as hot as it\nis too we can only dream right number\ntwo they see you in a group first do you\nhang out with your friends often in\nlarge groups no well you might as well\nsay yes to that next group outing\nbecause it may make others see you as\nmore attractive and even like you more\nresearch shows that people tend to find\nothers more attractive when they are in\ngroups than on their own this idea is\ncalled the cheerleader effect and has\nbeen proven through tests by\npsychologists to be consistent\nresearchers Edward voll and Drew Walker\nof the University of California San\nDiego conducted five experiments where\nsubjects would rate people based on\nphotographs of them they found that\nsubjects rated people more attractive\nwhen they were pictured in a group of\nthe same gender compared to an\nindividual photograph of someone\npictured alone as the study suggests\nindividual faces will seem more\nattractive when presented in a group\nbecause they will appear more similar to\nthe average group face which is more\nattractive than group members individual\nfaces number three you make small\nmistakes sometimes\ndo you often make mistakes it's time to\nRejoice your time has arrived to be\nappreciated well kind of while it's best\nto be our best selves small mistakes and\nblunders are bound to happen from time\nto time while you may think of this as\nan embarrassing or unattractive thing\nsometimes people perceive it as the\nopposite a study published in the\nJournal of psychonomic science found\nthat if you make some small mistakes but\nstill show that you are capable and\nintelligent you may be seen as more\nattractive in the study researcher\nElliot Aronson had people rate fake test\ntakers based on their attractiveness\ntest takers would either do great on a\ntest mediocre or poor the imperfection\nsome test takers would act clumsy and\nspill coffee at the end of the interview\nafter their scores were revealed people\nrated the test takers who spilled coffee\nat the end of their interview the\nhighest on the attractive scale meaning\npeople want to see you are intelligent\nand capable but that you aren't perfect\nas the research paper States a superior\nperson may be viewed as superhuman and\ntherefore distant a blunder tends to\nhumanize them and consequently increases\ntheir attractiveness poor test takers\nmediocre test takers and even great test\ntakers were still rated lower than the\nsuperior test taker who scored great and\nspilled coffee at the end others may be\nintimidated if you come across as\nperfect and make no mistakes they want\nto see your human side but when you show\nyou're capable and yet still relatable\nas a human being who makes mistakes\npeople tend to like you more\nnumber four you give people compliments\ndo you enjoy receiving Compliments are\nyou pretty good at telling when they're\ngenuine people are pretty good at\nspotting when a compliment is genuine\nversus just being polite so when you\ngenuinely appreciate something about\nsomeone let them know wouldn't you want\nto know if someone was thinking highly\nof you when we speak of others in a\npositive light people will associate the\ntraits we use to describe that person\nwith ourselves this happens when we talk\nabout someone to someone else this is\ncalled spontaneous trait transference\nand it occurs when communicators are\nperceived as possessing the very traits\nthey describe in others according to\nseveral studies published in the Journal\nof Personality and Social Psychology\nresearchers found that when we describe\nsomeone with a certain trait to another\nperson that person will associate us\nwith the trait described\num so who will you compliment next\nand number five you're a great listener\nand allow others to talk about\nthemselves too\nwho doesn't love having a caring friend\nwho is a great listener it's great to\nallow both parties to talk a bit about\nthemselves when having a conversation\nand if you really want someone to like\nyou the key may just be to Simply listen\nto them let them talk about themselves\nfor a while too Harvard researchers\ndiscovered that taking the time to talk\nabout yourself can have its Rewards\nin one of the five studies subjects sat\nin an fmri machine and had to respond to\nquestions about either their own\nopinions on a subject or another's\nregions of the brain associated with\nreward and motivation were most active\nwhen talking about their own thoughts on\na subject as opposed to others in fact\nthe need to talk about ourselves is so\nstrong that in another study conducted\nby Harvard researchers some subjects\neven declined money to talk about\nthemselves more as the research article\nStates self-disclosure was strongly\nassociated with increased activation in\nbrain regions that formed the mesolympic\ndopamine System including the nucleus\naccumbens and ventral tegmental area\nmoreover individuals were willing to\nforego money to disclose about the self\ndon't be afraid to share your opinions\nand thoughts but also remember to listen\nto theirs as well they may just like you\nfor it and you may just hear something\nabout them that you like so do you do\nany of these things will you work on\nyour listening skills be less\nembarrassed when you make a small\nblender feel free to share with us your\nthoughts in the comments down below if\nyou
