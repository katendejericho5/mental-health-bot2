    "transcript": "without sex we would be dangerously\ninvulnerable we might believe we were\nnot ridiculous we wouldn't know\nrejection and humiliation so intimately\nthis is what Elaine to bottom author of\nhow to think more about sex has to say\nabout the lack of this Universal love\nlanguage\nSexes or at least should be the sign of\nan unconditional acceptance that we feel\ntowards our partner and then our partner\nfeels towards us\nit is through sex that two people send\neach other those comforting hidden\nmessages\nI think you're beautiful\nI desire you I love you nobody even\nstill many times our deepest desires go\nignored it may feel shameful and\nhumiliating to admit that we sometimes\nfeel dirty for wanting more sex but\nmaking love is the fundamental drive\nthat makes us human without sex for most\nof us our relationship starts to suffer\nand we start suffering from the inside\nas well what does it feel like to be in\na sexless relationship\nhere are four signs you might be sex\nstarved number one\nhave you been feeling uncomfortable in\nyour own skin lately you're waiting and\nwaiting for your partner to send a\npassionate look your way but the moment\nnever comes as a result you may start\nnoticing little imperfections on your\nbody and feel undesirable or\nunattractive a 2019 study published in\nthe Journal of women's health found that\nbody image can actually impact sexual\nsatisfaction\nfeeling uncomfortable in your body could\nmake you feel uncomfortable while having\nsex too the study shows that feeling\nattractive is an important aspect of\nsexual activity\nsex should make you feel like your\npartner loves and enjoys your body\nit's comforting to be able to be\nyourself in front of someone exactly as\nyou are\nso when you haven't been touched for a\nlong time it's natural you start\nquestioning your attractiveness number\ntwo seeing red\naccording to a study published in the\nJournal of sex research people who want\nto have more sex but can't for some\nreason often report feelings of anger\nand frustration\ndo you feel like the lack of sex is\nmaking you a bit angry\nmaybe you get irrationally frustrated\nover the tiniest things a messy kitchen\nor the trash waiting to be taken out may\nbecome horrible and unforgivable\nmistakes\nyour partner might look you bewildered\nand wonder what's going on but your\nanger didn't come overnight\nit's possible that negative feelings\nthat come with rejection have been\nbuilding up inside you when that happens\nyou may not know how to get rid of all\nthose intense emotions but if you start\nto lose your temper more often it could\nturn your partner off even more\nforeign\nrunning away a research study published\nin 2011 in Journal of sex and marital\ntherapy showed that men and women who\nwere dissatisfied with their frequency\nof sex were also more likely to express\noverall lower relationship satisfaction\nand when they became dissatisfied with\ntheir relationship they might start\nwithdrawing from their partner\ncompletely have you noticed you're\nspending less and less time with your\npartner\ndo you feel lonely even when you're\nright next to them\nit's possible to lose interest in what\nyour loved one has to say or spending\ntime with them unfortunately for some\npeople this withdrawal can create even\nmore problems they might become so\ndisinterested in their partner that they\ndon't even wish to have sex with them\nanymore\nand number four\nbidden fantasies\nas the end result sometimes the lack of\nsex can bring us into the Embrace of\nanother person whether it's physically\nor in our minds we may long for someone\nelse's touch that's not because we don't\nlove our partner but because we can't\nkeep up with the unfulfilled desires the\nreason for this could have something to\ndo with our brain chemistry professor Dr\nRenee hurleman from the Bond University\nMedical Center says that an important\nrole in partner bonding is played by the\nhormone oxytocin oxytocin is commonly\nknown as the love hormone then a study\npublished in journal proceedings of the\nNational Academy of Sciences showed that\nhigher levels of oxytocin can actually\nincrease the need for monogamy so when\nwe lack the love hormone that comes from\nsex and bonding we might fantasize about\nother people wondering how it might be\nif we were single and available\ndo you sometimes imagine being with\nsomeone else\nfor those who do this can be hard to\nadmit even to ourselves it only\nincreases the guilt and shame that we\nfeel already and makes us feel like\nwe're terrible\nbut no matter how bad you might feel\nit's important to remember to be gentle\nwith yourself what you feel is a part of\nBeing Human\nwhy sex is good as we said before sex is\na love language and apart from building\na connection with your loved one it also\nplays a role in your physical and\nemotional health\nStudies have supported this Theory\nshowing that sex improves heart health\nsoothes headaches acts as a form of\nexercise and boosts immune function but\nno matter how deprived you may feel it's\nimportant to note that your partner's\nperspective is important too\njust as you shouldn't be shamed for\nwanting more sex they shouldn't be\nshamed for wanting less even if a couple\nis dating or married Partners shouldn't\nfeel like they have an obligation to\nhave sex if they don't want to the best\nthing you could do is ask them openly is\nthere something wrong and if the problem\nis a bit deeper visiting a sex therapist\nor a couple's therapist might be what\nimproves your relationship and connects\nyour bodies again\ndo you relate to any of these signs this\nvideo explains the perspectives of\npeople with a higher sex drive but if\nyou're actually the one who doesn't feel\nlike having sex check out this video to\nsee if you're sexually repressed\nforeign"
