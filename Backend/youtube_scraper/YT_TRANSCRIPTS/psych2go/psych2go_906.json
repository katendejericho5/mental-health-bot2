hour or so\nthere's nothing wrong with communicating\nyour whereabouts by any means but it can\nbecome super tiresome if you're always\nbeing asked on a repetitive Loop it's\nimportant to have your own time away\nfrom your partner even when things are\ngoing well if both parties don't have\ntheir own space in the relationship\nthat's not healthy one of you if not\nboth may feel a loss of identity even if\nyou live together your partner still\nneeds to respect your space and vice\nversa so far do any of these behaviors\nsound familiar to you if so what do you\nplan to do next comment

and\nthey're not that can be a problem they\nexpect you to do everything for them\nwithout being thoughtful of your needs\nthey don't own up to their mistakes and\nthey get defensive pretty quickly in\ntimes of Crisis they don't show you any\nsupport or even offer a shoulder to cry\non they distance themselves to avoid you\nand the situation\nnumber four gaslighting\nare you unsure if they're manipulating\nyou gaslighting is to manipulate a\nperson by psychological means into\nquestioning their own sanity they make\nyou feel shame and guilt over how you\nsupposedly acted particularly when no\none else does gaslighting is very subtle\nand can easily warp a person's sense of\nself they make you question your own\njudgment the more you hear hurtful\nthings about yourself especially coming\nfrom someone you love the more you begin\nto believe them\nit's one of the worst and most toxic\nthings someone can do\nnumber five constant lying does your\npartner lie do you often find them in\nthe middle of a lie honesty is key in\nany relationship the stepping stone to\ntrust\nwhen your partner is a compulsive liar\nthey may lie so often that they can't\neven keep their story straight anymore\nthat's totally unfair to you it's not a\nhealthy environment for you to be in\nsometimes people stay in unhealthy\nrelationships because they believe that\nthey can and will get better while\nsometimes that can be true most of the\ntime though if you are dating someone\nwho lies a lot chances are they always\nwill number six Super flakiness are they\nalways running late for your movie dates\ndo they apologize to you or just brush\nit off like it's no big deal to be fair\npeople can sometimes be late it does\nhappen\nevents can transpire and that's totally\nout of your control\nbut it is also necessary to make time\nfor those that they care about this\nincludes keeping you in the loop if your\npartner has to cancel appearing at an\nevent that you are both going to they\nshould let you know as soon as possible\nor are you waiting in agony for two or\nthree hours with no reply\nit's normal for people to not respond\nright away but they should get back to\nyou within a respectable amount of time\nnumber seven false accusations\ndisagreements and the occasional fight\nin a relationship can be healthy but if\nthey're in the habit of accusing you of\nthings that you can never even imagine\nthis can be a major red flag accusations\nsuch as questioning your loyalty all the\ntime can be utterly Soul destroying\noftentimes those who are guilty of\nsomething they know is wrong will\nproject it onto someone else it's always\na good idea to guard against such\nBehavior the most important thing to\nremember is that you need to stay true\nto yourself even if
