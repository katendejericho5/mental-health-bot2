    "transcript": "hey sector goers have you ever stopped\nto think whether what you're feeling in\nyour relationship is genuine\nperhaps you're thinking in a way that\nhas you questioning your true feelings\nfor your significant other this video\ndiscusses the differences between a\ncodependent relationship and authentic\nlove to give an insight into what people\nmay experience but if you are having\ncodependent thoughts that doesn't mean\nyou aren't genuinely in love with\nanother person\nnumber one choice\nwhat codependent may sound like\nI need you and I know you need me I\ncan't live without you and I know that\nyou can't live without me when authentic\nlove may sound like\nchoose to be in a relationship with you\nchoose to be with me I enjoy being in\nyour company and appreciate spending\ntime with you however I am also happy\nhaving my alone time I do not rely on\nyou alone to make me happy\nin a codependent relationship there has\nto exist a level of dependency either\nfrom one person or both parties involved\nmaking somebody else feel responsible\nfor your happiness and your well-being\nis a form of emotional manipulation\nchoice is an important factor in any\nrelationship when individuals feel that\nthey are making a choice in any\nrelationship this allows an individual\nto feel that they have a sense of\ncontrol\nwhen people don't feel like they have a\nchoice this can cause pressure and\nindividuals may feel trapped or that\nthey cannot actively be in control of\nwhat is happening in their relationships\npeople should be in relationships with\neach other because they want to and not\nbecause they feel that they need to\nnumber two dependent what codependent\nmay sound like I need you to feel okay\notherwise I will not be okay what\nauthentic love may sound like you are\nyour own person and are allowed to\nexperience feelings without judgment\nfrom me people's feelings should not be\ndependent on others and this could come\nacross as emotional manipulation because\npeople should be free to experience\ntheir own emotions and feelings without\nbeing made to feel that their mood or\nhow their feeling is based on how their\npartner feels or that they should be\nokay in order for their partner to be as\nwell when your identity is based solely\non people pleasing and you feel\nresponsible for everyone's well-being\nyou might find yourself reacting to\nsituations rather than by your own\nchoice\nnumber three communication what\ncodependency may sound like\nyou should know what I need if I have to\nexplain it to you then you clearly don't\nlisten to me or understand me properly\nwhat an authentic love may sound like\nI will communicate my needs to you\nopenly and\nnot just expect you to know what I need\na codependent mindset makes it hard to\ncommunicate effectively as people are\noften unaware of their own wants and\nneeds and when people are aware they may\nbe reluctant to express them dishonesty\ncan also develop as a habit when people\nare more interested in maintaining a\nsense of control than actually\ncommunicating in order for any\nrelationship to be successful\nindividuals must learn to communicate\nhonestly and effectively number four\nwhat codependency may sound like if you\ndo not support me I will guilt-trip you\nso you understand that I am not happy\nwhat authentic love may sound like\nI will ask for support from you and\nothers when I need it I will not take my\nanger out on you if you can't support me\nin the way that I need it at the time\nstress can play a huge factor in any\nrelationship especially when there are\ncommunication and Boundary issues\ncodependent Partners may feel insecure\nabout being abandoned being alone and\nnot being supported by their partner\nresult they may end up taking their\nfrustration out on their partners and\nblaming them unnecessarily which can\ncause relationship stress\nnumber five boundaries\nwhat codependency may sound like I will\nblame you and shame you for not doing\nwhat I want you to do\nwhat authentic love may sound like I\nrespect your boundaries and do my best\nto discuss them with you if I overstep\nthem in the same way I will inform you\nabout my boundaries and communicate how\nI want to be treated and spoken to\npeople in both roles in a codependent\nrelationship tend to have problems\nrecognizing respecting and reinforcing\nboundaries having boundaries is about\nhaving respect for each other and\nrecognizing that individuals are not\nresponsible for other people's happiness\nsetting and maintaining boundaries is an\nimportant skill that cannot be ignored\nin any relationship\nnumber six control what codependency may\nsound like\nyou would do what I asked if you truly\nloved me what authentic love may sound\nlike\nI understand that there will be times\nwhen we disagree on things but that does\nnot dictate whether you love me or not\nwe will communicate those differences\nopenly and resolve any differences with\nlove and respect typically neither\nperson in a codependent relationship has\nvery good self-esteem which will often\ninvolve seeking approval or validation\nfrom others and wanting to have a sense\nof purpose\nthese factors are not met this can lead\nto further insecurity controlling\nbehavior and emotional manipulation and\nnumber seven\nworth what codependency may sound like I\nneed to feel wanted and needed by you I\ndon't feel valued by you if you don't\nshow me that\nwhat authentic love may sound like\nI am valued and worthy without needing\napproval from others my role is to be a\nsupportive partner not a therapist or to\ntry and fix other people's problems\none of the major signs of codependency\nis either feeling a sense of\nresponsibility towards others to take\ncare of them or expecting others to take\ncare of us an example of this may stem\nfrom childhood when the caretaker learns\nthere may be negative consequences for\nfailing to take care of a parent's needs\nthis fear of something bad happening\ncauses people to take care of others\nrather than it being out of genuine\naffection which may indicate\ncodependency\ncan you relate to any of these signs let\nus know in the comments below and share\nthis video with others who might benefit\nas always the references and studies\nused are in the description below until\nnext time friends take care and thanks\nfor watching\n[Music]"
