    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever wondered\nwhat your flirting style says about you?\nOr maybe how your personality\naffects how you flirt?\nWell, researchers Hall,\nCarter, Cody, and Albright\nwanted to assess\nhow people communicated their\nromantic or sexual interest\nto a potential partner\nin a 2010 research study.\nThey had participants\nanswer a questionnaire,\nand gathered information\non the subject's personalities as well,\ncomparing the information.\nHere are the results of\nthe five flirting styles\nand how they could relate\nto one's personality.\nWhich flirting style do you have?\nNumber one, playful.\nAre you a playful flirt?\nThose who often playfully flirt\nsee it as something that's fun.\nThey wanna joke and tease\ntheir potential partner.\nExtroverts are more\nlikely to playfully flirt.\nResearchers also found\nthat those who often only playfully flirt\nwere less agreeable\nand less conscientious.\nDr. Jeremy Nicholson,\na doctor of social personality psychology,\nexplains in his \"Psychology Today\" article\nthat playful flirts\ntend to have a don't\ncare and all or nothing\ntype of approach to dating.\nTherefore, they first\nneed to be able to cope\nwith interpersonal rejection,\nwhich will inevitably result\nfrom their more playful\nand outrageous behaviors.\nNumber two, sincere.\nWhat if you like to create an\nemotional bond with someone\nbefore testing out your flirting skills?\nAs a sincere flirt,\nyou like to make your potential partner\nfeel comfortable first\nbefore you make your move.\nYou show sincere interest\nand value a deeper connection with them.\nWomen were found to have scored higher\nin this type of flirting.\nMen did use this flirting style as well.\nIf you're very agreeable\nand conscientious,\nyou'll likely use this\nflirting style more.\nExtroverts also use this style\nas well as playful flirting.\nIn the 2010 study,\ndating success was found\nthrough sincere, playful and\nphysical flirting styles.\nNicholson suggests that sincere flirts\ncan become more successful\nby focusing on building\na positive personality\nand developing their uniquely\nattractive traits and skills.\nHe also recommends making good eye contact\nand practicing reading\nothers' body language.\nNumber three, traditional.\nAre you a traditional flirt?\nTraditional flirts often stick\nto gender specific roles.\nPerhaps you're at a party,\nthis could be the woman\nshowing someone she likes them\nby showing interest\nthrough flirty eye\ncontact across the room.\nThe man would then often\nmake the first move\nby talking to her.\nThe study found that introverts\noften flirted this way.\nThey also found men who\nflirted traditionally\noften already knew their potential partner\nbefore flirting this way.\nThose who flirt this way are\noften looking for commitment.\nThose who use this style\noften have a hard time getting dates\nand creating many deep relationships.\nAlthough some benefited\nfrom taking things slow\nin their relationships\nand letting them form over time.\nNumber four, physical.\nDo you flirt by subtly touching others\nand displaying open body language?\nThis type of flirting show sexuality\nand interest through non-verbal behaviors.\nMany people were found\nto often have great chemistry\nand emotional connection\nwhen they flirt this way.\nRelationships are often developed\nfaster this way as well.\nExtroverts often use this flirting style\nand were found in the study\nto be moderately agreeable\nand conscientious.\nNicholson's suggestion for this\ntype of flirting to succeed,\nhe suggests that learning\nto be confident and curious\nrather than anxious\ncan assist the physical flirt\nin creating a smooth and\npassionate interaction.\nAnd number five, polite.\nAre you more polite when\nyou approach your crush?\nPolite flirts are often moral\nand cautious in their flirting\nto avoid embarrassing themselves\nor out of fear of rejection.\nThey have great manners\nand approach, as the\nname suggests, politely.\nThey're interested in commitment,\nso they often clearly share\nwhat they want in a\npartner when appropriate.\nPolite flirts are often introverts.\nThey also often have a hard time\ngetting dates with potential partners,\nbut the few relationships\nthey have are very deep,\nemotional and meaningful to them.\nSo how do you flirt
