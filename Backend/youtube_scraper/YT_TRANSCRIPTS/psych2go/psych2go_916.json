body he called those fluids\nhumors\nblood yellow bile black bile and phlegm\na few centuries later a fellow physician\nnamed galen was intrigued by hippocrates\nideas\nso he built up on it and proposed the\nfirst categorization of human behavior\nand temperament he believed the four\nfluids affected the person's behavior\ncreating four types of temperament\ncholeric melancholic sanguine
