    "transcript": "do you feel like bad days are now your\nnew normal\ntruth is bad days are often caused by\nour own built up bad habits or an\nunderlying maybe unconscious belief that\nif it starts bad it's going to just get\nworse that means you usually have the\npower to not have a bad day it's all\nabout setting the stage for it to happen\nhere are some quick tips that are good\nhabits to cultivate you may even find\nthat some bad habits are only bad\nbecause of the way they've been handled\nso far so here are a few habits to help\nyou make your day better\nnumber one remembering to be grateful\nthis isn't momentarily saying okay this\nin my life is good that my life is good\nit's a brain exercise\na brain exercise\nyeah you're training your brain to see\nthe good and the beauty of life as part\nof its Norm instead of living in a\nblanket of problems and negativity\nthe when you do this is up to you doing\nit at the start of your day means you\nset the day up for a positive outlook\ndoing it before bed helps to unload\nheaviness and exhaustive stress thoughts\nnumber two change your scenery buy a\nplane ticket not necessarily walk in the\nparkworks too visiting a new place once\nin a while can help stimulate your mind\ngiving you that recharge so you can\ncontinue doing work in a healthy\nheadspace number three do one thing at a\ntime\nwe know it sounds more efficient if you\ncan do everything all at once\nunfortunately human cloning isn't a\nthing because that's the only way all at\nonce would really work partially doing a\nwhole bunch of little things will leave\nyou with a whole bunch of Unfinished\nthings that are hastily wrapped up\nbecause you're now overwhelmed\nyou're a quality person and when you do\none thing at a time that quality shines\nthrough if it's a massive project break\nit up into itty-bitty part that you\ncomplete one at a time in entirety each\nsmall completion is a win 50 wins and\nequality result versus one sort of win\nwith a mediocre result which one sounds\nbetter\nnumber four laugh laughter is as they\nsay the best medicine it activates the\nrelease of some feel-good hormones and\nspreads joy to others it helps break\ntension and lighten negative feelings\nyour day is going to be better if you\nand the people in your life are happier\nnumber five help someone this one has a\ndouble positive firstly helping others\nis the way humans usually function\nhappiest we feel accomplished useful\neven valuable helping someone exercises\nour empathy and compassion allowing us\nto expand our perspective and\nsubsequently allowing us to like\nourselves more secondly in helping\nanother person you're helping to problem\nsolve and this in turn could give you\nthe knowledge and inspiration on how to\ndeal with an issue in your own life\nnumber six prepare the night before\nIf we're honest with ourselves sometimes\nthat bad day happens because we didn't\nprep the night before we know when it's\nlate and you just want to sleep it's\neasy to convince yourself\nI can totally quickly do that thing in\nthe morning\nand we know how that works out\nmorning arrives you're half asleep brain\nand body won't do the thing and now\nyou're stressed frazzled and feeling\ninsecure so just give an honest little\nrebuttal to the voice that's telling you\nI can do this in the morning and take at\nleast a few minutes to do some prep for\nthe next day when you wake up and it's\nall ready to go you'll already be doing\ngratitude practice number seven hype\nyourself up yes we're telling you to buy\ninto your own hype it may not work for\neveryone but it's worth a try before a\nbig event or performance even going to a\ngathering you're nervous about you can\nbuy into your own hype for just that\namount of time that booster shot of\nextra self-belief even though temporary\ncould be what makes the big deal event\ngo that much smoother which in turn can\nmake the day the week your life that\nmuch better\nsaying or writing down affirmations\nevery day can help with this and\ngradually with increased self-belief\nconfidence will naturally flow number\neight relaxation yep we said it relax\nokay we know that sounds super vague I\ndon't know how to relax you say not to\nworry we're not gonna leave you hanging\nto practice relaxing as odd as that\nsounds create a relax and de-stress\nroutine this can be as simple as reading\na good book taking a warm bath and\nlistening to calming music\nthis will allow you to focus on each\nstep and really do the relaxing\ndetaching and unwinding\nthis means too that the hamster wheel of\nworry is no longer interrupting your\nsleep and better sleep means better mood\nnumber nine take your time we all want\nto do things quickly to get to the next\nthing and then to the next but we forget\nthat sometimes the best thing you can do\nis take your time to enjoy what you're\ndoing at the moment\ntaking your time ensures that you do a\ngood job on your project that you focus\non it and that you learn how to be in\nthe present moment bonus this is a sort\nof gratitude practice allowing you to\nget the best out of every second and be\npresent in the moment although the media\nwould like to have us believe that if we\nbuy that product Our Lives will be\nbetter in truth it's the little things\nthat only we can do for ourselves that\nmake the biggest difference\nthese dips are by no means exhaustive\nbut we hope we've given you an idea of\nthings to try or maybe inspired you to\nlook up other happy habits to learn\nwhich of these happy habits have you\ntried or have worked for you any other\nhabits you'd like to suggest please feel\nfree to comment discuss and spread the\njoy we also strongly believe clicking\nthe like button will contribute to a\nbetter day thanks for watching and see\nyou soon"
