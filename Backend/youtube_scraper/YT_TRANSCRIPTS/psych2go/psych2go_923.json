    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nWelcome back to our channel.\nHave you ever wondered\nif someone was into you\nbut we're trying to hide\ntheir feelings for you?\nI mean, maybe you've\nhad a crush on someone\nand didn't want them to know.\nHow do you know if someone\nis doing the same to you?\nDoes someone have a crush on you?\nWell, here are seven signs\nsomeone is into you, but\ntried not to show it.\nNumber one,\nthey'll do things you like\nto be around you more.\nWhen we like someone,\nwe generally wanna be around them more\naccording to dating psychologist\nMadeleine Mason Roantree.\nThe reward system in our brains\ncan increase our motivation\nto spend more time with whoever we like.\nIf we enjoy being around them,\nwhy wouldn't we wanna\nhang out with them more?\nShe explains that you may just start to\ncrave their presence.\nThey may even start to take up hobbies\nor enroll in activities\nthat you're a part of\nto be closer to you.\nEven if they weren't\ninitially into the hobby\nor activity itself\nbefore, Roantree explains.\nIt also gives you something\nelse you can talk to them about.\nAnd perhaps it's a way to entice\nthem to get closer to you.\nTime to enter the chess club.\nYou can't help it.\nNot only does your crush like chess,\nbut you've been watching too\nmuch of the \"Queen's Gambit\"\non Netflix.\nNumber two, their pupils dilate.\nTrying to decide if someone likes you?\nThere's a lot that comes into play,\nbut try looking into their eyes\nto see if their pupils dilate\naccording to body language\nexpert Patti Wood,\nauthor of \"Success Signals\na Guide to Reading Body Language.\"\nDilation is a brain response that occurs\nwhen you like and are\nattracted to something.\nSo, next time you're\nhanging out with someone\nand you see their pupils dilate,\nask yourself this: Is the lighting dim?\nOr are they just really happy to see me?\nNumber three, they somehow\nknow things about you\nthat you've never told them.\nSo you've noticed your lab partner\nknows that you really like chess,\nbut you've never told them.\nOkay. Well, are you\nfriends on social media?\nOkay, that makes sense.\nBut you posted a photo\nof you playing chess\nbefore you followed each other,\nactually months and months ago.\nWell, they've likely scrolled\nback to all your old posts.\nWhy, you may ask?\n'Cause they like you,\nor they just really wanna be your friend.\nBut, if you hear from your friends\nthat they often ask about you,\nthat's a key sign they may\nsecretly like you as well.\nNumber four, you catch\nthem staring at you.\nHappen to catch a particular someone\nalways staring your way\nduring class or at work?\nThis is a classic sign that\nthey may be attracted to you.\nDid you often get caught\nstaring at your crush?\nIt's common to want to turn your gaze\ntowards who you find attractive.\nSo if you catch someone doing this often,\nlooking at you, then they\nmay just find you attractive.\nIf they turn away, they're\nlikely trying not to show it.\nNumber six, they try to find\nout your relationship status.\nAh, you notice your crush\ncasually asking about\nyour significant other.\nBut you don't have one, or maybe you do.\nIf someone does this, try\nto see how they react.\nIt may be subtle\nif they're trying to hide\ntheir feelings for you.\nBut if they look disappointed\nwhen you say you are in a relationship,\nthey may just like you.\nAnd if you're single\nand they can't help but hide a grin,\nthis is a big sign they\nmay be attracted to you.\nNumber seven, they seem\nnervous around you.\nSo, you've noticed a few of\nthe signs in someone you know.\nBut then you also notice\nthey always seem nervous around you too.\nSometimes, when we like someone,\nwe can become a bit nervous.\nStammering, breaking out in sweats\nand clammy hands may just be signs\nthey like you so much that\nyou make them nervous.\nAttraction can even make\nus a bit dumb sometimes.\nResearch has found that sexual arousal\nshuts off parts of the\nprefrontal cortex of the brain.\nThis region of the brain is responsible\nfor critical thinking, rational behavior\nand self-awareness.\nNext time you're around\nthem, pay attention.\nDo they always break out in a sweat?\nThey can't speak as\neloquently as they usually do?\nPerhaps they secretly have a crush on you.\nAnd if they have most of the signs,\nthey're most likely very into you.\nSo, do you notice someone\ndisplaying these signs\ntowards you?\nWho do you think likes you,\nyour lab partner, your friend?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nIf you enjoyed this video\ndon't forget to click the like button\nand share it with a friend.\nSubscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification bell icon\nfor more content like this.\nAnd, as always, thanks\nso much for watching.\nSee you next time."
