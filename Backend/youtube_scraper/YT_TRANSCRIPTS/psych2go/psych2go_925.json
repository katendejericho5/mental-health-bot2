    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Have you ever met someone\nwho seemed very empathetic\nbut all their assumptions\nabout what you were feeling\nwere wrong?\nPerhaps you even come away\nfeeling even more misunderstood.\nIf so, you may have met a fake empath\ninstead of a genuine one.\nThey may tell you things\nyou don't relate to\nor point out qualities\nthat are inaccurate.\nIf you've had these experiences,\nhere are five signs of a fake empath.\nNumber one.\nThey want to diagnose you.\nHave you ever tried opening\nup to someone close to you\nonly to end up feeling like\nyour problems got worse?\nFake empaths will tell\nyou how you're feeling\nand why you're feeling this way\ninstead of simply trying to\nunderstand and be there for you.\nThey'll try to analyze and diagnose,\nwhich may only make you\nfeel worse than before.\nIn contrast,\ngenuine empaths will take\nthe time to hear you out,\ntry to understand your situation,\nand provide you with the\ncomfort and support you need.\nNumber two.\nThey can't stand being wrong.\nFake empaths cannot stand being corrected\nwhen they make a wrong\nassumption about you.\nThis stems from the belief\nthat they have a special\nability to understand others,\nthat their assumptions are\nalways accurate and right.\nSo telling them that they\nwere wrong or saying no\nmight end up shattering their ego\nand cause them to become very defensive.\nThey may even start telling\nyou that you're wrong\nabout your own feelings.\nGenuine empaths on the other hand\nwill be more likely to understand\nthat there's always room for error\nand be remorseful and apologetic\nwhen their assumptions are wrong.\nNumber three.\nThey will point out\nyour negative feelings.\nFake empaths wanna make you feel\nlike they know and understand\nexactly what you feel.\nSo they may go out of their\nway to pinpoint emotions\nyou'd rather keep to yourself.\nThis may mean pointing out\nand letting everyone know\nwhen you're upset, in grief, or in pain.\nIn this way they can show\nothers their special ability\nto feel what others are feeling.\nAlthough without much consideration\nto how it may end up hurting that person.\nNumber four.\nThey want everyone to\nknow that they're empaths.\nAre they always telling people\nhow accurate their abilities are?\nAnother sign of a fake empath\nis if they're always announcing\nit to everyone everywhere.\nThis can mean seizing every opportunity\nto put the spotlight on them.\nIn comparison,\nempaths don't require or desire\nthe attention and concern\nthat comes with disclosing their ability.\nAfter all,\nif you say you can sense\nother people's emotions\nyou'll probably get a lot\nof questions about it.\nAnd whilst a genuine empath\nmay not appreciate these questions,\na fake one would love the attention.\nNumber five.\nThey blame emotional influence.\nTrue empaths can feel and understand\nthe emotional experiences\nof the people around them\nwhich can sometimes be exhausting\nand impact their own emotions.\nHowever, even if it can\naffect how they feel,\nthey won't allow it to\nhave a detrimental impact\non those around them.\nThis may mean\nremoving themselves from\na situation for some time\nto avoid upsetting their family or friends\nif their feelings become too powerful.\nIn stark contrast,\nfake empaths will use this as a reason\nto justify their bad moods\nand unpleasant behavior.\nSo do you think you've met a fake empath?\nLet us know in the comments below.\nAnd if you found this video helpful\nbe sure to like, subscribe,\nand share this video\nwith those who may benefit from it.\nAnd don't forget to hit\nthe notification bell icon\nto get notified whenever\nPsych2Go posts a new video.\nThe references and\nstudies used in this video\nare added in the description below.\nThanks so much for watching\nand see you in our next video."
