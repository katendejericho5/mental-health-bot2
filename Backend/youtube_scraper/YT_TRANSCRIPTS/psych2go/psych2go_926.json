    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers.\nDo you have a crush you wanna ask out?\nAre you pretty new\nto asking someone out on a date?\nWhere do you begin?\nWell, there are a few ways\nyou can approach asking your crush out.\nWe're gonna break down a\nfew ways on how you can.\nSo here are a few tips\non how to ask your crush out.\nNumber one, ask them\nto a particular event.\nOne way to ease into\nthat important question\nyou wanna ask your crush\nis to ask them out to a particular event.\nThat possible awkward\nsilence may be shortened\nif you mention the event\nyou wanna take them to shortly before.\nLet's say you have tickets to a concert.\nYou might ask them what\nkinda music they like.\nThen you may bring up\nthe specific musician\nwhose concert you wanna go to.\nIf they mention they like\nthe musician or band,\nthen you can hypothetically say,\n\"Me too, I love them.\nI was gonna go to their concert this week\nand have another ticket.\nDo you wanna go with me?\"\nThen, they'll hopefully have two reasons\nto say yes to your request.\nJust make sure to bring up\nthat it's a date later on\nbefore the concert, so they know.\nNumber two, compliment them first.\nInstead of approaching\nsomeone you find attractive\nand immediately jumping into the,\n\"Will you go out with me?\"\ncatch their eye with a smile.\nYou want them to know\nyou've been looking at them,\nas long as it's not creepy.\nSo smile and make a good\namount of eye contact.\nI wouldn't aim for staring,\nbut let them know you're saying\na friendly hi to them with your eyes.\nThen approach them with a compliment.\nLet them know why you like them.\nIf you've been talking for a while,\nmention how you appreciate\ntheir passion for what they do,\ntheir talent, their personality,\nor something else.\nCompliment their outfit\nor a feature you like,\nthen ask them out on a date.\nGood ol' Sigh may say something like,\n\"I really like your smile.\"\nThen they would reply with perhaps a,\n\"Oh, thanks.\"\nAnd Sigh would reply with,\n\"Would you wanna go on a\ndate with me sometime?\"\nIt's a simple approach.\nAnd either they'll say yes or no.\nMuster up that courage\nand confidence and simply ask,\nyou don't wanna at not asking them at all.\nNumber three, get to know them better\nor befriend them first.\nAre you friends with your crush?\nThis may make it easier to ask them out,\nor more difficult.\nSituations vary.\nBut if you hardly know your crush\nbut often see them,\ntry to befriend them a bit first.\nThat way, they get a\nchance to get to know you\nand perhaps see what makes you\nattractive and unique.\nIf you're afraid of the friend zone,\nsimply try to get to know them\na bit first before asking.\nTry to have a few moments\nand conversations with them\nthat are more than small talk.\nThis way, they'll get more\ncomfortable around you\nand may find that they\nwanna hang around you more,\nperhaps on a date.\nNumber four, give them hints\nthat you you like them\nfirst with flirting.\nHave you ever felt the awkward silence\nafter asking someone something\nthey didn't expect?\nOr maybe you've heard rumors about it.\nWell, to avoid this,\ngive your crush hints that you like them\nso they're not completely\ncaught off guard.\nTry a bit of flirting,\ngood eye contact, a few compliments.\nMaybe try the classic,\nlook, don't look, look.\nNope, I have no idea\nwhat I'm talking about?\nYou simply look their way,\nthey look back, you give a smile\nand then look away, still smiling.\nThis often happens naturally\nbut with much more panic.\nInstead, embrace that flirty smile\nand then look away.\nYou're giving them a quick hint\nthat you like them.\nNow, time to approach\nthem with a compliment\nand then ask them out.\nNumber five, talk about something\nyou both have in common,\nthen mention how you wanna continue\nthe conversation somewhere after.\nIf you're still a bit fearful\nof that transition into asking them out,\nthis method may help.\nYou can start up a conversation with them,\npreferably a good one,\nand then mention how you should both\ncontinue the conversation\nafter work or school,\nat this nice coffee\nshop or diner you love.\nThis way, you can ease into the question\nor statement a bit easier.\nThey'll hopefully wanna\ncontinue the conversation\nand at the nice location\nyou mentioned too.\nIf they say yes, give\nthem the address and time\nor tell them you'll meet them somewhere\nso you can walk or drive\nto the place together\nif they're comfortable with that.\nNumber six, ask them out\nwhen they're preferably\nalone and in-person\nso things are more comfortable\nand so you're not interrupted\nduring your conversation.\nTry asking out your\ncrush when they're alone\nor have a moment away\nfrom their friends or coworkers.\nThis will give you both some privacy\nand make responding\nand exchanging information a lot easier.\nIt's also a good idea to\nask them out in-person,\nas it can show you care about them\nand are confident in asking them out.\nIt will also give them a chance\nto see your expression,\nhow much you like them,\nand give you a chance\nto see how they react.\nIf you can't seem to find\na moment alone with them\nbut have their number\nor follow them on social media,\na message or text works\nalmost just as well.\nAnd number seven, find your courage\nand stay true to your initial feelings.\nAsking someone out can take\na good amount of courage sometimes,\nespecially if you're not used to it.\nBut finding your courage\nand making the that step\nto ask your crush out can be worth it.\nAn important part of asking anyone out\nis also to stay true to yourself\nand your feelings.\nDon't be afraid to smile\nif you feel like it\nand show them that you're happy.\nYou're holding onto your confidence\nand feelings by doing this.\nYou know how you feel, you like them.\nAnd if they say no to your request\nand let you know that\nthey're not interested\nin you romantically,\nthen respectfully accept this\nand try not to take back your offer,\ndeny your feelings or appear as if\nyou don't care at all.\nFor a moment, in a way,\nyou did care about them.\nSo you should respect their feelings\nand decisions and respect\nhow you feel as well.\nYou could tell them, \"No problem,\"\nand smile at the fact\nthat you had the courage\nand confidence to ask.\nThen you can try your best to move on.\nAs they say, there are\nplenty of fish in the sea\nand people's lives are often filled\nwith many crushes.\nPerhaps there's someone out there\ncrushing on you.\nSo, how will you ask your crush out?\nIf you don't, will you regret it?\nWe believe in you.\nFeel free to comment your idea\non how you wanna ask your crush out\nin the
