    "transcript": "foreign\nhave you ever wondered what is\nborderline personality disorder what is\nthe process of getting treatment like\nand what are some possible coping\nstrategies well that's today's topic for\nour ask and expert series an interview\nSeries where we chat about mental health\ntopics with experts so think clinicians\nor those with lived expertise\nI'm Monica and I study medicine I'm\nreally Keen to make Psychiatry\naccessible for everyone so I really like\nhosting these bi-weekly sessions where\nwe sit down with experts or those with\nlived expertise to really chat about any\nmental health topics that you might be\ninterested in so if you yourself would\nlike to be featured or if you have any\nfeedback or questions then please\nconsider to check out the contact\ndescription box below\nand with that I would love to introduce\nyou to our wonderful guest today Dr Ali\nwelcome\nhi it's like to go what's up what's up\nMonica how's it going I'm so happy to\nget to chat with you today how are you\nI am good I am good I am well\ncaffeinated I feel uh I feel ready\nexcited\num yeah things are good good so let's\njust jump right in I think it'd be great\nfor us um all just to get to learn a bit\nabout you and the kind of work that you\nmight do\nyeah well um clinical psychologist by\ntraining my area of focus has been\nanxiety disorders and anxiety Related\nDisorders so uh social anxiety Panic OCD\nall that sort of stuff in grad school I\nstudied hair pulling disorders skin\npicking disorder and those types of body\nfocus repetitive behavior problems and\nthen on my post-doc is when I started\ndoing a lot of work with borderline\npersonality disorder and I got trained\nin a treatment where I'm sure we're\ngoing to talk about which is dialectical\nbehavior therapy and I just really\num this became one of my favorite things\nto work with for a wide variety of\nreasons so that's me\num I did that for a long time at\nColumbia University I was an assistant\nprofessor there and I've been kind of\nworking much more in the media space for\nthe past few years I've got a YouTube\nchannel the psych show where I try to\nmake psychology fun and easy to\nunderstand so we definitely share that\nmission Monica not only with yourself\nbut what's like to go in the whole\nCommunity here and I just want\num I want to make this knowledge this\ninformation everything I have learned\nthrough my professional work my personal\nlife when it comes to mental health I\nwant to make this stuff really fun\nreally easy to understand I want to\nshare it with everyone because mental\nhealth information can be so hard to\naccess and understand and all that sort\nof stuff and I think it should be\nit should be freely readily easily\navailable so that's who I am\nthank you so much for sharing I\nabsolutely agree I feel like there's so\nmuch information out there sometimes be\nso difficult to understand what is fact\nand what exactly is fiction so I thought\nit might be just great to Jump Right In\nand to talk about what are the signs and\nsymptoms of a BPD\nyeah it's I'm really glad you wanted to\ntackle this uh topic because borderline\npersonality disorder is there's a lot of\nmyths around it and those myths\ncontinued to exist in the professional\nHealthcare world for a very long time we\nthought that this was a very extremely\nrare problem and you know a little over\num one percent about 1.4 percent of the\nUnited States population experiences\nborderline personality disorder but we\nused to think it was much more rare than\nthat and it was highly stigmatized\npeople who had this disorder were\nthought of being as really emotional\nthat they really overreact and that they\num they were seen as being very\nmanipulative that they manipulate\nrelationships to their benefit and there\nwas a lot of a lot of holly Hollywood\ndepictions of this type of problem that\nreally weren't uh weren't that great\nthat perpetuated a lot of these\nstereotypes that people would get really\nmanipulative when they thought their\nrelationship was going to come to an end\nand they'll do whatever it takes to kind\nof keep it going\nand then there is a wonderful person\nnamed Marsha Linehan who herself was\nstruggling with this problem and she was\nvery very much experiencing some of the\nsymptoms we're going to talk about she\nwas chronically suicidal she tried to\nget a lot of help this is back in the\n70s\nand while she had access to a lot of the\nbest health care at the time the best\nmental health care at the time none of\nit was working and so she basically\ndecided I am going to go get a doctorate\nmyself and I'm going to create a better\ntreatment for this and a lot of what we\nknow about borderline personality\ndisorder what it really is comes from a\nlot of the work that Dr Linehan has done\nand the treatments that she's developed\nso what we do know about it is there's\nthis core problem areas and I should say\nit's a it's a personality disorder\npersonality disorders how they're\ndifferent from other things like I\ntalked about I I've treated a lot of\nanxiety and anxiety related problems\nthose tend to be\neither more focused in what the problem\nis so for example if you're someone who\nhas social anxiety disorder it's a\nproblem that exists in very specific\ntypes of situations social situations\nwhere you feel like you're being judged\nor evaluated or maybe you might be\nexperiencing depression and it's it's\nonly gone on for a certain period of\nTime personality disorders are different\nbecause they tend to be a bit more\nbroader in what um in how they impact\nyou they impact many areas of your life\nand they also persist for a long time\nyou have that in other things like\ndepression can persist for a long time\nsocial anxiety can persist for a long\ntime there's bipolar disorder yes\nthere's all that sort of stuff but\npersonality disorders in general very\nbroad they continue for a long time and\nwe also tend not to diagnose them until\nyou're an adult so even though some of\nthe some symptoms and I'm about to talk\nabout they can exist if you're a\nteenager people are very hesitant to\nmake any type of diagnosis and we're\nreally not supposed to until you're\nolder because we need to see a long\nperiod of time that you've been\nexperiencing this\num before I go into symptoms let me\ncheck in Monica I was just talking like\nI feel like forever\num no it was that yeah great information\nhere I just wanted to pick on one of the\npoints that you said kind of about\ndiagnosing in adulthood rather than in\nadolescence is this just for borderline\npersonality disorder or kind of\npersonality disorders in general\npersonality disorders in general and\nthere's a few different reasons for that\none we know that your brain is it's\nstill developing until your mid uh 20s I\nthink around 25 is when your frontal\nlobe is finished developing\num a lot of your values and your sense\nof self are still developing too uh long\ninto your 20s and um the big the big\npersonality stuff it's not totally\nsolidified when you're a kid when you're\na teenager so anytime we're looking at\nany of the personality disorders there's\nnarcissistic personality disorder there\nis obsessive compulsive personality\ndisorder ocpd which is different than\nOCD obsessive-compulsive disorder those\nkind of things any of the personality\ndisorders we don't want to make that\ndiagnosis until someone is more\ndeveloped as as the person they're going\nto be but that's a really good question\nokay wonderful I think that's good for\nnow I'm following I'm falling if anyone\nelse is uh having questions as well just\nput in the chat I'm also following those\nand I'll kind of flag any ones that I\nthink are especially relevant for the\ncommunity\nyeah so the main problem areas of\nborderline personality disorder the\nfirst one is something called identity\nconfusion and people who have borderline\npersonality disorder struggle to\nunderstand who they are and how it's\ndifferent from other people and this can\nget really confusing in relationships\nsometimes you might feel a certain way\nin one relationship and if that\nrelationship is coming to an end you\nmight not really know well who who am I\nif I'm no longer with this person\nsometimes it can be hard to know kind of\nwhere your identity ends in someone\nelse's begins\num your identity can change and shift a\nlot over time and so\num that's one of the main problem areas\nthe next major problem area is related\nto impulsivity and impulsivity I don't\nreally like that it sounds so Technical\nand harsh but basically what what it\nmeans is sometimes it's really hard for\nyou to put on the brakes\nso if you are experiencing an emotion or\na thought it's very easy for you to act\non it and it's very hard for you to put\nthe brakes on it and we can see this in\na few different ways with borderline\npersonality disorder one of the ways is\nwith anger and this is something that\nparticularly happens with a lot of\npeople who identify more as as masculine\nor or male so you might get angry and\nthen you quickly react to that maybe you\nthrow something maybe you break\nsomething stuff like that with people\nwho identify more more feminine more as\na woman we see it act differently it\ntends to be more about self-injury or\nabout self-injury which might mean\ncutting yourself burning yourself things\nlike that but impulsivity can it doesn't\nhave to be about\num\naggression or about hurting yourself it\ncan also be about you have this thought\nabout like I really should say this to\nthat person and then you send that text\nwithout really thinking about it and\nmaybe it causes problems later on so\ndoing things really quickly without sort\nof thinking about them this is something\nthat other some other uh disorders share\nADHD is is another one where impulsivity\nis is common here um with ADHD it's more\nlike thoughts into your your head and\nyou might say those things you might do\nsome of those things it's hard to\ncontrol your body here it's more with\nborderline personality disorder you're\nkind of emotional you have this thought\nyou kind of react to it\nso that's impulsivity piece and then\nrelated to that is your emotions can\nfeel like they're going up and down and\nit's hard to sort of make them feel more\nmellow make them feel more in the middle\none of my supervisors described it as\npeople who have borderline personality\ndisorder their emotions quickly charge\nup and they're very slow to come down it\njust takes a lot longer to feel more\nkind of in the middle and to feel more\nlike yourself which contributes to that\nidentity confusion it contributes to the\nimpulsivity all these problem areas sort\nof impact each other and because of all\nof this stuff\nyou see a lot of problems with\nrelationships with your friends with\nyour family with romantic relationships\nit can feel like there's a lot of\nconflict with the people you're close to\nin your life uh friendships can feel\nlike they come they go they're really\nintense they're really close and then\nthey just sort of end and it feels like\na complete disaster a lot of young\npeople who have some of these problems\nthey might experience a lot of conflict\nwith their family it just really seems\nlike your family doesn't get it and so\nall of these things sort of impact each\nother and when we have borderline\npersonality disorder\nsomeone has all of these problems\nthey've had all these problems for a\nlong period of time and it's really\nmaking it difficult to to live their\nlives we might see people being\nchronically suicidal because of\nborderline personality disorder we might\nsee them developing other problems too\nlike depression or anxiety based\nproblems but it's these core areas that\nidentity confusion impulsivity\ndifficulty managing your emotions and\nthen a lot of relationship conflicts\nand do we often see this being comorbid\nwith other disorders you mentioned it\nbriefly but I'm quite curious like which\nones in particular I could it can be so\nmany Monica it's um I've seen I've I\nthink depression is very common\nsubstance use is also a lot of comp a\nlot of common that's not how we talk\nsubstance use is also very common and I\nthink those those things can make sense\nbecause if you keep experiencing a lot\nof the same types of problems that can\nbe very depressing and also if your\nemotions kind of feel like this it makes\nsense that you might use substances to\ntry to help you out with that\num so those two things can can come a\nlot um I've also seen a lot of anxiety\nbased problems with this I've seen\npeople who struggle with panic disorder\nI've seen people who um who struggle\nwith separation anxiety 80 because of\nthis all a lot of different problems can\ncan develop as as a result of this\nokay so just to summarize it's like\num identity confusion\num impulsivity just difficulty\nperforming like emotional regulation\nactivities\num just general kind of emotional\nturbulence almost and this can present\nin like problems with relationships so\nlet's say that someone kind of you said\nit better than me I just I just kind of\ntried to like put all the information\ntogether and um let's say there's\nsomeone who kind of gets a sense that\nthat's what they're experiencing\num they're not quite sure if like\nthey've got the disorder um what are\ntheir next steps what could they be\nlooking to do yeah that's a good\nquestion\num and I should say\nto some degree these things that I just\ndescribed\nare also pretty common with just being a\nteenager so\num if if you look at developmentally\nwhat's expected when you're in your\nteenage in adolescent years you're going\nto have some identity confusion you're\nprobably gonna try out a lot of\ndifferent identities\num your family is probably going to say\nYou're really emotional and you're\nyou're really impulsive and you're\nprobably experiencing a lot of conflict\nwith your friends with your your maybe\ntrying out different relationships\nyou're experiencing conflict there so to\nsome degree these things are totally\nexpected\nbut if you're wondering if you have this\nwhat to do\num there's a few different screening\ntools online that you can try out\nthere's a lot of great\num this is also coming from Marshall\nlinehan's\num her whole group and everyone else\nwho's really\num now focused on on this problem but\nthere's there's different things you can\nsort of fill out to get a sense of do I\nhave borderline personality disorder the\nbest thing to do is to go talk to a\nmental health expert because what\nthey're able to do is they're able to\nseparate out what is common and expected\nand just a normal part of growing up\nversus something that is now a problem\nand the way we Define a problem the way\nwe separate out what's normal and what\nis less common less normal is if it's\nreally getting in the way of your life\nif it's really causing you a lot of\nproblems in your life because when you\nhave borderline personality disorder\nit makes it hard to be in the workplace\nit makes it hard to be in school it\nmakes it hard to sustain relationships\nit makes it produces a lot of conflicts\nin your family and around the people\nthat are that are close to you and a\nmental health professional is going to\nbe the best person to be able to figure\nout how much of this is expected and how\nmuch of this is is not really expected\nthat's good to yeah it's definitely good\nto be able to know and to be able to\nspeak to a professional about this\nbecause I often see there's a lot of\nkind of self-diagnosis which is not very\nhelpful\num so yeah GPS could be a good uh First\nStep as well though I do know that\nsometimes it could be very difficult to\naccess\num like Primary Health Care Providers\nand mental health care providers\nyeah I think they're um this is\nsomething that I I often talk about is\n50 of people who have\num or are struggling with their mental\nhealth in some way\num they're gonna probably talk about it\nwith their general practitioner with\ntheir with a doctor that they trust that\nthey see regularly I think that is\nalways a really great place to get\nstarted and\num they might be able to answer some of\nyour questions or at least point you\ntowards the right person the\nself-diagnosis thing I did it myself all\nthroughout\nall throughout grad school in my first\nfew years practicing I think how can you\nnot right because you hear these things\nyou're like wait wait I struggle with\nthis but you don't really have the\ncontext of seeing what this is like when\nit is in a um clinically impairing way\nwhat does it look like\num and and the reality is\nevery mental health problem including\nthings like schizophrenia they all exist\non a spectrum you know if you're at home\nlate at night there's a rainstorm\nlightning outside your power goes out\nand you hear a sound in your mind you\nmight start imagining something that\nisn't quite there we all do that but\nwhen that happens a lot in different\nsituations well now you might be\nexperiencing more of a mental illness so\nlike everything in mental health is on a\nspectrum it's very easy to see ourselves\nin these problems but a professional is\nreally the one who can figure out is\nthis is this to be expected or is this\nactually getting in the way of your life\nthis is creating some real problems for\nyou let's let's talk about the best way\nto get treatment for this yeah I\ndefinitely remember in class there's\noften that talk about having it be a\nspectrum rather than it be kind of a yes\nand no like you have BPD or you don't\nhave BPD and I know that leaves us tons\nof possible\num like limitations and like chops down\na different direction but yeah\ndefinitely just good I think if someone\nis expecting some sort of like distress\nit's just good to talk to a GP or talk\nto a mental health professional because\nit's it's always good to just know\nwhat's happening\nyeah it's funny it's funny you mention\nthat Monica because one of the common\nproblems with borderline personality\ndisorder is people when they get really\nemotional they see things as all good or\nall bad or they see things as as yes or\nno they see things in these absolute\ncategories so a big part of the\ntreatment for borderline personality\ndisorder is to help people see more of\nthe spectrum and to see kind of the the\nwisdom in how both things can both be\ntrue and it doesn't have to be all this\nor all that\nyes you mentioned treatments\num just briefly should we go into more\ndepth about what kind of treatments are\navailable\num what help might look like for someone\nexperiencing BPD yeah yeah I'd love to I\nlove talking about treatment for\nborderline personality disorder because\na lot a lot of the stuff that we do for\nborderline personality disorder I think\nit just it could help everyone there are\na lot of really great things to come out\nof this that I think are just helpful\nfor everyone to know so for a long time\nthere wasn't really any treatments that\nwere very effective for borderline\npersonality disorder and now the most\nthe most studied uh treatment there's\nthere's a few different ones that are\nthat are effective but the most studied\none the one that you're probably going\nto hear all the time is something called\ndialectical behavior therapy that's a\ntreatment that was originally developed\nby by Dr Marshall Linehan it's been\nthere's just really great research\naround it\nwhat it means it's in the family of\ncognitive behavioral treatments\num cognitive behavioral treatments what\nthey do is they really help you to\num to learn new ways of approaching your\nthoughts of changing your environment of\ndeveloping skills to\num to improve the way you're acting in\ndifferent situations to make it easier\nto overcome some of these problems like\nthat's kind of broadly how I Define CBT\nDBT is one of those treatments and the\nway Dr Linehan did it is so she defined\nokay what are the core problems of of\nborderline personality disorder we we\ngot those all defined what are things\nthat help you with those problems so\nwith BPD we've got identity confusion\nand one of the the core skill I would\nsay of of DBT uh is uh oh man we could\nget lost in these acronyms BPD dpd so in\na main problems of borderline\npersonality disorders identity confusion\none of the main treatments of\ndialectical behavior therapy is\nmindfulness mindfulness\nit's super popular right now a lot of\npeople think it's about like meditation\nand being Zen and all of that sort of\nstuff\nreally simply mindfulness it's it's not\nabout feeling better but it's about\nfeeling more it's sort of like the pause\nbutton that helps you to better\nunderstand what's happening around you\nwhat's happening inside of you and to be\nable to sit with that without reacting\nwithout judging that's that's how I like\nto think of of mindfulness and so\nmindfulness is a skill to help with\nidentity confusion\nimpulsivity reacting to things Without\nReally with the difficulty pressing the\nbrakes what helps with that well DBT has\na huge skill set called distress\ntolerance these are things that help you\nlike I said before your emotions get\nreally active really quickly distress\ntolerance skills help them to bring them\ndown to a level so that it's easier to\nsit with them so they're less\noverwhelming so you don't feel that urge\nto act on them\nuh difficulty regulating managing your\nemotions uh DBT has a skill set related\nto emotion regulation I think about\ndistress tolerance as stuff you do in\nthe moment to help you feel less\nintensity whereas emotion regulation\nthese are skills that you you do right\nnow to kind of set you up for success in\nthe future so for example a distress\ntolerance skill might be like going out\nfor exercise like my heart is racing I'm\nso mad so I'm gonna go for a run that's\ndistress tolerance making sure I get a\ngood night of sleep is emotion\nregulation because that sets me up for a\nbetter day tomorrow and then there are a\nwhole set of of skills related to\ninterpersonal Effectiveness to help you\ndeal with all the relationship problems\nthat that you might run into so for\nexample a lot of people with borderline\npersonality disorder they have a hard\ntime saying no to someone\nso there's a skill called dear man which\nis all about assertiveness and how do\nyou clearly say no or clearly express\nyour needs it's a super\nsuper straightforward treatment\num but it's also a lot to learn and\nthere's a lot to do in there my favorite\npart about DBT is um if you if you're so\nlucky to find a full DBT program that\ndoes all of this stuff the coolest part\nof it is phone coaching so when you're\nin an emotional crisis when your\nemotions are all revved up you can\nactually pick up your phone call your\ntherapist or you can text your therapist\nand they'll get back to you and they'll\nhelp coach you through how to use these\nskills in the moment and that's where\nthe magic of DVT really really happens\nanother big part of DBT there's a lot of\ntracking a lot of monitoring a lot of\nlearning how the stuff inside of you is\nimpacting the people around you\nwow that that was a lot of good\ninformation I think it's really nice how\nit tackles like each specific component\ncomponent of um BPD so one for identity\nconfusion one for kind of managing um\nemotions one for impulsivity so it's\nreally great to tackle all that and I'm\nsure they all kind of work in Tandem and\nthey all require the help of a\nprofessional and given that I know\nprofessional help is sometimes\ninaccessible for many other people many\npeople in general actually\num do you have any thoughts on what\nsomeone could do\num like even now um what they can do to\nkind of get started and find sorry a way\nto cope with BPD\nyeah\num I think learning a lot about what the\nproblem is and\num and and\nthat's a great starting point because I\nthink a lot of people might feel a lot\nof Shame around this and that's that's\ncommon with a lot of\num mental health problems um shame is a\nbig problem to overcome to actually\ngetting help I think it's very common\nwith BPD because there's such a history\nof ignorance and stigma and\nmisinformation about it even in the\nHealthcare Community and it's you know\nonly a few decades ago that we really\nstarted to Define what this problem is\nso because of that anything that you can\ndo to better understand it\num I think is going to really go a long\nway to to feeling like okay this is just\nlike one thing that I'm experiencing and\nit's I I always tell people it's not\nyour fault that you you are experiencing\nthis problem BPD is usually caused by a\nbiological component some people just\nhave a stronger emotional temperament\nthey're just born that way they're just\nborn with their with the volume on their\nemotions turned up and then maybe\nthey've gone through they've had some\ndifficult childhood experiences the more\ntrauma and adverse experiences you have\nas a kid whether it's a traumatic thing\nyou went through or a lot of stressful\nthings you went through maybe you moved\naround a lot your your parents separated\nyou had the loss of a parent so many\nthings can happen but the more\ndifficulty yet as a child the more\ndifficult it is for you to regulate your\nemotions and then people who have that\ntemperament they've gone through\ndifficult things they tend to have a bad\nfit between their family and how their\nfamily is interacting to their emotions\nso this is not your fault\nthis is not your fault at all it is this\nis the dialectic here the the D in DBT\nis a dialectic how how think we\nunderstand things in relation to each\nother and how things are related to each\nother it's not your fault and at the\nsame time it is your problem it is\nsomething you have to learn about you\nhave to learn how to overcome all that\nstuff so I'd say anything you can do to\nunderstand it better is a really good\nstarting point and\num one of my favorite DBT skills is\nsomething called chain analysis Monica\nhave you ever heard this term before\nI've heard it I think I was reading I\nthink I was reading the DSM and then\ngoing down to Rabbit Hole I'm not\nquestioning the details so I'd love to\nhear from you\nI love a good old DSM Rabbit Hole yeah\nthe starting point of everything I need\nto know and then I have to of course do\nmore Googling but anyways yeah I feel\nlike\nI feel like that's the most like psych\nto go thing that you could possibly be\ndoing is going through a DSA of rabbit\nhole I love it\num so the chain analysis is so it's such\na useful skill so basically what happens\nis something's happen in your life\nyou're not happy about it\nmaybe your friend said something\nyou emotionally reacted back and they\nsaid something had escalated and now you\nsaid like I don't want to talk to you I\nhate you you know you sent them these\nnasty texts all that sort of you're at\nhome you're crying about it you're angry\nabout it\num and it's still kind of festering the\nnext day this is a great time to do a\nchain analysis where a chain analysis is\nit's like a bunch of bubbles like chains\nconnected on a piece of paper and you\nkind of write down okay what's the\nproblem that happened problem is that I\nI yelled and said nasty things to my\nfriend and then you kind of go back and\nyou go okay what happened right before\nthat what happened right before that\nwhat happened right before that what\nwere you thinking what were you feeling\nwhat were you doing and you try to go\nback to the beginning of the day the day\nbefore all that sort of stuff and what\nwe usually find is okay you yelled at\nyour friend but you were also right\nbefore that maybe you saw your friend\nhanging out with someone that you're not\nthat close to and you kind of felt\nreally alienated from them you felt like\nthey rejected you and that whole day you\nweren't feeling that well probably\nbecause you woke up late you didn't have\nyour breakfast you didn't sleep that\nwell so the whole morning you were not\nset up to have a good day and and you\nkind of you can go even farther back\nthan that as well if you want\nand then we kind of identify there's so\nmany things that probably contributed to\nthis blow up that happened between you\nand your friend and so now we got all\nthe chains in order then we do a\nsolution analysis okay where might be\none place where we could intervene\nwhere's one place where we could have\ndone a different skill it was probably\nnot right before you blew up at your\nfriend that was it was probably too late\nthen but maybe we can start it with the\nmorning maybe if we do something\ndifferent with the morning you can have\na different afternoon and what I like\nabout chain analysis when you kind of\nlay everything out it makes so much\nsense like oh this is why I did that\nthing it's not because I'm like a\nhorrible person it's because I was\nreally having a bad day and there was a\nlot of reasons why I was having a bad\nday so I love doing chain analyzes and\nthey just help you to understand\nyourself better and they also help you\nto feel like it's um like you're not a\nhorrible person but there's reasons\nbehind this stuff it's probably my\nfavorite DBT skill\nso it's really breaking things down and\ntrying to analyze things and making\nsense of them because once someone's\nable to kind of identify and understand\nthe motivation behind these behaviors\nthen they can better apply the\ntechniques to hopefully not repeat the\nsame situation again\ntotally totally and once you have an\nunderstanding of that then you're better\npositioned to do some of the other\nskills that you learn in DBT DBT is it's\nuh there's so many metaphors in it but\none another one that I like is a lot of\ntimes we get uh I was kind of talking\nabout how people with borderline\npersonality disorder they get all good\nall bad all yes all no uh all black all\nwhite all that kind of stuff and one of\nthose one of those things is getting all\nemotional or all analytical and a chain\nanalysis is really useful when you're\nvery emotional to kind of pull you back\ninto a place where you're kind of\nthinking about it in a more\nstraightforward way DBT would call that\nbeing in a wise mind wise mind is the\nintegration of emotion and sort of logic\nor rationale and kind of combining the\ntwo together uh you said it really well\nlike once you understand\nhow this came to be then you're better\npositioned for the future of approaching\nit differently\nso any other resources that you'd like\nto think of like to point the community\ntowards for the readings because I love\nso much so there's so much they're so\nthere's so much there's a ton of DBT\nworkbooks out there that I think are a\nreally good resource where you can learn\nsome of these skills but my favorite\npsych to go I know you guys have you all\nhave the most beautiful amazing\nanimations I'm always very jealous of\nyour videos for having these really\nclear-cut simple easy to understand\nvideos I love it and so I was thinking\nabout what would be a good resource for\nyou all so I want to recommend\nRocksteady I I might even have it here\nin my oh no I don't\ndo I have okay hey Monica check it out\nokay guys wonderful\num this book I love it's Rocksteady\nbrilliant advice from my bipolar Life by\nEllen Forney now I know it says bipolar\nlife but basically what this book is\nit's it's sort of like uh let's see if I\ncan cut down the glare it's a graphic\nnovel how-to of DBT skills\num it's awesome and it's the sequel to A\nbook this this author wrote called\nmarbles\num which is I think the best depiction\nof of bipolar uh depression\num but she did such an amazing job\nputting DBT skills together in a book\num if you're only looking for like one\nquick easy to understand thing this has\nmost of the the biggest DBT skills in it\neven though it doesn't say Borderline\nPersonality Disorder so I would pick up\nEllen forney's Rocksteady uh I think\nit's a great resource and and then um\nthere are so many there's so many DBT\nskills out there there's so many things\nyou can learn let me just kind of\nmention my favorites really quick so\nthere's a ton of stuff on mindfulness\nyou can kind of learn and all about that\nyourself a lot of great resources on\nYouTube my favorite emotion regulation\nskills there's um the tip skill which is\nabout uh temperature\nintensity is it pressure I don't know\num but there's some like basic things\nyou can do like progressive muscle\nrelaxation slow breathing intense\nphysical exercise and then the dive\nreflex I've got a great video about how\nto do the dive Reflex on my channel\nthese are all things that can really\nquickly bring your emotions down I would\nlearn some of those skills those are the\neasiest skills to do when it comes to\nDBT\nand then I mentioned it before but the\ndear man skill is probably one of the\nbest interpersonal skills about how to\nassert yourself what to say so you're\nnot taking advantage of so that you say\nno when you want to say no and that you\ncan get the help that you need when when\nyou need it those would be some of the\nbiggest DBT skills I would say that\neveryone can benefit from and and\neveryone can learn\nthank you so much and I just wanted
