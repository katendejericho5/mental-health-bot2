    "transcript": "hey psych2goers in our first video we\nchatted with dr mike about the physical\nand mental health relationship who to\nreach out to for support and how you can\nmaintain or improve your mental\nwell-being stay until the end to learn\npractical tips on managing your body and\nmind thoughts on any resources that\nmight be useful for just the general\npublic to read on about mental wellness\nfor sure so i have sort of like i would\nsay two books that i recommend quite\noften to my patients as one is an\nintroduction to cognitive behavioral\ntherapy it's called feeling good there's\nactually an updated version called\nfeeling great by david burns great\nauthor great book has work book within a\nbook so you're kind of like not\npassively reading you're actively\nreading and then filling stuff out and\nlearning about yourself in the process\ni've read it i've got tremendous benefit\nfrom it i was actually introduced to it\nby our behavioral specialist in my\nresidency program who kind of helped\nteach us who helped take care of us when\nwe were struggling as residents that\nbook did wonders for me and there's some\npreliminary research showing that\nbibliotherapy just reading that book\nalone from mild symptoms goes a really\nlong way to helping alleviate them so\nthat's one that i often use as an\nintroduction for cognitive behavioral\ntherapy and then when it comes to how\nyour physical health is impacted by your\nmental health there's an author by by\nthe name of dr sarno the late dr sarna\none is called the divided mind and often\ntimes if i feel a patient is coming in\nwith a physical manifestation of a\nmental health situation common example\nof this would be low back pain or some\nother musculoskeletal complaint where\ni'm like look we've ruled everything out\nanatomically you're okay there is no\nnerve impingement the muscles are intact\nthere's no major spasms you have good\nrange of motion but you are having pain\nit's not all in your head but it's\nhappening as a result of what's going on\nin your head and that's part of life\nthat's like what our bodies do naturally\nit really stems from the science of pain\nperception because i think something\neveryone can relate to is if you're\nhaving an ache no matter what it is\nstomachache elbow ache backache and you\ngo to a party and you're having fun with\nfriends i guarantee you you're feeling\nthat ache less like you're on adrenaline\nyou're having a good time you're feeling\nit less but if you were to receive some\nbad news i guarantee you that ache\nbecomes intensified and it's not again\njust all in your head you're making it\nup it's true the pain is true your\nbody's perceiving it differently but\nthat's because of what's going on in\nyour mind in your mental health state\nand that's what the book the divided\nmind really dives into as to why our\nminds do this dr sarno postulates some\ninteresting theories as to why our\nbodies do this something he talks about\nis repressed childhood trauma emotions\nhow they potentially if they're being\nrepressed and untapped that our bodies\nare actually creating some of these\nphysical manifestations to prevent us\nfrom thinking about that and i think\nthere's definitely something there i\ndon't think it's fully fleshed out yet\nbut to me it's interesting it's an\ninteresting field of research it's an\ninteresting part of reading because i've\nhad patients who've come in with these\nmanifestations physically that nothing\nmedically i can give them a diagnosis on\nthe mri is normal the imaging is normal\nthe function of it is normal but there's\npain and then we dive into the mental\nhealth side of things and all of a\nsudden the pain is gone i've actually\nhad an interesting interaction with the\npatient i mentioned elbow pain several\ntimes because she came in after three\nvisits with other doctors elbow was\nbothering her mri was normal x-ray's\nnormal functionally looks okay had some\nphysical therapy no improvement i bring\nup this topic she was very reluctant to\ntalk about her emotions but then was\nsaid you know what i want to try it\nbecause the elbow is bothering me i\nasked her to give me a call back to give\nme an update in a couple of weeks see\nhow she's doing no call so i was kind of\nupset i said you know what maybe i\nshould call and just make sure\neverything's okay and when i called her\nshe said you know i'm kind of upset with\nyou doctor why are you upset what's\ngoing on and she says because my elbow\npain is gone\nand like why are you upset if your elbow\npain's gone because she says you know\nnow it makes me feel like it was all in\nmy head and we have to have that\nconversation about it's not all in your\nhead this is part of how your body\nperceives pain if there's some kind of\ntrauma there your body will act\ndifferently you will perceive pain\ndifferently your experiences in the\nworld will be subjectively different and\nthat's normal again it's so important to\ntalk about because it's how the body\ncopes part of its natural mechanisms and\ni wish we put that out there more\nbecause i feel like we would have a lot\nless sham medicine of miracle cures we'd\nhave a lot less imaging that is\nunnecessary and we have a lot less\nsurgeries and procedures that patients\ndon't need but then end up suffering\nfrom because of the side effects of\nthese procedures if you're feeling good\nyou're releasing endorphins those are\nnatural pain relievers it's almost like\nour own opioid system within our own\nbodies so like the fact that we feel\nless pain when things are good goes to\nshow that there's something happening\nmentally that's affecting this really\nsimple question i ask patients is you\nknow does your back hurt or does your\nhead hurt only on weekdays\nand if they say yes what happens on\nweekends oh weekends i'm off i'm not\nstressed from work i'm having a good\ntime i'm with my family i'm happy well\nwhy is that if you have a broken bone if\nyou have pressure on your nerve if you\nhave a tumor god forbid why would it\ntake weekends off like medically it\ndoesn't make sense so we have to start\nlooking elsewhere and figuring out why\nit's happening with that pattern and\nthat goes back to that cascading pathway\nand figuring out the diagnosis in the\nbeginning and that's why the mental and\nphysical health relationship is so cool\nbut at the same time there's a lot of\nstigma around it so patients aren't\nalways open to having that conversation\nsome have experienced true traumas that\nthey're not comfortable sharing\nespecially meeting me for the first time\nif i'm not their primary doctor that\nmakes things even more tricky that's my\nfield of learning where i'm trying to\nfigure out how to get patients excited\nmotivated and looking deeper into\nthemselves to become more introspective\nright mental health and physical health\nas you just described as we just chatted\nit's just so it's almost inseparable i\nwould say sometimes it's unfortunate\nthat's quite difficult for people to\nreach out and i think one of the\ndifficulties is that there are so many\ndifferent types of health care providers\nfor example social workers psychiatrists\npsychologists you name it that it's hard\nto know who to reach out to first like\nprimary care that's why like if you have\nprimary care they'll help you guide this\nthe system is complicated like you're so\nright on this even for me like when i\nhave something wrong and i need\nspecialty care i'm confused i'm like who\ndo i go see like i need to start digging\ninto my roller decks or maybe even using\nour references that we use for you know\nmedical conditions to see like who's the\noptimal person to refer this patient is\nit ear nose and throat is it maxo facial\nsurgeon like who is the best person to\ntake care of this because sometimes\nthings are very sub-specialized and you\ndon't know who to see so the fact is if\nyou have a good primary care doc who\ncares who understands the system they'll\nbe able to guide you if you need a\nsocial worker counselor and sometimes a\ncounselor may not be enough for the\nseverity of the case that a patient has\nmaybe a patient needs an inpatient stay\nmaybe after their inpatient state they\nmay need an intense outpatient program\nwhere they're going every single day to\nthis program and i've had patients\nbenefit greatly from doing these\nintensive outpatient programs as well as\ninpatient programs but unless you're\naware that they're available you may not\ntake advantage and the only way you can\nreally know outside of doing like a lot\nof serious digging and research is have\na good primary care doctor and be\nplugged in so after someone reaches out\nto their primary care provider\npresumably it would take some time to\nactually meet them so in the meantime do\nyou have any recommendations on what\nsomeone can do to either maintain\nwellness or to just feel better for the\ntime being it's so hyper dependent it's\nhard to give generalized advice here i\njust think like everyone could benefit\nfrom cognitive behavioral therapy i\nthink even if you're not having a\nquote-unquote diagnosis you could still\nbenefit from cognitive behavioral\ntherapy because we're all so prone to\ndisorder thoughts where you know i\ndidn't get an a so i'm a failure my\npartner was looking at their phone a\nlittle longer than usual they're\ncheating on me like these thoughts pop\ninto all of our minds they can really\nderail how we feel if you feel a certain\nway whether you're feeling down angry\nsad if someone tells you to snap out of\nit they're kind of being rude because\nyou can't really control your feelings\nbut you do have some control over your\nthoughts so if we can attack some of\nthose disordered thoughts through\ncognitive behavioral therapy even from\nthe knowledge of cognitive behavioral\ntherapy it can go a long way so for\neveryone i recommend doing at least the\ninitial reading of feeling good or\nfeeling great general gist and\nunderstanding of what's going on and\nsomething that kind of a hack or a tip\nthat i like using is some of these\nsimple almost gimmicky things but that\nactually have evidence behind them that\nyou can do one is like the letter of\ngratitude basically in the field of\npositive psychology it's been found that\nif you write a letter of gratitude to\nsomeone who you're grateful to whether\nit's a family member friend doesn't\nreally matter you write it out but you\ndon't send it you call you meet the\nperson and you read it to them in person\nand oftentimes it's an incredibly\nemotional experience obviously depending\non who you choose how you choose to read\nit and the benefit in terms of\ndecreasing anxiety and depressive\nsymptoms just by reading that one letter\nto one person and writing it there's\nweeks of relief or at least a slight\ndecrease in symptoms that's been\nvalidated in scientific research the\nsecond one that's probably more\nwell-known is the three positive things\nat the end of the day jotting down on\nyour phone on a piece of paper three\ngood things that happen to you there's\nslightly different variations you could\ndo three good things with one sentence\nas to why you think they happened\nthere's three good things that you can\nwrite how you earned those three good\nthings like for example if i say oh bear\nmy dog behaved well today and my reason\ncould be because i took a lot of time to\ntrain bear and that is useful for\nsomeone who may be having problems with\nself-confidence so we can add those\nlittle boosters in in addition to the\nthree good things that also has been\nvalidated for decreasing depressive and\nanxiety features if you do it for a\nperiod of two weeks and yet again\nmultiple weeks after you even\ndiscontinue doing it of relief of your\nsymptoms and again it's not a cure-all\nit's just something you can do that is\njust a healthy exercise for your brain\nalmost how i can tell a patient you know\noh walking is healthy for you or\nmovement is healthy for you this is a\nform of brain exercise that's good for\nyou because our brains are so attuned to\nbeing anxious and nervous in order to\nsurvive and now that our worlds have\nbecome safer we need to sort of retune\nthem back to enjoy things and be happy\nand be optimistic and something\ninteresting that my behavioral\nspecialist in my office said to me the\nother day is\ntherapists call optimism a form of\nfunctional delusion which is funny\nbecause optimism is a good thing right\nbut yet it's a delusion and the reason\nwhy it's a delusion is because validated\nscientific research separated folks into\ntwo categories those who were optimists\nand those who were more pessimistic and\nthey gave them scenarios short term\nmedium term and long term and they try\nto have them predict how the outcomes\nwould happen in the world and every\nsingle time the pessimists were more\naccurate in their predictions the\noptimists were less accurate so they\nwere almost delusional in how they\nthought the future would go but the\noptimists were healthier they had a\nhappier life\nduring that time they met more of their\ngoals and they achieved more so it's\nlike maybe if you're pessimistic you\nmight be more accurate but then you're\nmissing out on some of the positivity\nthat is life and that's where that\nbalance comes into play that you can't\nalways be optimistic and fully happy all\nthe time but you can't also be\npessimistic because it's going to take a\ntoll on your body and mind so much so\nthat you won't have the longevity and\nthe joy that you would if you were\nsomewhere in between any other\npersonality trait typically associated\nwith people leading happier healthier\nlives apart from the things that people\nthink of like optimism\nyes so like this is really interesting\nso we talked about gratitude right yeah\nimportant thing in order to have a\nhealthy mindset and there's some recent\nresearch that i've looked into about how\nthere's something even more powerful\nthan gratitude in terms of keeping\nhappiness levels up and fighting off\nfeelings of depression or hopelessness\nespecially during a time like the\npandemic and that's looking forward to\nthe future like not predicting the\nfuture but being excited about the\nfuture and it's something that i\npersonally experienced and then when i\nwas exploring it with my own\npsychologist that i'm seeing for myself\nthroughout the pandemic i realized that\nthis is actually a new form of research\nand i'll give you my personal example my\ncoping mechanism that has worked very\nwell for me doesn't work for everybody\nwas looking forward to the future so if\ni had one month in an icu that i was\nworking and i was working seven days a\nweek six days a week whatever it was you\nknow people say how do you function\naren't you sad i wasn't because i knew\nafter that month i was gonna go play\nbasketball i was gonna be with my\nfriends and i would look forward to that\nor if i had a long hospital shift i\nwouldn't be sad because i would say\nafterwards i'm gonna go watch a movie or\nnetflix whatever hang out there so it'd\nalways be like thinking about the future\nto not feel sad about the present and\nthat was my coping mechanism the\npandemic took that away because the\npandemic there was no certainty there\nwas less social communication there was\nless ability to go play basketball\nespecially in the beginning when we\ndidn't know what was going on and\nbecause of that my coping mechanism was\nessentially taken away from me and i\nstarted suffering that's why i needed to\nget help and i realized that i started\nworking with this therapist and she told\nme about some research that was being\ndone testing whether gratitude or\nlooking forward towards the future like\ni was doing is my coping mechanism was\nmore powerful they started doing this\nwith war veterans they started to see\nthat war veterans who look towards the\nfuture actually had healthier levels of\nsatisfaction in life and less feelings\nof hopelessness in comparison to those\nwho use gratitude as their strategy so\nthat also is another area where okay if\ngratitude isn't working for you if the\nthree good things isn't working for you\ntry looking forward to the future and\nthat may not always be possible with the\ncircumstances especially in the middle\nof a pandemic but maybe there's small\nwins that you can have there for example\nin order for me to have something to\nlook forward in the future i bought a\npiano and i started i want to learn how\nto play the piano or i bought a new game\nand a video game and i was like you know\nwhat i want to play this video game when\ni would be working a long shift i would\nsay at least i can come home and play my\nvideo game so it's about creating things\nand finding unique ways to look forward\nto the future and again there's no one\nway to do that it's so individualized\nthat's why it's good to work with\nsomeone who is objective like a mental\nhealth specialist or a primary care\ndoctor because they can not feel the\nemotions you're feeling not be misguided\nby your emotional reasoning and actually\njust give you some objective data points\nor objective advice that you can use to\nhelp yourself what do you think about\nlooking forward to the future is\nparticularly helpful do you think it\ncomes along with aspect of hope or more\nlike excitement or just another method\nof social support if you get to do it\nwith people if we like really break it\ndown there's multiple variables there\nyou have the excitement that comes with\nthe future right that things will be\ncool things will be better because you\ndon't know how it's going to be and when\nyou don't know how things will play out\nbut you're excited there's like it's\nalmost like a form of optimism that\nyou're excited about it next is the\nsocial connection that if you're excited\nto see your friends not feeling as\nlonely as you might be in that moment\nand then the final one that comes to my\nmind is distraction if you're having\npain and i start talking to you and\ndistracting you you might not feel that\npain as much so if your brain oh man i'm\nworking this long shift and i'm tired\nand you keep saying that to yourself\nyou're gonna feel worse but if instead\nyou're distracting yourself by getting\nexcited about the future you're changing\nyour hormonal profile so you're working\non that neuroendocrine system by like\nstarting thinking about positive things\nso you're getting excited about that\nyou're not feeling and thinking about\nthe moment now maybe tough to get\nthrough and i think that sort of\ndistraction probably even though it's\nthe less sexy one of all of them is\nprobably the one that's most effective\nyeah i can confirm i did research on the\neffects of distraction on pain\nperception and we found similar things\noh really\nso essentially we gave people rewards to\neither focus on a distraction task or to\nnot reward them as much and then we\nwould rate have them rate subjectively\ntheir pain perception when we would give\nthem kind of like a hot kind of stimulus\nyeah and of course they would rate the\ntrials where they were rewarded more to\nfocus on distraction tasks as less\npainful that would shout out\nthe ice water test right that like yeah\npeople put their hand in ice water and\nyou say supportive things to them as\nopposed to like grill them or like\nheckle them they'll spend way less time\nin the water so like imagine like\nessentially if you're in a tough day job\nthat's like your hand being in the water\nand you thinking of how bad it is is you\nheckling yourself as opposed to thinking\nabout the future is you basically saying\nsupportive things to yourself and i\nthink that's where like you get a lot of\nthe benefit right for sure i think we\nestablished very clearly to the audience\nas well that mental health and physical\nhealth are just inseparable they're so\nclosely related to never hesitate\nhopefully to seek out for help do your\ngp first if needed and so i'd like to\njust finish off by asking whether you\nhave any pieces of advice for the psycho\ncommunity or the community at large yeah\nfor the psych to goers i think an\nimportant point is if you do end up\nseeking help there's a couple of things\nthat can go wrong when it comes to\nmental health being tied to physical\nhealth one is that your doctor or\nwhoever you're seeing the provider might\nnot take into account your mental health\nand that's a failure on the medical\nsystem and there's a second way it could\nfail which can happen but is rare which\nis where they blame a lot of the\nphysical symptoms on the mental health\nside of things without fully doing an\ninvestigation of the physical health\nbecause it's very easy to have a patient\nwho is battling with severe anxiety to\ncome into a medical office because i've\nseen this happen and say doctor i'm\nhaving back pain and i'm really worried\nabout it something's not right\njust my back is killing me and for the\ndoctor to write that off as a symptom of\nsevere anxiety as opposed to\ninvestigating it thoroughly what a good\ndoctor does is take into consideration\nboth factors make sure that your doctors\nare doing both they're ruling out\nphysical manifestations meaning you're\ndoing a thorough history they're doing a\nthorough physical exam they're checking\nlab work or imaging as appropriate\nbecause if a patient comes and they're\nfeeling down out of nowhere nothing\nchanges in their life i should be\nordering a thyroid test to see if\nthere's something going on with their\nthyroid i should be checking if they\nhave an issue with anemia like physical\nmanifestations of that and once those\nare ruled out we can address the mental\nhealth stuff and then say that we\nsuspect that it's due to that we could\nalso address the mental health stuff\nsimultaneously but you can't solely\nblame mental health until you rule out\nthe physical health because\nunfortunately we only have one physical\nbody and if you start ruling out chest\npain as just always just anxiety that's\nthe quickest way to have a patient have\na serious heart attack and lose their\nlife we really need to be attuned that\nit's mind body not body not mind and not\nget overly focused on one or the other\nthank you so much for your wonderful\ninsight for your time and for sharing\nyour thoughts to me and to the psychical\ncommunity yeah thanks monica if anybody\nwants to watch i have a few videos on\nmental health and trauma that expand\nupon all the stuff that we talk about on\nmy channel so go ahead and check that\nout as always stay happy and healthy"
