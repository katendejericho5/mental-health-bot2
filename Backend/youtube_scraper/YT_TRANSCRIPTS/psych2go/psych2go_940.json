    "transcript": "- [Amanda] Hey, Psych2goers.\nCan a narcissist fall in love?\nThe short answer is yes.\nHowever, it's probably\nnot the type of love\nyou are thinking of right now.\nLove is different for everybody.\nThis applies especially well\nin the case of narcissists.\nSince they have psychological deficits\nthat impact emotional assessment,\nthey tend to show their love\nin a weird, selfish way.\nSo if you are an average person\nwho sees love as something along\nthe lines of understanding,\nacceptance, and compromise,\nthen you are in for a surprising ride,\nbecause this is what truly happens\nwhen a narcissist falls in love.\nBefore we begin, this video is\nfor educational purposes only\nand is not intended to be a substitute\nfor professional advice or diagnosis.\nWith that said, here is what happens\nwhen a narcissist falls in love with you.\n(brooding music)\nNumber one, they won't change.\nYou may think that when a\nnarcissist truly falls in love,\nthey change for the better.\nUnfortunately, in most\nsituations, that is not the case.\nResearch shows that they\nhave structural abnormalities\nin brain regions associated\nwith emotional empathy.\nAnd because of that,\nthey tend to turn abusive\nor remain self-absorbed.\nNumber two, they're turbulent\nin their ways of affection.\nNarcissists can be\nextremely warm one second\nand cold the next.\nIt's also common for them\nto love bomb their partners.\nSince they're playing a game\nof wanting to receive praise\nand admiration, they know\nexactly which buttons to push\nto elicit a good reaction.\nHowever, since the act\nof receiving pleasure\nis somewhat like a game to them,\nthey naturally lose\ninterest once they win it\nor receive the prize.\nSo, it won't be a surprise when one moment\nthey're buying gifts\nand booking honeymoon\ntickets for their partners\nand breaking up with them the next.\nNumber three, they prefer\ncasual dating or long distance.\nCommitment is a difficult thing\nto expect from narcissists.\nSince their sponges of attention,\na single person's appreciation\nwill tire them out quickly.\nFor them, the more people to\nreceive praise from the better.\nThis is why they're especially comfortable\nwith casual dating or being in\nlong distance relationships.\nIn these types of setups,\nthere are low expectations for intimacy,\nbut enough opportunities\nto satisfy their desire.\nDo any of these ring a\nbell so far?
