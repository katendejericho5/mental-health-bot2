internalize\nbeauty standards from society these\nstandards can often contribute to having\na negative body image and are made even\nmore prominent by our age of social\nmedia here are six signs you struggle\nwith body image number one obsessive\nbody checking it's a normal and natural\nthing for us to look at ourselves in the\nmirror on a daily basis we all gaze at\nthe mirror to see if we look presentable\nfor instance but for people who struggle\nwith body image body checking can become\nobsessive\nbesides the mirror there are other ways\nyou might check your body these include\nusing your hands or a tape measure\nweighing yourself checking the tightness\nof your clothes and comparing yourself\nto others\nif body checking makes you stop or limit\nyour eating causes you to isolate\nyourself from others or it becomes a way\nto control your fear and anxiety about\nyour body it can become problematic the\nbehavior often increases your\npreoccupation and dissatisfaction with\nyour body many people are unaware of how\nfrequently they engage in body checking\nand the method they do so an increased\nawareness of this might help you be able\nto reduce this behavior and improve body\nimage\nnumber two\nobsessing over food and exercise when\nyou perceive your body in a negative way\noften times you may try to take steps to\nshape it into something you'd want to\nsee putting yourself on restrictive\ndiets and other weight control behaviors\nmay seem like the only option for you to\nbe happy with your body instead of doing\nthese things for your health and\nwell-being you're only driven by what\nyou see in the mirror over engaging in\nhabits you may associate with being\nhealthy such as calorie counting and\ntaking body measurements could actually\nbe signs of poor body image it may be\nhelpful to check in with yourself\nfrequently and ensure that food or the\nskill have not become a way to control\nyour life\nif you start to have thoughts about food\nand exercise that lead to a worsened\nmood making an effort to create thoughts\nthat make you feel more in control can\nlead to better outcomes for example\ninstead of calling yourself a failure\nfor gaining a few pounds try to\nestablish yourself as someone who\ndoesn't let the scale change their mood\nnumber three your body image and mood\nare correlated\nbody image is something that can\nfluctuate from day to day on some days\nyou may feel great about how you look\nwhile on others you may be feeling\nfrustrated or embarrassed about your\nbody destroying your confidence\nas body image is something that can\noften shift the mood of those with an\nunhealthy relationship with their body\nMay often be based on how they feel in\ntheir skin according to the UK mental\nhealth Foundation body dissatisfaction\nis associated with a poorer quality of\nlife and psychological distress while\nbody satisfaction has been linked to\nbetter overall well-being if your mood\nruns on how you feel when you see\nyourself in the mirror your body image\nMay hold a significant weight in your\nlife\n[Music]\nnumber four you camouflage when picking\nan outfit to wear do you find yourself\nwearing loose oversized clothes\ngoing on from how one's mood can be\nlinked to how one feels in their body\nthose struggling with body image may\ntake some steps to make them feel better\nand more comfortable for instance they\nmight wear loose or oversized clothing\nwhile some people do this because it\nmakes them feel more body positive\nOthers May do it out of fear of judgment\naccording to the psychotherapist Deborah\nKlinger those who have dealt with body\nshame are especially inclined to wear\nclothes that camouflage their bodies\nsince people with poor body image often\nfeel that their body is prone to\njudgment from others wearing clothes\nthat hide the body can help alleviate\nthis fear\nnumber five you frequently compare your\nbody to others online\ndo you find yourself comparing your body\nto others\nwhile comparing ourselves to others is\nnatural making body comparisons to\nunrealistic standards is a Surefire way\nto break a positive body image a 2015\nstudy by psychologists Jasmine far Dolly\nand Lenny vartanian showed that\nappearance comparisons to idealized\nimages are often associated with\nnegative outcomes in one study\nparticipants comparing themselves to\nothers in person had less negative\noutcomes such as less body\ndissatisfaction than when they compared\nthemselves to others online if you find\nyourself often comparing your body to\nothers online it might be a contributor\nto poor body image detoxing your feed or\nunfollowing triggering accounts that\nmake you feel worse about your\nappearance can potentially improve your\nbody image and number six there's always\nsomething to fix about your body\nwhen you look in the mirror do you\nalways see something that you don't like\nyou might try to fix it but when you\nlook in the mirror again another flaw\nbecomes apparent this keeps going on and\non there's something that needs to be\nfixed every time\na desire to fix something about your\nbody is an indicator of poor body image\nperfectionism plays a large role in\nthose with poor relationships with their\nbody\nfor them there's constantly something\nthat needs to be fixed in a study by\nTracy D Wade a lower desired BMI in\nparticipants was associated with higher\nlevels of concern over mistakes and\norganization this perfectionist Behavior\ncan be harmful a constant\ndissatisfaction with certain parts of\nyour physical appearance may lead to the\nrise of certain eating disorders and\nmood disorders\nacknowledge and appreciate your flaws\nthey make you different from others but\nthat's what gives you your individuality\nand uniqueness worries about your weight\nheight muscularity and other physical\nfeatures can affect anybody if you're\ntrans or non-binary navigating body\nimage can be especially difficult\npoor body image is crucial to\nacknowledge and address not addressing\nit can pose risk to harmful outcomes\nsuch as reduce self-esteem and mood\ndisorders and disordered eating if you\nstruggle with the way you perceive your\nbody you could also be inclined to\ndevelop poor eating and exercising\nhabits and this can take a toll on both\nyour physical and mental health\nSociety creates a beauty standard that\nis not fair to so many of us leading to\ndissatisfaction with ourselves even when\nwe are all truly beautiful in our own\nways\ndeconstructing the standard starts with\neveryone being their real authentic\nselves surrounding yourself with real\npeople can help you realize that you\ntruly are not the outlier that you think\nyou are\nbeautiful\nif
