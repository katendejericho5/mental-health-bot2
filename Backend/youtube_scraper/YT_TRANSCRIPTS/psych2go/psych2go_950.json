    "transcript": "hey psych2goers and welcome back\ndepression does not look the same in\neveryone did you know depression can\nlook different in teens\nits manifestation is known to be\ninfluenced by several factors external\nand internal one of them being age the\nAdolescent brain is very plastic that is\nteenagers and adolescents go through a\nhuge developmental period in their\nbrains during this time\nthese changes are also paired with life\nstress unique to adolescence and a brain\nthat is not fully developed this means\nthat some mental health conditions such\nas depression May manifest differently\nin teenagers versus adults but it in no\nway means that they are any less\nsignificant in this video we're going to\nexplore some signs of depression in\nteens so with that said here are 10\nwarning signs of depression in teens\nnumber one more irritability why do some\nteens seem to struggle with their temper\nthe teenage brain is already prone to\nmood swings with so much forming and\nchanging they can have a hard time\nregulating emotions as it is and with\ndepression these mood changes can\nheighten according to an article from\nvery well mind irritability and Defiance\nare much more common in depressed teens\nthan depressed adults this may be\nbecause adults are generally more\nequipped to handle stronger emotions and\nare therefore less prone to acting out\nnumber two\nsensitivity to criticism\ndo you know a teen who avoids taking\nrisks in fear of criticism\nthis may be a result of increased\nsensitivity to criticism which is common\nin teenage depression as reported in a\nstudy by Morin in 2020 it's normal to be\na little nervous about what someone\nmight say however depressed teens may\nfind themselves so afraid that they\navoid doing something they really love\nthough the exact reason isn't clear this\nmay have something to do with the lower\nlevels of self-confidence and self-worth\nthat come along with depression it's\nimportant to notice that teens who find\nthemselves in this spot aren't just lazy\nor insecure there might be something\nmore to the story\nnumber three staying in their rooms a\nlot\ndo you know a teenager who only seems to\ncome out of their room for meals do they\nseem to disappear throughout the day\nthis may be a sign of depression a\ncommon sign of depression and adults and\nteens is social isolation\nfor many teams your rooms are primarily\nwhat you consider to be your space and\nthat tends to be where you isolate\nit's not that you don't want to see\nothers or to be around them but more so\nthat your depression may be forcing you\nto only feel at ease when you're alone\nnumber four selective social withdrawal\ndo you know a team who seems to withdraw\nfrom certain people but not others it\nturns out that depressed teens tend to\nsocially withdraw more selectively than\nadults typically depressed teens might\nhold on to close friendships and\nrelationships and isolate from family\nadults by contrast tend to isolate an\nequal amount from almost all of the\nrelationships in their lives\nnumber five\nthrowing themselves into work do you\nknow a teen who seems to bury themselves\nin school work does it seem like they\nspend a long time working\nthere are multiple reasons for this but\namong other things this could be a sign\nof teenage depression distraction is a\ncommon coping mechanism for depression\nand teens often have a heavy plate of\nwork thus some of you resort to\ntemporarily distracting yourself with\nassignments even those that might not be\ndue anytime soon\nnumber six slipping grades on the flip\nside another common sign of depression\nin teens is that their grades might slip\non the outside this may look like\nlaziness but this could be a sign of\nsomething bigger schoolwork is demanding\nand depression can take a toll on\nsomeone's mental state therefore if a\nteenager's grades are slipping it might\nbe because depression is taking away the\nenergy and motivation for them to do\ntheir best number seven harder time\nfocusing do you or does a teen you know\nseem to have a harder time concentrating\nthan normal\nwith anything from school work to\nHobbies a harder time focusing on\neveryday tasks could be a sign of\nteenage depression\naccording to Smith and others in a study\npublished in 2020 depression can be very\nenergy consuming and as a result many\nteens find it harder and harder to\nconcentrate even on things that would\nnormally capture their attention like\nother signs on this list it's important\nnot to assume laziness if you notice\nthis in yourself or in a teen around you\ndifficulty concentrating could be a sign\nof not only depression but a number of\nmental health issues that are not your\nfault\nnumber eight changes in energy\ndoes a teen close to you appear suddenly\nmore Restless or sluggish\nboth of these changes in energy could be\nsigns of depression\naccording to Stanford Children's Health\nsluggishness in depressed teens shows up\nin their speech reactions and movement\nthe same article explained that\ndepression-related restlessness can look\nlike fidgeting or acting up publicly\na consistent change in energy or out of\ncharacter Behavior could indicate an\nissue beneath the surface number nine\nchanges in Daily habits\ndo you notice different eating or\nsleeping patterns in a team similar to\nadults changes in sleep and appetite are\ncommon signs of teenage depression\nwhether eating and sleeping too much or\ntoo little teens with depression often\nfind themselves taking less care of\ntheir health and well-being\nevery once in a while catching up on\nsleep or not feeling as hungry is\ntotally normal however a consistent\nshift to unhealthy habits could be a\nsign of something larger and number 10\nphysical pains did you know that\ndepressed teens tend to have more\npronounced physical pain than depressed\nadults according to health guide\ndepressed teens tend to be more impacted\nby aches and pains than depressed adults\nthese physical pains can be anywhere in\nthe body and seem spontaneous\nstomach aches headaches and cramping\nthroughout the body are all equally\npossible if you or a teen you know\ncontinues to ache without any other\nphysical condition it could be a\nphysical manifestation of depression\nregardless of age depression is a very\nreal and very serious mental illness\nthat can creep onto you silently\ntherefore it helps to keep an eye out\nfor its snare\nbut you don't have to fight it all on\nyour own don't be afraid to ask for help\nnor let the stigma is attached deter you\nno matter how bad it gets there's always\nhope that things can get better\nreaching out to a psychologist or a\ncounselor and getting the help you need\ncan not only improve your life but also\nencourage others to break away from the\nstigmas to seek help\nwe hope we were able to give you
