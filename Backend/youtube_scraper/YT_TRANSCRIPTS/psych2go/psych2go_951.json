    "transcript": "the problem with saying no is that we\nfind it difficult to say it firmly\nsometimes even if we say no people don't\nbelieve us because of how we say it so\nhere are five steps you can take for\nyour nose to be seen as real boundaries\nnumber one check in with yourself we\ngrew up thinking that helping others is\na selfless act but self-care is not\nselfish checking in with ourselves is\none way we know how we actually feel\nabout any situation assess what you are\ngetting into and see if it aligns with\nwho you are and what you believe in\nknowing what you need and who you are is\nthe key to making the right decisions\nbecause it is only you who knows\nyourself best number two believe in your\nskills and capacity often our yeses are\nthe result of feeling inferior\nself-efficacy a person's belief that\nthey can succeed in their Endeavors\nhelps us build self-confidence this can\nhelp you create goals and know which\ndirection you need to go believing you\nhave the capacity and the skills will\ngive you more confidence in setting\nboundaries when you know your skills\nyou'll be able to stand firm and not be\ndirected to do whatever others want\nnumber three set boundaries fairly a no\nis a no now that you are reminded of\nyour priorities and skills you need to\nstart to set those boundaries without\nexception saying no should apply equally\namong colleagues peers and even family\nputting these boundaries in place fairly\nwill let people know your priorities are\nnon-negotiable not making excuses for\nanyone will gain respect from others and\nlet them know that you are true to your\nboundaries number four offer\nAlternatives if people find it hard to\nsolve their issues without your help\nthen offer alternative Solutions you can\nmaybe give them a timetable or appoint\nanother person to do it for you this\nwill reiterate your boundaries and will\nhelp people realize which favors you can\nand cannot help with number five just do\nit there is no greater practice than to\njust do it you'll never be able to truly\nunderstand your limits and your\npriorities unless you practice it start\nwith the small stuff like saying no to a\nweekend trip with your friends because\nyou're too tired from work then say no\nto your family when they ask you for\nyour time during a very important time\nin your career when you start doing this\nyou'll understand what you truly want\nhow people will react and how you'll\nhandle it better the next time\nboundaries are difficult to create we\nnever want to miss out on anything and\nwe want to impress people and make them\nthink we can do it all but we are only\nhuman and have limits or boundaries that\nkeep us safe and protected it may be\ntempting to say yes to every single\nopportunity or request but the major yes\nshould be to yourself and your\npriorities so remember sometimes saying\nno is the best yes you can give yourself\ncan you relate to any of these points\nlet us know in the comments below also\nfeel free to share this video with\nothers who might benefit from it as\nalways the references used are listed in\nthe description box below until next\ntime friends take care and subscribe to\npsych2go for more great content thanks\nfor watching"
