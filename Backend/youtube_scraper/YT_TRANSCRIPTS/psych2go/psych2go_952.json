    "transcript": "depression isn't always obvious\nas a matter of fact in a lot of cases it\nisn't obvious at all\ni think that we're starting to finally\naccept and understand that mental health\nand physical health are equally\nimportant\nwhat's next is that we understand that\njust the way that we would see care for\nphysical\nillness or injury\nwe should seek support and care for our\nmental health as well put it this way if\nyou broke your arm and\nthe bone was sticking out and it was\nbleeding everywhere you'd most likely go\nto the hospital and get help and support\nyou wouldn't just sit in silence and\ntolerate it i hope\nif you've ever suffered from depression\nthen do you know how real it can get in\nhere it's comparable to the bone\nso if you're suffering please don't do\nit in silence\nseek professional help\nit's available and you deserve it"
