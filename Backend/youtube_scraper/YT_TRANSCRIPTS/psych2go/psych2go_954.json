    "transcript": "hi welcome to ask an expert an interview\nseries where we chat about topics around\nmental health with experts ranging from\nthose with clinical experiences to those\nwith lived expertise\nmy name is monica and i'm a medical\nstudent with interests in psychiatry and\nneuroscience\ni created this series ask an expert to\ngive a platform to those who have live\nextra expertise and also clinical\nexperiences to really share their\nstories\nso if you're interested in being\nfeatured in the next episode of ask an\nexpert then consider to fill out the\nrecruitment form in the description box\nbelow or if you know of a friend or\nfamily member who might want to join you\ncould also afford them the link\ni think it's a really great way to\nreally shed light on important mental\nhealth challenges that are especially\nincreasingly prevalent\nand speaking of really prevalent\nexperiences i've often times heard of\npeople just say that you know their\nattention span is getting shorter and\nshorter with the rise of\nshorts and the rise of tick tock and\nthat they're becoming quite restless or\nimpulsive and that leads me and a couple\nof potentially other people to wonder at\nwhat point does that actually become\nsomething like adhd\nand so i'm really delighted to\ntalk about adhd today with the wonderful\ntracy marks\nwelcome dr marks hey monica yay we're\nhere together\ni am so excited for this i know lots of\npeople from the psych2go community have\nbeen waiting for this to happen so it's\namazing\nthat's great it's amazing\nthanks for inviting me over\nthank you so much for being here um\nshall we start by would you like to\nshare some of your experiences and the\nkind of things that you do\nsure so i'm a psychiatrist\nand i am i work in a private practice my\nown practice in atlanta georgia\nand then since about 2018 i've been\nconsistently producing mental health\neducation content on youtube here under\nmy name dr tracy marks\namazing uh so for any of you who are\ncurious who might not know\nthe channel is going to be linked in the\ndescription box below so do check it out\nthere's amazing content also about all\nsorts of mental health disorders adhd\nwhich is what we're going to dive into\ntoday\nso i thought maybe we can start by just\ndefining what exactly is adhd and at\nwhat point does it become more than just\nbeing distracted\nsure so adhd is listed actually as a\nneurodevelopmental disorder and the\ndiagnostic manual which is the book i\nwish i had one here with me to show you\nbut it's a book that we clinicians use\nto\nestablish or understand what how to\ndiagnose something so you have all of\nthese disorders and a list of criteria\nfor someone to meet to be considered to\nhave that disorder so and they're\ncategorized under mood disorders etc so\nhere neurodevelopmental disorders are\ndisorders that\npredominantly start in childhood and\nthought to be a product of your brain\ndevelopment\nso\nthe reason i mention that is because\nadhd i actually feel very\nyou know i have a personal interest in\nthis disorder as well as a lot of\ncompassion for people who suffer with it\num because it's so easy for people to\nthink that they're\nstupid or just misbehaved um lazy\nand not see it as something legitimate\nand here it is it's actually a brain\ndevelopment problem\nit's a little\nsome people argue that there is an adult\nversion of it and that's still kind of\nup for debate but nonetheless generally\nspeaking the symptoms develop in\nchildhood they may not be severe enough\nsay for you to get treatment but it's\nnot it is more than say trouble paying\nattention because you've got a lot of\nballs in the air a whole lot of stuff\ngoing on\num it really goes a lot deeper than that\nso what kind of things are we thinking\nif we're thinking beyond just the\nproblems focusing\nokay\nso um there's if you can divide it kind\nof into two sections one is\nuh trouble with inattention or trouble\nwith a tension and then the second part\nis hyperactivity impulsivity so that's\nwhere you get the adhd or\nattention hyperactivity\ndeficit disorder some people will just\nshorten it and say adv\nit's the same thing there is no separate\nadd\num it's just termed adhd inattentive\ntype if all if your main symptoms are\ninattention and you don't have the\nhyperactivity which is pretty common not\neveryone's hyperactive\nso\nthe inattentive symptoms can look like\num not um trouble paying attention but\nalso very poor attention to detail you\ncan just completely miss stuff and\nsomeone's like it's right there you\ndidn't see it and it's like you didn't\nsee it it's almost like you're blind to\nit if there's just too much information\nin front of you you may only see one\nthing\num\nlosing things um can't ever find your\nkeys always misplacing stuff that's all\npart of the poor attention to detail\nthen and focus and then also with\nconcentration as far as how it affects\nyour concentration you may have a lot of\ntrouble\num getting motivated to do work and\nstick with it um being easily distracted\nso you sit down and do something and\nthen\nand then you're paying attention to this\nother thing so then as a result of that\nyou can leave a lot of things unfinished\nand then the second half\nthe hyperactivity impulsivity uh\nsymptoms would be\num\nbeing uh like it'll usually this tends\nto you tend to see it more in children\nwith the inability to sit in their seat\nthey can't blurting out stuff in class\nthey just cannot wait to finish for\nsomeone to finish talking before they're\nsaying something\num running around with lots of energy\num fidgetiness in an adult it may look\nmore like\num being able to just kind of not stay\nsettled always kind of messing around\nyou always got to stay busy that kind of\nthing and it's not a good business like\ni got a whole bunch of stuff done it's\nlike i did a little bit over here a\nlittle bit over there\nand the person can even i have some\nadult adhd patients who have the\nhyperactivity component\nand it's almost like you can just feel\nthe energy hitting you when they're\ntalking they're like\nyou know real animated and stuff and\nthat's you know more well beyond what\nyou would expect for someone that age\ni see so you alluded kind of to\nchildhood versus adult adhd\nthe criteria is the same is it but is it\njust the diagnosis process that's a bit\ndifferent then\nyeah so the criteria is the same it's\njust the way that it manifests can look\ndifferent so in children you can get\nmore of the hyperactivity running around\num poor impulse control trouble getting\nin trouble in school\ndiscipline problem that kind of thing\nwhereas the adult um actually there's\nbeen more research showing\nkind of attaching\nemotional disc control to adhd as well\nand that tends to be a more of an adult\nmanifestation as well of having trouble\ncontrolling your emotions\nso there are some people who\nmay be misdiagnosed as having bipolar\ndisorder because their moods are up and\ndown or they're very labile very\nemotional when it's really actually part\nof their\nadhd of trouble being able to contain\nhow they express themselves emotionally\nso you mentioned the process of the\npotential of potential misdiagnosis um\nwith like bipolar are there any other\nthings that are commonly kind of\nconfused with adhd\nyeah so i would say um so there's\nbipolar disorder number one number two\nprobably would be anxiety\num\nand interestingly enough it can get kind\nof complicated so anxiety can interfere\nwith your attention\nso sometimes a person uh can have\ntrouble\nfocusing or staying at a task and it's\nmore because their anxiety makes them\ntoo\nunsettled to be able to just kind of\nhave the thoughts flow so then they may\nstart to question do i have adhd because\ni have trouble focusing\nand then a mistake that can happen then\nis to be put on say a stimulant and i\nknow we'll talk about treatment later\nbut put on a stimulant and then that\njust totally takes their\nanxiety to a whole another level like\nthey're totally\num\nout of control and having more anxiety\nso\num and anxiety and adhd can look\nsomewhat similar not entirely but\nanxiety can certainly interfere with\nyour ability to pay attention and focus\nand concentrate\nso those are probably the two main ones\ni've had some people ask me uh like in\ncomments well you know can you do adhd\nversus autism spectrum\nand you know my thought about that is\nit's not really a versus because it's\nnot it's not as though those two things\nlook so much the same they're both\nneurodevelopmental disorders and that\nautism spectrum is\na problem with slower development in\ncertain parts of your brain\nand a lot of people with autism spectrum\ncan also have adhd but they're two\nseparate illnesses or two separate\ndisorders\nso if someone comes in or someone\nsuspects that they have potentially adhd\nanxiety bipolar you name it what does\nthe diagnosis process look like\nso\nthe diagnosis process process\ni'm copying you i'm going to talk like\nthat process i'm sorry\nthe process i didn't even do that\num can look different depending on what\nyou're trying to get out of it so if you\nwere going to see someone mostly for\ntreatment\nand you're seeing either a pediatrician\nso if you're under 18 more than likely\nthe diagnosis will come from your\npediatrician\nor if you're really advanced it's like a\nchild psychiatrist\num or if you were going to see a\npsychiatrist for treatment\nreally the diagnosis is based on a\nclinical assessment so you know we have\na list of criteria some of which i went\nthrough\nand you listen to the person's story you\nsee when their symptoms started how it\nimpacts their lives\num do they have other things that could\nbe causing inattention let's say if\ntheir main complaint is i'm having\ntrouble focusing and getting my work\ndone you know depression can also be a\nreason you could have trouble focusing\nand getting your work done so you're\neliminating other problems other\ndisorders that could be causing these\nsame symptoms\nand so it's it's a clinical interview\nand you know in in an evaluation by a\nclinician\nif you were trying to get accommodations\nlike for\ncollege or school to be able to get\nextended time for test taking or\nbe allowed to be put in a separate room\nfor testing or extension on his\nassignments\nthey usually they the schools usually\nrequire formal psychological testing so\nin that case you may go through a\nbattery of testing from a psychologist\num that could take several hours and you\nknow they do a write-up and everything\nso\nthat kind of\nextensive evaluation usually is not\nrequired if your only only thing you're\ntrying to get out of it is treatment if\nyou want accommodations it kind of needs\nto be something more formal\nokay so going into more of the\nbig package of potential extra tests\nthat you have to do do some of them\nreally include kind of\nelectrophysiological things or\nwhat kind of things can someone expect\nso i don't i don't do the testing um so\ni don't know exactly i have seen testing\nresults\nand it's more it's a lot of it's i don't\nknow about you know i've never seen\nanyone hooked up\num to do some electrophysiological type\nof assessment it's more answering\nquestions and the and the testing is set\nup in a way that\nwhen you answer these kind of questions\nit shows it's testing this part of your\nbrain and when you do this type of\nexercise or answer this it's showing\nthat you're able to do this or that in\nthis other part of your brain so\npsychological testing is a whole thing\nand psychologists are trained to be able\nto do that kind of testing but it's\nanswering questions it's not\nbeing hooked up with electrodes and\nthings yeah so it would kind of be like\nthe the structured clinical the skid\nright so if someone were to come in they\nwould just be scared\nskidded is that the word excuse\nessentially yeah so if you came to see\nme as a psychiatrist you'd get skidded\neven though i don't use the skin but\nyou'd be asked questions and i would\ndetermine you know what i think your\ndiagnosis is and maybe prescribe maybe\nnot but if you went to see a\npsychologist it would probably be hours\nof answering a whole bunch of questions\nbubble sheets and maybe even doing\ncalculations i mean it's it's all it's\nyeah it's a lot of questions and you're\nyou're writing things down\nand then is this usually done in one\nsingle session or is there kind of\nmultiple kind of things that people can\nexpect before getting that diagnosis\nso if you're doing the psychological\ntesting for um for accommodations type\nthing or just to have it be official\nkind of thing um\nusually it's several hours it doesn't\nhave to be more than one day just kind\nof depends on how much time you got kind\nof thing but i think uh\nsome people probably prefer just kind of\ndo it all in one shot rather than have\nsomeone come back\nokay i see\nso\nnow that let's say\nsomeone has a diagnosis\nwhat's next what can that person expect\nso from a treatment standpoint um\nthe the main\nfirst line treatment meaning the first\nthing that we go to for adults\nare stimulants and those stimulants\nthere's two main ones there's the uh the\num methylphenidate category of\nstimulants ritalin\nopalin\net cetera concerta\nand then there's the\namphetamine group adderall being the\nmost common one byvance another one\nand i will say that for adults the\namphetamine products tend to work better\nor be more potent\num than the methylphenidate products\num some pediatricians may prescribe\nother things like clonidine uh\nespecially if it's a really young child\nit may not as opposed to going straight\nto the stimulants\num and then there are some non-stimulant\nmedications like straterra\nis one i tend to use that as a second\nchoice because the stimulants just work\nbetter and they work quicker the if i\nhave someone say with a lot of anxiety\nor psychosis if you have a psychotic\nillness you should not take stimulants\nit can\ntake your psychosis to the next level so\nwhen you that's usually contraindicated\nor not recommended if you have a\npsychotic illness so that person that\nmight get stratera there's a new kid on\nthe block that's a non-stimulant\ntreatment\nand i'm blanking on the name because\nthis just came out\num that's another option\num and then well i'm antidepressant like\nlow butrin could also be kind of a third\nline because it also increases dopamine\nwhich is one of the main brain chemicals\nthat's affected with adhd as is low\nlevels of dopamine in certain parts of\nthe brain that affect your attention and\nmotivation and all of that\ni see okay and so in terms of that\ndecision-making process of\ndeciding which kind of drugs um to get\nwhich categories you mentioned if there\nare any contraindications are there any\nother factors that you might want to\nconsider um when trying to decide which\nkind of drugs to give a person because\nyou mentioned so many um give you hard\nyeah\nso if someone had because it stimulates\nstimulate you for lack of a better way\nto put it but or kind of like turn the\ndial up on your internal motor if you\nhave any kind of medical problem that\nwould not be good if you had your dial\nturned up like a heart problem or\nsomething or high blood pressure\nthat for those people stimulants may not\nbe a good idea the people with anxiety\nstimulants may not be a good idea some\ncan take them\num so like medical re there can be\nmedical reasons not to take stimulants\nalso and some people just don't tolerate\nthem well um\nyou can make they can make you lose your\nappetite so there are some people\nthey're already thin and not like now\nthey're not eating at all and like bone\nskinny and they don't want to take\nstimulants because of that\num\nso\nanother downside though is that the\nstimulants are habit forming or can be\nmisused by people\nand so they're in the same um dea\ncategory or controlled substance\ncategory as opioids and they're treated\njust as seriously so you have to have\nofficial prescription and you can't get\nrefills you got to get a new script for\neveryone and so it can be a bit of a\nhassle um getting\ngetting stimulants if you if you lose\nyour pills your doctor may not give you\nany more until the next month because of\nthe abuse potential\nand then the last thing is even abuse\naside you can develop a tolerance to\nthem so they stop working then you've\ngot to go up to the next dose and then\nfinally you max out it's like okay well\nwhat do i do now you can't go up any\nhigher\nand then you got to start changing pills\naround so\nit's not a perfect system\num but an advantage of them\nadvantage of them over some like\nsomething like stratera is\nthey work very quickly so you can kind\nof for the person who may not want to\ntake them every single day like you know\ni only need it on days where i have\nmeetings or on on you know before test\ndays or something then you can just kind\nof pick and choose when you want to be\non so to speak\nand the short acting ones tend to last\nabout three to five hours the\nlong-acting ones tend to last more six\nto eight hours nine or ten hours\nso you could say i only want to take it\non saturdays\num\nanother downside and sorry i want to go\ntoo long on this issue but um i even\nhave this experience with uh my son who\num you know some people can crash to\nhave this like crashing feeling after\nthey take them um where you know they\nthey're they're on they're going to move\nand groove in with the work and then the\nthe medicine wears off and it's like\nthey almost feel depressed\nor i've heard people say um\ni feel like i can't speak when i'm on\nthe medicine i'm just not myself and i\nfeel like people can tell\nso\nfor people like that\nsometimes it's just a trial and error\nand unlike antidepressants where you've\ngot to take them every day to see the\neffect or strategy and take it every day\nto see the effect these it's like are\nlike pain pills you take it it works for\na little bit the effect goes away and\nyou're done so it's easy to know is this\na good fit for you\nor if it's not a good fit for you and\nso that kind of makes them easy to be\nthe first choice\nwow okay i've got a couple of follow-up\nquestions so because they're so fast\nacting um\nit's not it's so different from ssris\nright like whereas you have to take it\nand then wait what like six weeks\nsometimes i think that was the mean kind\nof\num\ntime according to like the sardi trial\num\nit just works a few hours is that kind\nof\nyeah i mean you could some people you\ncould see an effect within 15 minutes\neven i mean yeah they're fast acting and\nso\nyou know what what it's going to do or\nwhat it's not going to do and some\npeople will say well\num you know unfortunately\nsome people can kind of get used to this\nlike turn on effect of like i take it\nand oh okay now i know it's working it\nkicked in\nand then because these medicines can you\ncan develop a tolerance after a while\nyou may not get that kicked in feeling\nbut you still may be working more\nefficiently\nand that can make some people\ni think\nlook to take too much of it because\nthey're like waiting for that\nkick in thing\nand i i'll tell my patients i'm like so\npeople who don't have adhd don't have to\nkick anything in they just like get up\nand start working and so ideally that's\nwhat you want to experience that you\ntake it\nyou may feel more focused but you don't\nnecessarily feel like like like an\nengine turned on\num like you would maybe if you drank a\nwhole bunch of caffeine you know you can\ntell when it like kicked in\nbut um\ni went down a rabbit hole would you ask\nme\nno yeah i think that's that's definitely\nit and is this not this is not a long\nterm\nlike solution is it\nso i wish\ni wish we had better options\nactually because of the fact that so i\nhave some some patients adult patients\nwho've been taking them for years\nhave never needed to increase their dose\nand they're usually people who end up\nskipping doses because i usually\nencourage people if you're going on\nvacation\ndon't take adderall so you can sit on by\nthe beach with a cocktail in your hand\nand be on your arrow so you know try and\ntake a break from it to give your mind a\nbreak and then that that slows down the\ntolerance process\num but\num there are people who just you know if\nthey they they can't function that well\nwithout them they may get in a car\naccident because they're not paying\nattention well enough when they're\ndriving and things and that's pretty\nserious so for that person\nwhen they max out\nyou kind of don't we don't have a whole\nlot of other options other than to play\nwhat i call musical pills okay you were\ntaking adderall that you're out of that\none now let's go to vivants okay now\nlet's let's switch over and try concerta\ni mean it's\nso sadly we don't have a lot\nonce you start developing tolerance um\nwe don't have a lot of other options and\nit's easier to develop tolerance when\nyou have to take it every single day\nversus when you can take breaks from it\nright yeah it must be extremely more\ncomplicated with people who experience\nanxiety as you mentioned because at this\npoint it might not be the best\nkind of way forward especially because\nthey're already so anxious um so i don't\nknow for someone who is experiencing\nadhd and anxiety what kind of\nsolutions can they expect yeah so here's\nthe thing um it's almost like you gotta\npick a problem which one are we going to\naddress uh what's the bigger problem\noftentimes with anxiety anxiety is the\nbigger problem and since anxiety can\ninterfere with your focus and attention\nwhat i've found that\nis is that with the person with really\nsevere anxiety we can get the anxiety\nunder control the attention is okay you\nknow it's not perfect they may not be\nable to read a book in a day\nor do other things that people who don't\nhave attention problems can do but\nthey're not like falling behind on their\nwork and they're or they're not\nyou know yeah losing their keys off and\nthey may be losing their keys but they\ncan find them because now we have you\nknow the apple\nuh find me thing you know stuff like\nthat they use things to get by\nbut and they do without the stimulant so\nbut that said\nyes there aren't because\nand adhd can produce anxiety\num you know i've had some patients who\nwe were addressing their anxiety first\nand then it turns out\nit was really the attention all along\nthat was generating all of this anxiety\nand worry and as soon as we addressed\nthe attention problems it's like the\nanxiety just melted away\nso sometimes it it does become a trial\nand error thing\nagain we pick a problem let's go with\nanxiety first let's treat that first and\nwe start there and if we're still having\na lot of problems over here\nlet's focus on this over here first and\nthen see what happens to your anxiety\nso really trying to understand the root\ncause whether it's anxiety whether it's\nadhd\nwhatever mental health condition there\nis and um yeah okay so speaking of\nperhaps addressing anxiety i know that\nyou have recently published a new book\nwhich is very exciting yes yes why am i\nso anxious that i still got a whole\nbunch of\nmy little sticky notes in there\num and uh yeah it just published\nlast month mid-august it's jam-packed\nwith\nsolutions um not only like a bunch of\nwhat what you can do about anxiety but\nwhen to do things about anxiety because\none of the frustrations i've had over\nthe years with treating anxiety\nis um you know i would bring up natural\nsolutions of course usually when people\ncome to see me they're already wanting\nto take medication if i just say oh go\ngo change your diet and come back you'll\nbe good they're like what did i come to\nyou for i could have saw that on the\ninternet\nbut anyway so\nwhat the frustration that i would have\nwould be you know i would say what about\nthis breathing and meditation and people\nsay well i tried that it doesn't work\nnone of that none of that stuff works i\nhear that all the time and then i\nstarted believing that too like this\nstuff doesn't work people need medicine\nthat stuff doesn't work\nwell\nwhat the issue is is that\nnone of the solutions for anxiety work\nfor every part of your anxiety there's\nnot a one-stop-shop solution that's\ngoing to take care of all of your\nsymptoms you gotta\nlayer\nthe solutions\nlayer things\nso what i aim to do in the book is give\npeople a collection of tools that they\ncan use and layer\nto address their anxiety\nfor various situations\nand even someone who ends up needing\nmedication because some people for some\npeople that real that is the answer for\nthem but even so on top of that you can\nstill have your collection of tools in\nyour toolbox\nto be able to use at a time at a point\nwhere maybe you don't need you can get\noff the medication and just rely on your\ntools\nor\nstay on your medication and when things\nstill go up and down you still bring out\nthese tools to manage things\ni'm definitely very keen to have a chat\nabout some of these tools and perhaps\nshare it with the psych2go community so\nwe'd love to have you again\nyeah i'll come back amazing so uh if\nanyone in the psych2go community has any\nparticular questions or is keen to hear\nabout um the book then please leave in\nthe comment section below\notherwise i would like to
