    "transcript": "[Music]\nhey psych2goers welcome back to another\nvideo\nas a quick disclaimer we wanted to\nremind our viewers that the depression\nsigns discussed in this video should not\nbe used to diagnose anyone with\ndepression\nif you or someone you know is struggling\nwith depression please reach out to a\nmental health professional who can help\nwith that said let's begin\nhave you ever had days where all you\nwanted to do is lie in bed and do\nabsolutely nothing else\nyou just wanted to be lazy and not worry\nabout any of your responsibilities\nwe've all had our off days we've all\nfelt lazy unmotivated and uninspired\nfrom time to time and it's normal to\nfeel like that\nbut we live in such a hyper competitive\nsociety that's so hyper focused on\npursuing success and wealth that it's\nmade us feel internally guilty for the\ntime we spend not working towards\nsomething productive\nwhen you overwork yourself to exhaustion\nand are dealing with chronic stress it\nwill inevitably have adverse effects on\nyour mental and emotional health\nbut what if it could be more than that\nwhat if your laziness is more than just\nyou feeling burnt out\nhere are six warning signs of depression\nthat are more than just laziness\nnumber one\nyou can't snap yourself out of it\na sense of laziness usually creeps in\nwhen you're overly stressed or if you've\nbeen working too hard for too long\nand there are a lot of nifty tips and\ntricks you can use to snap yourself out\nof it like making a to-do list listening\nto motivational talks or setting\nachievable goals\nbut when it's depression\ndepression isn't a choice and it's\ndefinitely not something you can just\nshake off or get over\nno matter what other people tell you\ndepression is a serious mental illness\nthat needs to be treated with\nprofessional help and medication if\nrequired\noften times depressive episodes can\nrecur throughout your life so months of\ntherapy may be needed to help you cope\nnumber two\nyou can't cheer yourself up\ndo you often struggle with feelings of\nunexplained loneliness sadness and\nhopelessness\ndo you feel exhausted all the time and\nrarely have any energy\nyou might be feeling downcast and\ndisheartened for reasons you just don't\nunderstand\nand nothing you do seems to cheer you up\nor make you feel better no amount of\nsleep comfort food self-care activities\nor fun times with friends seem to do\nmuch to brighten your spirits\nwhen you're battling depression not even\ndoing the things you used to love the\nmost or spending time with your loved\nones can make you feel better number\nthree you've lost interest in everything\naccording to the american psychological\nassociation a markedly diminished\ninterest of pleasure in activities is\none of the hallmarks of a depressive\nepisode so if you've found that your\nlaziness has made you lose motivation\nand interest in everything including\nschool and work then that's a sure sign\nthat something is seriously wrong with\nyour mental health with depression you\ntend to lose interest in your hobbies\nand emotionally withdraw from those\naround you you prefer to stay at home\nand lay in bed doing nothing most of the\nday because you just can't find it in\nyourself to care enough about much of\nanything anymore\nnumber four\nyou can't function like you used to do\nyou feel that your laziness is getting\nout of hand has it become too much for\nyou to manage\nis it getting in the way of your work\nyour school or your personal life\nif you answered yes to any of these\nquestions then you may be dealing with\ndepression\nin diagnosing depression psychologists\ntend to look at the four d's of\nabnormality\nthey are deviance distress danger and\ndysfunction\nso if your laziness is making you\ndysfunctional significantly interferes\nwith your everyday tasks and feels like\na constant hurdle in your life\nthen it may be time to see a mental\nhealth care professional about it\nnumber five\nyour laziness isn't triggered by\nanything\noftentimes laziness manifests as\nprocrastination and may be brought on by\na number of different reasons\nsome believe a sense of laziness\nreflects the lack of self-esteem while\nothers would argue it's because of a\nlack of positive recognition from others\nit could also be due to a lack of\ndiscipline self-control and interest\nbut what about depression\nwhat brings about depression\nwell the truth is\npsychologists don't really know\nbut one thing we do know for sure is\nthat it isn't usually triggered by just\none particular thing\nthere isn't always a clear reason for\nwhy depression might develop\nso if you find yourself feeling down\ndisheartened and unenergetic all of a\nsudden depression may be the reason why\nand number six\nyour laziness isn't a choice\nfinally but perhaps most importantly the\nkey difference between depression and\nlaziness is that while laziness can be\nchanged depression isn't so easily\naltered\nif you're feeling tired or unmotivated\nyou can do something to change that for\nyourself you can rest brainstorm look\nfor inspiration and try out different\nproductivity hacks to help you get out\nof your funk but with depression it's\nnot that easy\nit's not a funk that you can just get\nout of\nwhen you have depression you're not\nmaking the choice to be depressed or\nstay depressed in fact patients with\ndepression often report feelings of\nextreme\nguilt\nshame and helplessness due to their\ndepression\nno one with depression is ever just\ndoing it for attention\nmental illness goes so much deeper than\nthat\ncan you relate to any of the signs of\ndepression in this video\nif you or anyone you know is\nexperiencing serious feelings of\ndepression don't hesitate to reach out\nto a mental healthcare professional and\nget help\nplease like and share this video if it\nhelped you and you think it could help\nsomeone else
