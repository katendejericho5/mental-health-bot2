    "transcript": "and so attractive how exactly is\nattractiveness defined while it's true a\nlot of the time it's subjective you also\ncan't deny the fact that there just are\nsome people others collectively find\nattractive\nso what is that magic recipe exactly\npsychological studies looking into these\nquestions have so far agreed that\nattractiveness is more than just a\nmatter of physical appearance it also\nhas to do a lot with certain behaviors\nhere are seven things Attractive people\ndo that set them apart from the rest\nnumber one they complement others you\noften say nice things about other people\nhow do you feel when others compliment\nyou words of Praise have a knack for\nmaking their speakers seem more\nattractive and approachable immediately\nyou naturally gravitate towards people\nwho are not shy about complimenting\nthose around them they're not as worried\nabout competition or feel as threatened\nby the attractiveness of others as most\npeople might think and because they're\nquick with a kind word it only ends up\nmaking them look better instead of\nbitter bonus dip did you know that kind\npeople are also Attractive people and\nkind people do kind things for others\nlike complimenting others helping an\nelderly cross the road carrying\nsomeone's bags and hitting the like\nbutton of their favorite YouTube channel\noops yeah that was totally intentional\nif you enjoy sectico's content so far\nlike this video And subscribe to our\nchannel for more content thanks so much\nfor your support number two they make it\na habit to smile does attractiveness\nmake a person seem more standoffish\ncontrary to popular belief studies show\nthat attractive people tend to be\nhappier and friendlier that's why people\nwho make it a habit to smile appear\nincredibly attractive to others they\nlove finding the little joys in life\nthey're usually happy and upbeat which\nis what makes people always want to be\nin their presence their smiles just\nbrighten every room they walk into and\nthey generously share this happiness\nwith others\nnumber three they dress well all the\ntime what's the first thing that comes\nto mind when you think of Attractive\npeople dressing up to the nines right\nbut not for the reasons that you might\nthink\nthey dress well all the time not because\nthey're vain or superficial but because\nthey know it can make a positive\ndifference in a person's life knowing\nhow to dress yourself and having a good\nsense of style that suits you will not\nonly make you more confident and\nnoticeable to others but it'll also make\nyou look smarter and more put together\nvoila number four they pamper themselves\ndo you agree that pampering yourself is\none of the first steps to self-love\nbeing mindful of your grooming leaves a\ngood impression on others so don't be\nsurprised to find a lot of Attractive\npeople hitting up the salon the spa or\nthe gym every so often it's not just\nbecause they care about how they look\nbut more importantly that they want to\ntake good care of themselves which\nbrings us to the next Point number five\nthey set their standards High when it\ncomes to friendships and relationships\nan attractive person seldom sticks\naround if others treat them less than\nthey deserve or repeatedly fail to\nrecognize their value as should everyone\nelse do\nthe way they value themselves adds to\ntheir attractiveness an attractive\nperson knows their worth and they set\ntheir standards accordingly they never\nallow others to take them for granted\nthey are well aware of those who don't\nsee their worth and are extremely averse\nto wasting their time on them such an\nattitude is far from the borders of\narrogance rather it hinges on\nself-respect number six they push\nthemselves to be better\nunfortunately being attractive isn't all\nit's cracked up to be with pretty\nprivilege comes a double-edged sword of\nconstantly being underestimated by\nothers and struggling to be taken\nseriously a lot of the time Attractive\npeople are able to gauge their own\nattractiveness because of how others see\nthem that's why Attractive people will\nalways push themselves to be better they\nprove their naysayers wrong and show\neveryone that there's so much more to\nthem than their looks and number seven\nthey are intentionally positive and this\nright here is the main deal Attractive\npeople are often intentionally positive\nwhat does that mean you may ask well it\nmeans they choose to be happy\nthey put in conscious effort to be\noptimistic and look at the brighter side\nof things even if it isn't always easy\nbecause they know that while outer\nbeauty might turn other people's heads\ninner beauty is what wins hearts in the\nend they know better than anyone that\ngood looks can only take you so far\nultimately what matters are your\nmindsets and positive attitude while it\nis certainly true that beauty is in the\neye of the beholder what sets attracted\npeople apart from the rest is more than\njust their good looks it's really the\nbeauty they possess in their hearts and\ntheir attitudes that make other people\nso drawn to them did you recognize any\nof these signs are there any other signs\nwe missed let us know in the comments\nbelow as always keep an eye on Psy for\nmore psycho content\n[Music]\nthank you"
