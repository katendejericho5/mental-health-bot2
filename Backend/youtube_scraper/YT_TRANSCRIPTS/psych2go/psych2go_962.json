    "transcript": "have you ever wondered how your\nchildhood experiences shape your\npersonality as you grow up\nthis question has been asked by a\npsychologist since the dawn of\npsychology and it's up for debate even\ntoday but when it comes to childhood\ntrauma it's clear that the hardships of\nchildhood make you into the person that\nyou are today emotional or physical\ntrauma can shape the way you think the\nway you behave your personality traits\nand even make you prone to some serious\nmental illnesses so here's how childhood\ntrauma could shape your personality\nnumber one\nyou become a perfectionist\nare you a perfectionist with impossibly\nhigh standards but do you feel like your\nperfectionism is holding you back making\nyou anxious and stressed all the time\naccording to research published this\nyear in the journal of research and\npersonality your childhood trauma may\nhave something to do with it the\nconnection between childhood trauma and\nperfectionism happens when your parents\nset high expectations and demand\neverything to be just perfect\nthey don't accept a b plus you have to\nget an a they don't care if you've\nalready done your homework you have to\nstudy for a few more hours they don't\ncare if you want to be an artist you\nmust go to law school your hobbies are\nnot up to their standards your room is\nnever clean enough you didn't do your\nchores exactly how they like them done\nwere your parents like this\nif so you surely understand the\nexhaustion that comes from never feeling\ngood enough for your parents\nas you try to keep up with their demands\nthis way of thinking becomes a part of\nyou and shapes your personality when you\ngrow up\nif you feel like something isn't perfect\nyou get overwhelmed with anxiety and\nsometimes this can lead to symptoms of\ndepression because you never seem to be\nsatisfied in life\nnumber two\nyou may develop an eating disorder\nsometimes your mental trauma can express\nitself through your body\nseveral studies found a link between\nanorexia or binge eating disorder and\nchildhood emotional trauma\nyou may be especially vulnerable to\ndeveloping an eating disorder if your\nparents focus too much on your body and\nlooks in general\nbut it's not always just about looks for\ntrauma survivors eating disorders may\nbecome a mechanism for coping with\nnegative emotions they experience\nthrough unhealthy eating habits or by\ncontrolling your weight you may feel\nlike you're finally gaining control over\nsomething in your life\nyou may feel like your whole life is out\nof your hands but at least you still\nhave ownership over your body\nyou may also indulge in emotional eating\nthis is when food becomes your best\nfriend and you turn to it when life gets\nyou down\nbut no matter how good it may feel at\nthe moment disordered eating just adds\nto your trauma in the end\nnumber three\nyou sometimes act childish\ndo you sometimes act a little too\nchildish\ntrauma can sometimes make you stuck in\nyour childhood\nall those feelings that you may\nexperience\nshame guilt humiliation fear\npull you back and sometimes make you\nterrified of being an adult\nmaybe you feel like you can't make\ndecisions for yourself or like you're\nnot capable of handling adult stresses\nlike going to work paying the bills\nhandling chores and so on this can make\nyou feel so overwhelmed that you may\nturn to your inner child for help this\nis called age regression and it's a\npsychological defense mechanism where\nyou return to some childlike behaviors\nto help you cope\nthis can include baby talk throwing\ntemper tantrums using stuffed animals to\nself-soothe and so on\nwhile age regression can be a symptom of\nsome serious mental disorders\nsometimes you may temporarily regress in\na response to a stressful event or when\ntriggered by a memory or a traumatic\nevent\nit can be difficult to cope with because\npeople may see you as childish and\nimmature but it's important to remember\nthat you're still capable of living your\nlife to the fullest\nnumber four\nyou develop an insecure attachment\nfinally we can't talk about the effects\nof childhood trauma if we don't mention\nthe attachment theory\naccording to the attachment theory when\nyou were a child your way of thinking\nwas shaped depending on how your parents\ntreated you\nif your parents were loving and caring\nyou learned that you can trust people to\nbe there for you you learned that you\nare someone deserving of love then this\nis called a secure attachment\nbut if your parents ignored you\nneglected you what if they didn't\nrespond to your crying and please for\nhelp\nthen you may have developed an insecure\nattachment that means that now you have\nfeelings of low self-worth you think\nother people are not trustworthy or you\nhave a strong fear of people rejecting\nyou\nthere are three types of insecure\nattachment and each one describes how\ntoday you may feel towards yourself and\nothers\nthe first is anxious or preoccupied\nif your attachment style is anxious you\nmight have low self-worth you feel hurt\nand unlovable or like there's something\nwrong with you\nbut at the same time you crave love and\nattention\nyou're strongly afraid of being\nabandoned and you'd do anything to get\napproval from someone who means a lot to\nyou\nnext is avoidant or dismissive\npeople don't always have a bad\nself-image even if they survive\nchildhood trauma if your attachment\nstyle is avoidant you may see yourself\nas strong and independent but you can't\nsay the same for other people because\nyour parents treated you so poorly you\nmay have decided that people are just\nbad in general so now you don't want to\nbe around anyone\nyou feel like you don't need friends or\na relationship you don't want to share\nyour feelings or be intimate with anyone\nand lastly there's disorganized or\nfearful avoidant most people with this\nattachment style had parents who were\nhot and cold one moment everything was\nfine the next they're showered with\ninsults or they're being yelled at\ndid something similar happen to you\nif so now you're not sure how to react\nand how to behave\nmaybe you do want to be close to others\nbut you're afraid at the same time\nwhat if they start mistreating you out\nof the blue\nwith this attachment style your\nself-image may also be unstable as well\nyou're not sure who you even are let\nalone what to think of yourself\nso\nhow did your childhood experience shape\nyou into who you are today\nhow are you coping with it\nthese examples are just a few out of\nmany many more\nwe'd like to invite you to share your\nexperiences too in the comments down\nbelow\nwe hope that by sharing
