people who flirt\nsubtly or don't flirt at all even though\nthey like the person they're talking to\nso how can you tell if someone is just\nbeing nice and friendly viewing you as a\nfriend or if they have romantic feelings\nfor you here are a few signs to help you\ndecide if they like you or are just\nbeing nice\nnumber one\nthey invite only you out versus they\nonly invite you out with friends\nyou've been talking to this person a\nwhile and you may even call yourself\nfriends but you can't tell if they have\na crush on you or not\nwell do they try to be alone with you\noften or are they only inviting you out\nwith a group of friends\nsomeone may invite you out with friends\nto get to know you more even if they\nlike you but if you've already been\ninvited out with their group multiple\ntimes and they still haven't asked you\nout on a date\nthis could be a sign they only view you\nas a friend on the other hand if they\ntry to be alone with you most of the\ntime and choose to hang out with you\nmore often over their closest friends\nthis could be a sign that they have some\nromantic feelings for you\nnumber two\nthey talk to their friends about you\nversus none of their friends or family\nknow about you\ndo you hear from their friends often\nabout how much they talk about you or do\ntheir friends know nothing of your\nexistence\nwhen meeting their friends try to see\nhow much they know about you and how\nmuch they've been told about you\nthink about it do you go to your friends\nand tell them about your crush\na lot of people do if you're already\nfriends with this person and share the\nsame friends try to see how much their\nfamily knows about you they may just\ntell their family about the person they\nlike too\nnumber three they flirt with you versus\nthey keep it polite and simple\na clear sign someone is attracted to you\nthey flirt they may even tease you\nunless they do that with everyone some\npeople may be too shy to flirt at first\nor simply don't flirt much\nso no flirting doesn't necessarily mean\nthey don't like you but often if they\nkeep your relationship very polite and\nsimple with not even any friendliness\nthis is a common sign they don't like\nyou\naccording to legends if you like this\nvideo and subscribe to this channel your\ncrush will text you within 24 hours\ndon't believe me\nwhy not give it a try leave a comment if\nit works uh we're just kidding maybe\nthey will text you maybe they won't but\nstill it would mean a lot to us\nnumber four they try to get to know you\nversus they keep it casual and friendly\nso what if they don't flirt or maybe\nthey do\nan important question to still ask is do\nthey try to get to know you\nyou'll often want to get to know your\ncrush especially if your feelings are\nbeyond just physical attraction you'll\nwant to know more about their life\npassions hobbies and emotions and you'll\nlikely ask them about their day and\ndiscuss the week with genuine curiosity\nso do you find yourself in deep\nconversations with them where they may\ntry to get to know you more\nor do you only ever engage in small talk\nif they're keeping it casual and\nfriendly with only small talk it's\nlikely they're not into you but are just\nbeing polite\nnumber five they keep their focus on you\nversus they often check their phone and\nlook around when you talk with them are\nthey engaging with you\nactively listening with follow-up\nquestions\nor are they often looking around the\nroom and pulling out their phone\nif you were face-to-face with your crush\nwould you really be multitasking on your\nphone diverting your attention\nor would you be staring into their\ndreamy eyes and listening to what they\nhave to say this one is pretty clear if\nthey don't often give you enough respect\nby paying attention to you when you're\ntalking to them\nthen they likely aren't vying for your\nattention either and number six\nthey try to impress you and look their\nbest versus they don't seem to care one\ncommon sign that someone really likes\nanother person is if they frequently try\nto impress them people often want to\nlook their best in front of their crush\nso does the person you're thinking of\noften try to get your attention by\nshowing you some of their impressive\nqualities do they sometimes brag\nwhile this isn't always a good idea it\ncan often happen when someone is trying\nto get their crush to like them most\ncommonly people try to present their\nbest selves they'll wear their favorite\noutfit when they know they'll see you or\nthey'll make sure to have good hygiene\nin proper manners when they're out with\nyou\nif you notice the opposite from someone\nthen it could be that they're not\nparticularly interested in dating you\nso do you think someone likes you or are\nthey just being nice feel free to share\nwith us in the comments down below they\ncould still want to be your friend\nwhen in doubt it could be worth it
