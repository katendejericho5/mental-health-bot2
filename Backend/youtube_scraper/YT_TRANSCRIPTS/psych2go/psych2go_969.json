many people\nwith depression often feel like they're\njust being lazy on the surface\ndepression and laziness may look similar\nbut it's far from the same we made this\nvideo to remind you that being depressed\ndoes not make you lazy or bad\nso let's delve into sick signs that\nyou're too depressed to do anything\nnumber one\nyou can't snap yourself out of it you\nreally need to snap out of it your best\nfriend said to you one day while she\nvisited you during one of your down\nmoments\ni want to\nbut i just can't you replied to her\nhoping that you would understand how you\ndesperately want to love watching your\nfavorite movies again\ntelling someone to just snap out of it\nsounds extremely invalidating and\nsuggest that someone is actually\ndeciding to suffer from depression\ndepression is never a choice no one\nchooses to experience immobilizing\nlevels of depression if they were given\na choice to stop experiencing it they\nwould choose to stop depression is a\ngrave mental illness that requires\nprofessional treatment\nand in some cases medication\nnumber two\nyou can't cheer yourself up similar to\npoint number one\nhave you ever felt disheartened or\ndowncast however you can't pinpoint\nexactly why you feel that way\nor that nothing you do seems to lift up\nthose heavy feelings in your chest\naccording to a report depression is a\nmental illness that causes extensive and\nlong-lasting effects on your thinking\nemotions perceptions and behaviors\ndepression will cause the sufferer to\nfeel sad about everything as a matter of\nfact it does not necessarily require a\ntrigger such as a difficult event or\nsituation a loss or a change of\ncircumstances for a person to feel\ndepressed\noutwardly we might see that a person's\nlife is totally awesome and amazing they\nwould even admit that this is true\nyet that person still feels dreadful\ninside\nnumber three\nyou've lost interest in everything do\nyou feel that everything in your life is\njust less enjoyable less intriguing less\nimportant less lovable and less\nworthwhile have you felt that it's\ndifficult for you to be motivated feel\npleasure or anticipation\nindeed depression can taint every nook\nand cranny of your life causing\neverything to become less exciting and\nless satisfactory\nthis loss of interest is known as\nanhedonia which means to reduce desire\nand lack of motivation to do\nanything\naccording to a study this symptom can be\nexperienced in varying degrees some\nobtain no pleasure from being in the\npresence of other people or some may\nfeel lonely yet at the same time want to\nisolate themselves\nnumber four\nyou can't function like you used to\ndoes it ever feel so difficult to just\nget yourself out of bed you should\nshower but you think what's the point\nyou go to work but you're unable to\nfocus on the task at hand\nwhen a person experiences grief it may\ntake a while to pass but a person with\nclinical depression is most likely to\nwithdraw from daily activities and stop\ncommunicating with their loved ones\nthe mountain in front of them seems\nharder to climb and it feels difficult\nto jump over the hurdles and challenges\nnumber five your laziness isn't\ntriggered by anything do you find this\nfeeling so lazy and unenergetic to do\nanything perpetuating itself in your\nroutine\nyou prefer to lie around in bed instead\nof doing the laundry\ndid you know that perceived laziness and\ndepression is often not triggered by one\nspecific thing\na depressed person may look lazy due to\napathy and impassiveness\nthey will not care to accomplish a\nparticular goal and sometimes will have\nlearned helplessness however there is\nnot always a lucid and direct reason why\na depressed person may exhibit this\nbehavior of laziness\nnumber six your laziness is not a choice\ni know what i have to do to accomplish\nmy goals\nbut no matter how much my mind ruminates\nand reminds myself about it i never do\nit\ni suppose i'm lazy have you ever\nconfessed such a statement to someone\nyou trust or maybe you may have such a\nthought inside your mind\nlaziness has become a hackney term\nassociated with depression\noften times acts as a character judgment\nreally\nthis does nothing to help comprehend why\nsomeone does not strive and put one's\nbest foot forward to do what they want\nto do or what is expected of them to do\nlaziness is perceived as a problem\nrather than a symptom of a problem\none may miss the red flags that they're\ndepressed and need treatment\nonce the underlying issues are addressed\nyou will be one step closer to healing\ndepression is a complex multi-systemic\ndisease that can appear\nconcomitantly with other psychiatric\nproblems such as anxiety disorder or\nphobia disorders a thorough and holistic\nunderstanding of depression has been\nelusive due to its complexity however\nthere is always light at the end of the\ntunnel depression is highly treatable\neven in the most severe cases\ndepression is usually cyclical and early\ntreatment may hinder or forestall\nrecurrent episodes\nthe truth is no one should hesitate to\nseek professional
