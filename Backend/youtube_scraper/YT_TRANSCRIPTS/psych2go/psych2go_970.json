    "video_title": "Ask An Expert: What is Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder?",
    "transcript": "hi everyone welcome to ask an expert an\ninterview series where we chat about\ntopics around mental health with experts\nranging from clinicians to those with\nlived expertise\nmy name is monica and i'm a medical\nstudent with a special interest in\npsychiatry\nduring my studies i've come across a lot\nof different things that people have\nsaid about obsessive-compulsive disorder\nknown as ocd\nyou've probably heard of it too like ocd\nis all about cleanliness that it's\ncaused by things like stress and that\nthere's no treatments available\nwell today we're going to be separating\nfact from fiction with a licensed\nclinician and ocd specialist nathan\npeterson\nwelcome nathan\nhi\nyeah\nso i'm\nyeah nathan you're welcome\nwould you like to tell us a bit about\nyourself\nfor sure i i feel so honored to be here\ni'm a licensed clinician\ni have a\npractice in texas\ni actually specialize in ocd and anxiety\nand other you know disorders such as\nticks and tourettes as well\nand it's all i do because i love it i\nlove this work so much to share what\nactually ocd is and what the treatment\nis as well because it's it is very\ntreatable and just getting that\ninformation out there is super important\nyeah there's so much\ninformation about ocd a lot of things\nare true and a lot of things are not\nquite true so essentially what we're\ngoing to be doing today is to really\ntackle the most common misconceptions\nabout ocd so to those who are watching\nput some thoughts about what you think\nocd is and in just a moment we'll talk\nexactly about\nwhat is ocd what is the diagnosis like\nand what are some of the symptoms of ocd\nso yeah take a few moments to people\nwatching to type in your thoughts about\nocd and yeah should we just dive in\nactually and talk about what exactly it\nis\nyeah so\nyou've probably seen on tv\nyou know ocd usually is portrayed as\nsomebody who is very cleanly you know\nthey like things to be clean or they\nlike to organize\nand it seems like those are the two\ncategories that are shown\nand so most people go around and they\nmight be thinking oh well i have ocd\nbecause i like things to be clean too\nwhere i like to organize and so i you\nknow i must be ocd\num\nit's really easy to also throw that term\naround as well\ni often when i tell people what i do for\na living they're like oh yeah i totally\nhave ocd i love to organize my shoes the\nright way or i hate it when people do\nthis\nand usually what i find is the person\nthat says oh i i have ocd about this or\ni'm so ocd\nyou usually don't actually have ocd\nit's because ocd is not something that\nsomebody actually wants\nand it's not a happy thing it's it's\nactually a pretty debilitating disorder\nit's actually ranked in the top 10 most\nstabilized debilitating disorders in the\nworld\nand so\nwhen we see it on tv and it looks so\nlike quirky and it looks kind of like\nfun and exciting it really isn't like\nthat at all\nocd oc looks very very different and\ni don't know if you want me to go into\nthat right now or not but\nyeah so in the chat people are\nmentioning terms like obsessions and\ncompulsions um should we have a chat\nabout what exactly those are and because\nthey essentially make up obsessive\ncompulsive disorder right so yeah\nperhaps it might be useful to yeah have\na chat about that totally so what i look\nfor when i'm looking for ocd it tends to\nfollow a pattern so i think of like a\nwheel\nand it starts usually with what's called\nan intrusive thought\nfor most people it's a thought that we\ndon't really want it's going to keep\ncoming back anyway and it can be about\nanything it can be\nand usually what it does is it attacks\nour values so something we actually\nreally really care about so it could be\nabout religion it could be about our\nkids it could be about work it could be\nabout contamination really anything\nand it's usually a threat\nit says you are in danger because of\nthis and that's whatever that thought is\nand so kind of as an example i might use\nthe thought um\nyou know i i had the thought come to my\nbrain that i'm a bad person because i\nimagined myself pushing my child over on\ntheir bike which i know sounds silly\nright\nbut my brain had that thought and then\nit says uh-oh\nthere must be something wrong now you\njust had that thought and it comes up\nwith some meaning to it and because it\nsays oh you're a bad person i can't\nbelieve you do that\nsome anxiety comes from that\nand anxiety is supposed to warn us that\nwe're in danger so if we're feeling\nanxiety we kind of fall for the trap\nthat whoa this must mean something\nreally important\nand so the brain says well okay get rid\nof this anxiety this is what you can do\nyou can do a compulsion\nand compulsions are those things that\npeople do to remove the threat or\nanxiety\nand so those things might be i'm gonna\nrun inside as fast as i can so i don't\npush my child off their bike or i'm\ngoing to pray really quick and ask for\nforgiveness or i'm going to make sure my\nchild's okay\nby asking them certain questions\num\nyou know or confessing\nthat\nwhen people do compulsions they get that\ntemporary relief and their brain says oh\nyou're good this is this is great this\nis what you're supposed to do to stay\nsafe and so they feel good but then what\nhappens is it goes right back to the top\nof that cycle and it says but are you\nsure you're not a bad person are you\nsure you didn't actually want to push\nhim over and it just kind of continues\nthat cycle over and over and over again\nand it's so debilitating for the\nindividual that's going through that\nso the sessions are the things that\npeople are really worried about those\nvalue systems in their life that are\nseem like they're getting destroyed and\nthose compulsions are the things they're\ndoing to make sure their values aren't\ngetting destroyed\nand it's it's very difficult\nyes for sure\nand it sounds like such a stressful\nexperience and that's why i when i read\nonline people are saying like stress can\ncause ocd and that's i think leads to\nthe second myth that we could\npotentially talk about which is kind of\nthe etiology of ocd like what\nare the causes of ocd and do we even\nknow of the causes of\nocd what they are\ntotally so what are you going to do\nas a super great question what we know\nis that\nocd tends to be genetic so we can find\ndown the line somebody has ocd but you\nknow these older generations didn't talk\nabout it very often\nand so it's hard to gain that data but\nthey actually don't even have to have\nocd it can be on the tree\nwhich i call the tree or it can be\nsomeone might have ticks and tourette's\nor they have body dysmorphic disorder or\nthey have hair pulling or skin picking\nand we kind of see just different\npatterns and anxiety is obviously a\nreally big one\num and so what i find is when people are\nolder you know maybe in their teens or\nolder and they're like i just found out\ni have ocd\nwhat we find out is that you actually\nprobably have had ocd\nit just didn't come out maybe until this\nspecific moment\nand so life experiences can play a part\ninto why someone's ocd comes out of the\nblue\nbut it doesn't that isn't the cause for\nit if somebody has ocd they kind of had\nocd\nand so\nyou know having a new child for example\na lot of people realize i have ocd\nthat's a huge value in someone's life i\njust have a new child and i've got to\nmake sure they are safe and they're okay\nand all of a sudden all these symptoms\nstart arising\nand usually what i find is i can look\nback in someone's history and we can\nfind other patterns that they just had\nno idea because like i said all we see\non tv is cleanliness and orderliness and\nif they're not doing that then you know\nwe're not even thinking about ocd\nit actually takes\ni don't want to give the wrong statistic\nbut i know it takes many years for\nsomeone to actually get diagnosed with\nocd correctly because it can be so\nmisunderstood\nand speaking about the whole like\ndiagnosis process of it um people often\nalso read that you can just do some\ntests and then you get oc and that's it\num whereas it's so much more like as we\nalluded to so maybe it'd be a good time\nto also have a chat about what like that\ndiagnosis kind of process is like if\nsomeone suspects that they might have\nocd what are the next steps that they\ncould take especially if they're\nextremely extremely distressed from it\nit's good to give them sort of like a\nan idea of what they can expect to\ntowards treatment\nyeah absolutely you know one of the\nbigger things that i look for\nis\neverybody has intrusive thoughts so\nwhether we really know it or not\neveryone has an intrusive thought and it\ncan be weird things\nthat we're like well that just came out\nof the blue that was kind of a strange\nthought but our brain moves on\nand it says that was strange but then it\nmoves on\nwhen it comes to ocd an individual might\nhave this intrusive thought but their\nbrain doesn't move on\nit says this is valuable\nand it starts interfering in their life\nthat's the second part that i look for\nhow much interference is this having how\nmuch is it on your brain\nand how many behaviors are you doing to\nmake sure\nthat this fear doesn't actually come\ntrue\nand so\nsome people if they're not absolutely\nsure is this ocd is it not i say write\ndown\nsome\non a piece of paper on your phone write\ndown every time this thought comes to\nyour brain\nand it might be a lot\nyou might put a little check mark next\nto that thought every single time it\ncomes up\nwrite down all the things you're trying\nto do to avoid or ask for reassurance um\njust to make sure that you're okay and\nsometimes if they come back and they've\ngot this big list of things\nwe can know pretty quick that this isn't\njust a life experience this is something\nelse\nand\nand it's usually ocd related\nobviously individuals can get in little\nfunks in their life where it's a lot of\nanxiety some trauma moments that have\nhappened\nand they can it can feel like ocd for\nfor a little short amount of time but to\nactually have a diagnosis of ocd\nusually we we see it when someone's\nyounger and it follows when they get\nolder\num not always that way but i have seen\nindividuals who are older who all of a\nsudden like wow have ocd out of the blue\nand um and and it came from a big life\nexperience but they probably had that\ngenetic component with ocd as well\nit's really interesting that you bring\nup this genetic component because like\nmany other psychiatric disorders\nit's more than just\nlike the environment it's more than just\ngenetics entirely it's really that\ninteraction\nand this is actually interesting because\nsomeone in the chat um just asked the\nquestion as well um thank you for your\ndonation also um\nsats asks can ocd actually change your\npersonality\nwhat are your thoughts on that\nthat's a good question\nso\ni think it can\nchange someone's behaviors so it will\nchange the way that you live your life\nwhere you might be not be going out as\noften or you are doing behaviors you\nnever did before\nbecause ocd could be anything it could\nbe\nif i don't\ntap on the wall three times my loved\none's going to pass away\nand so i'm spending\nthe day tapping on the wall to make sure\nmy loved one doesn't doesn't pass\nbut\nthat doesn't actually change personality\nit kind of changes behaviors\ni think it does bring some depression\nwith it because it can feel so\noverwhelming and hopeless that i am\nstuck in this loop and i just cannot get\nout of it\ni think over time it just wears on\npeople because it's so\nintrusive\nin their life and\ni i don't like ocd\ni\nit's one of those things that is\nobviously very treatable it's just\ngetting the right treatment for it\nand since we also brought up the idea of\ntreatment um\nanother myth that we think that could be\nuseful to kind of\ntackle is the idea that ocd is not\ntreatable\nuh it's a myth surprise everyone um\nshould it be a good opportunity for us\nto discuss what treatment might look\nlike in the form of psychological\ntreatments and pharmacological\ntreatments\nyeah totally\nso\nthis is the cool part that ocd actually\nis treatable but here's the catch though\nyou have to do the right treatment\nso the average therapist\nmost likely doesn't know the right\ntreatment and the the treatment for it\nis actually called exposure and response\nprevention\nand it's more than just being a\ntherapist and reading a book about it\nand then trying it out you actually need\na lot of training to do it correctly\nand so\nwhere somebody might have ocd they might\njust go online find the closest\ntherapist to them\nand that therapist is probably going to\ndo talk therapy with you\nthey're going to say let's\nfind out what your traumas are and let's\ngo through your whole past experiences\nlet's figure out why you're worried\nabout this\nand and the person might say like do\nwell do you think i'm a bad person and\nthat therapist will probably say no\nyou're a great person look at this\nyou're a great family person you do\ngreat things for the community and\nyou're great at work and guess what they\nfeel good\nand then they leave the session and\ntheir brain's like oh but am i a bad\nperson\nand it just starts all the way over so\nwe know talk therapy is not the way to\ngo logic doesn't seem to work with ocd\nas much as i wish it would\nand so\nwhen we use the correct treatment\nuh exposure and response prevention we\nactually are doing behaviors that are\ngoing to teach the brain something brand\nnew because right now all it's saying is\nthat you are in danger\nand if you are in danger\nyou you better do a behavior to make\nsure you're safe and what we're doing is\nthe brain is going to say you are in\ndanger and we're going to say okay\nand\nnot do anything about it\nand so we we actually are exposing to\nthe uncertainties\nof\nof life of the fear whatever it could be\nso if it were\ncontamination as an example\nthe treatment actually is i'm going to\ntouch the contaminant on purpose i'm\ngoing to keep it in my hand and i might\nbe putting it around and i might be\nsaying\nthe magic met the magic words are maybe\nmaybe not and i had that my wall up here\nbut\nmaybe maybe not\nwe have to tell the brain we are not\nfiguring this thing out anymore and what\nends up happening is that when the\nthreat says this is dangerous and you\ndidn't give in to it and you said yeah i\ndon't know we'll see let's risk it\nand nothing ends up happening\nthe brain learns and it says you i like\ni you lied to me you said i was in\ndanger and nothing happened\nand once it learns that experience over\nand over and over again\neventually those obsessions start\nslowing down because you've taught it\nsomething different you've said you are\na false signal and i've proved it to you\nand not through logic but through\nexperience\nand so\nwe are moving closer to fears on purpose\nand we're responding differently to them\nand so the more we can do that the the\nbetter\nthe better individuals get and they\ntheir brain just gets stronger\ni kind of think of it as a\nreally cold swimming pool that somebody\njumps into that you probably have that\nexperience or maybe the ocean you jump\nin there and your body is cold and all\nyour brain is saying is get out get out\nget out but if you stayed in long enough\nyou would your brain would learn\nsomething different it would say i know\ni told you this was cold but guess what\nit feels a little bit different now it\nfeels better it feels a little bit\nwarmer but the cool part is the pool's\nthe same temperature\nit's just that we've adapted to it and\nwe've gotten used to it\nand that's kind of what this\ntreatment does is let's get used to the\nfear and almost feel like we're risking\nsomething when really we're not\nand and we people get better\ntheir brain learns to move forward a lot\nquicker from these things\nand do you normally\nkind of\ndo this in conjunction with\nother pharmacological drugs or do you\nthink that um exposure response therapy\nis the primary driver of positive change\nin a person's life\nyeah absolutely i\nwhen i used to work generally with with\nall\ndiagnosis is that a word i\nmedications i was like you know what i\ndon't think medications is a thing that\nyou should probably explore\nbut when it comes to ocd\nit's one of those things that i see\nsomebody\nget onto\nan ssri those are the ones that tend to\nbe the one the ones that work for ocd\num\nand\nhere's the kicker though\nand the informations and research shows\nthat it's often has to be a higher dose\nthan normal\nfor it to actually touch the ocd\nand so but when somebody gets on this\nmedication all of a sudden all these\ntreatment skills that we've planned out\nand like hey you're going to face this\nand you're going to do this and you're\ngoing to do this they come back and\nthey're like\nthat's not hard\nand it's like whoa their brain\nyou know kind of figured it out for them\nbecause this medication helped kind of\njump start their treatment\nobviously not everybody needs to take\nmedication\nfor me someone comes in my office i i do\nthe treatment first let's do it and\nlet's work really really hard and let's\nface these fears and let's respond\ndifferently to them and if you're still\nstruggling and you're working as hard as\nyou can that might be a good indication\nto go ask a psychiatrist or or physician\nif medication is right for you\nbecause a lot of people can do it\nwithout medications as well but we've\nshown that it can help\nones that i that i don't like are kind\nof the benzos the very quick\nyou know take it my anxiety goes away\nbecause that ends up being a compulsion\nand and then people get stuck in that oh\ni can't tolerate this anxiety i better\ngo take this this pill\nand so those are the ones i kind of shy\naway from\nyes that's definitely super interesting\nthat you bring it up for anyone who's\ninterested uh you mentioned selective\nserotonin\ninhibitors ssris\nbenzodiazepines um exposure and result\nand response therapies um so those three\nthings are really interesting and i\nwould definitely recommend people\nwatching this to also do some further\nreading on this the literature on ocd\ntreatments is huge it's very interesting\num\nso that's that with that respect\num there's also a really important\nquestion that came up with the whole\nregard of treatments many people\nunfortunately don't have access to\nreceiving professional support um for\nwhatever reason and they're they're\nsuffering so what are your thoughts on\nwhat they can do in terms of maybe\nreading papers or finding out more\ninformation to\nhelp them through through this challenge\nyeah absolutely i\nso realistically\nto find a real ocd therapist there are\nnot many\nnot many and even in my area there are\nonly a few and we all have waiting lists\nmonths months months\nand so\nand i can only imagine just you know i'm\nhere in the united states but in other\ncountries as well like oh the treatment\nshould try to find good treatment it's\ngoing to be really difficult\none of the things that i did for myself\nis i i started creating a lot of youtube\nvideos about ocd and treatment\nspecifically for those who\ndon't have access\nto say here's all the knowledge that i\nhave i want to push it out to the world\nand actually\nhelp you just jump start your own\ntreatment if that's what you want to do\num\nobviously\nthings like reddit and\nthese other platforms and forums\nlike is going to have people's opinions\nbut getting something from a real\ntherapist is going to make a difference\ni do have\nif i can plug that i do have my online\nprogram that i specifically created for\nthat as well that i thought about what\ndo i do every session with my clients\nand i created the self-directed like\nhere's what we do we're going to track\nsymptoms and we're going to go through i\nthink it's 42 videos little videos that\nin worksheets are just like this is how\nyou do treatment this is how you write\nscripts this is how you do exposures\nthat i created for people to actually\njust learn how to do it\nwho don't have access and even those who\ndo have access to just have that extra\nsupport as well\nand so that that's definitely an option\namazing yes having accessible resources\nis really important and so i definitely\nurge the person who asked the question\nand also to anyone out there really to\nfind a resource that just clicks that's\nsomething that you understand um\nsomething that you can refer back to and\nread and perhaps reach out to maybe\nschool counselors to supportive friends\nbecause it's really like a\ngroup effort when it comes to\nmental health challenges i think\nand with that i thought it'd be\ngood to just summarize some of the myths\nthat we tackled today um and if there\nare any other questions you can leave in\nthe chat for the last few minutes of the\nstream\nbut otherwise\nwe talked about how\nocd is not all about cleanliness it is\nso much more um we mentioned how stress\nis not\nthe only cause of ocd it's not the cause\nof ocd we mentioned genetics playing a\nbig factor environmental factors perhaps\nthe whole gene environment interaction\num ocd is not just a personality trait\nwhen you hear people say things like oh\ni'm so ocd um again it's very complex\npsychiatric disorder um we also tackle\nthe myth that ocd is not treatable um\nit's a myth because we know there are\nseveral treatment options from\npharmacological treatments we mentioned\nssris benzodiazepines not so favorable\nbut that is something out there um the\nthing that's more favorable is the\nexposure and response therapy\num and then finally we mentioned some\nresources that you could also\nvisit such as nathan's very own youtube\nchannel and his special online ocd\nprogram which we'll leave in the link so\num if there's any other questions or\ncomments you can leave in the chat\notherwise please comment what you'd like\nto see next in the series and thank you\nso much for your time thank you nathan\nand thank you to all the psych2goers for\ntuning in\nyeah i appreciate it\nthanks so much\nbye\nokay bye"
