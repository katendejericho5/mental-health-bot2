    "transcript": "hey psych2goers\nour experiences help shape who we are\nbut with those experiences comes baggage\nunconscious patterns and beliefs that\nare sometimes hard to shake off\nespecially if you're not aware of them\nwhen you enter a relationship your\npartner accepts that you have that\nbaggage and you accept that your partner\nalso has their own problems to deal with\ntrouble comes when those unconscious\npatterns or actions are not seen dealt\nwith and are let loose causing harm to\neach other and the relationship with\nthat said here are five ways to\nunintentionally ruin your relationships\nnumber one\nmaking assumptions do you often find\nyourself thinking negatively about your\npartner after they didn't respond the\nway you wanted them to or how they\nusually respond\nyou might be making assumptions\nonce we take a thought or belief as a\nfact we start having negative feelings\nor even negative actions towards our\npartner that could result in friction\nand argument making assumptions about\nthose you care about can be toxic says\nmadison fredericks a licensed\nprofessional counselor in an article for\nsymmetry counseling whenever you catch\nyourself making an assumption or about\nto make one fredericks suggest asking\nyour partner about the facts and their\nperspective clarifying if you still have\ndoubts and owning up to your assumptions\nif you've made them this will clear the\nair and foster more trust and intimacy\nbetween the two of you\nnumber two\nunspoken understandings\nunspoken understandings most often than\nnot are expectations of the future or\nagreements that we think the other\nperson will follow without us saying\nanything\nbut if you do not communicate what you\nexpect or what you want the other person\nto do\nthey will never know the second problem\nis the thought that you can control what\nwill happen\nunfortunately no one can control the\nfuture so to prevent things from going\nsideways as much as possible it's\nimportant to talk to your partner it's\nalso important that you ground your\nexpectations\nexpectations or understandings have a\nvery high chance of not coming true\nwhen this happens it creates negative\nfeelings of unreliability resentment\nanger and dejection in the person that\nhad them in the first place\nthe best expectations are to have none\nat all and to communicate clearly with\nyour partner about your thoughts wants\nand needs number three\nrefusing to apologize\ndo you apologize to your partner or\nothers when you have done something\nwrong that hurt them\naccording to an article in very well\nmind experts say that not apologizing in\na relationship is a way to risk losing\nit\nnot apologizing gives the message that\nyou do not care about the other person\nit could also be that you aren't\napologizing because doing so would make\nyou feel that you're weak or that\nthere's something inherently wrong with\nyou\nbut not apologizing fosters distrust\nanger resentment and weakens the bond in\nthe relationship\napologizing helps repair relationships\nby getting people talking again and\nmakes them feel comfortable with each\nother again\na sincere apology lets people know that\nyou're not proud of what you did and\nwon't be repeating the behavior\napologize sincerely acknowledge the\nother person's feelings accept what you\ndid wrong and what wasn't your fault\ntake responsibility for what you did and\nwork to change it in the future\nnumber four\nrefusing to compromise\nrefusing to compromise can come as a\nresult of past situations in which you\ngive to another person and not get\nanything in return\nbecause you felt that you had given in\nand later did not get anything in return\nyou might feel resentful and hurt\nbut communication is the key to\npreventing resentment and anger when it\ncomes time to compromise the important\nthing is that you both feel heard and\nunderstood\nin turn it will be important that your\npartner feels able to do the same and\nthat you're able to listen to\nif one partner feels like they're being\noverlooked ignored or not being taken\ncare of it can create negative feelings\nthat then manifest into arguments or\nnegative actions communication and full\nexpression are important in order for\nthis not to happen and to promote\nopenness vulnerability and connection\nand number five\nblaming and not looking at your part in\nthings\ndo you find yourself or your partner\nsometimes blaming each other over things\nmore often than not we tend to blame the\nother person and not take responsibility\nfor our own actions due to fear\nbut taking responsibility creates trust\nand dependability\nwhen you take responsibility for your\nbehaviors you demonstrate to your\npartner your willingness to be honest\nand vulnerable which in turn encourages\nyour partner to be open and authentic\nwith you\ntaking responsibility looks like\nself-awareness being able to apologize\naccepting that your actions affect your\npartner\nhaving open communication being willing\nto admit things that are hard on them\nand holding yourself accountable for\nyour own actions and words\nworking through all of these problems\ntakes time and communication it's all\nright if you don't solve them overnight\nin fact some of them can only be solved\nwhen we unlearn behaviors and patterns\nthat don't work for us anymore\nand that can take time\nwhat's important is that you become\naware and start on your journey to a\nbetter relationship with yourself and\nyour partner\ndo you recognize any of these in your\nown relationships or in others\ntell us in the comments and don't forget\nto check out our youtube channel for\nmore about psychology and relationships"
