    "transcript": "ever had someone take your compliment\nthe wrong way there may have been times\nin the past where you thought you were\nbeing nice to someone only for it to\nbackfire and be mistaken for rudeness if\nyou want to avoid the unintended\nconsequences of robbing someone the\nwrong way it's better to carefully\nchoose our words when navigating tricky\nsocial interactions with that said here\nare seven common examples of things we\nthink are polite to say but are actually\nrude you look tired telling someone they\nlook tired may be intended as a gesture\nof concern but it can be received as a\nveiled insult implying that the person\nlooks unwell or unattractive after all\nwho wants to be told they look tired\neven if they're having a rough day\ninstead of pointing out their fatigue\nhow about asking if everything's all\nright that way your genuine concern can\nstill shine through without risking\nunintended offense you've lost weight\nyou look great now remarking on another\nperson's weight can be easily taken the\nwrong way as many people struggle with\nbody image and self-esteem telling\nsomeone they look so much better now\nthat they've lost all that weight can\nhurt their feelings because it\ninadvertently suggests that the person\nwas not attractive or desirable before\nlosing weight a better approach would be\nsimply to say wow you look great or you\nhave a wonderful glow this way you can\nshare your appreciation without\npotentially causing any discomfort or in\nsecurity and you avoid reinforcing any\nharmful societal Norms equating thinness\nwith beauty you're so smart or talented\nfor your age although seemingly a\ncompliment this remark can be subtly\ninsulting because it implies surprise\nand undermines their achievements\ninstead of emphasizing their age it's\nbetter to focus on their skills and\nachievements outright you can say your\nintelligence and skills are truly\nimpressive this way you acknowledge\ntheir capabilities without any hint of\nsurprise or condescension tied to their\nage don't worry you'll find someone we\noften tell this to our single friends\nbecause we hope it'll Comfort them but\nit may just unknowingly make them feel\nworse by creating more pressure for them\nto settle down soon implying that just\nbecause they're single it means they're\nlonely it's more compassionate to\nemphasiz personal growth self-love and\ngenuine connections by saying something\nlike everything will happen at the right\ntime or the best chapters of your life\nare yet to unfold regardless of your\nrelationship status this acknowledges\nthat everyone's journey in the realm of\nrelationships is unique and shifts the\nemphasis more towards internal growth\nand self\nappreciation you're so lucky you don't\nhave to worry about we all have that one\nperson we somewhat Envy because it seems\nlike their life is so easy or they have\nthe things we want\nhowever uttering phrases like this can\ninadvertently dismiss the struggles or\nresponsibilities they have that we might\nnot be aware of so rather than assuming\nthat everything comes so easily to them\nand that their life is Problem free\nwhich is never the case it's more\nthoughtful to say something like I\nreally admire how you handle challenges\nwith Grace and\ndetermination well that's one way to\nlook at it you might think that this is\na polite and non-confrontational way to\ndisagree with someone's opinions or\nideas while still acknowledging them but\nit can easily come across as sarcasm or\nderision so instead of using this\npotentially backhanded response try a\nmore open and respectful approach such\nas saying I appreciate your perspective\nhaving different viewpoints helps us all\nto gain a well-rounded understanding\nthis way you Foster a constructive and\ninclusive conversation that valuing\ntheir input without diminishing their\nstance look at the bright side ever told\nsomeone to look at the bright side when\nthey were going through a tough time\nalthough you probably intended to give\nthem a positive perspective saying\nthings like this can actually invalidate\ntheir feelings and struggles essentially\nit can subtly imply that they\noverreacting or not handling the\nsituation well so the next time someone\nopens up to you about their difficulties\naim to valid they experience rather than\nminimizing it try saying that sounds so\ndifficult I'm really sorry this is\nhappening to you or it totally makes\nsense that you're feeling down is there\nanything I can do to make things better\nmisguided attempts at politeness can\nsometimes lead to backhanded compliments\nor harmful advice so understanding the\npotential negative impact of our words\nis crucial for fostering respectful and\ngenuine communication being mindful of\nhow how Expressions may be perceived by\nothers is key to building stronger more\nempathetic
