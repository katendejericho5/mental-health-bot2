    "transcript": "hey psych2goers thanks for joining us\nfor another video\nhave you experienced any trauma in your\nchildhood i hear you me too\nchildhood trauma is any life-threatening\nscary or violent experience that happens\nto those who are 18 years or younger i\ndon't know about you but i've noticed\nthat it has caused me to approach\ncertain situations differently as an\nadult so let's take a look at how your\nchildhood trauma shapes how you see the\nworld number one\nyou may be a cup half empty type of\nperson\nchildhood trauma can come in all shapes\nsizes and severities\nwhether it involves having a loved one\nlying to you leaving not reciprocating\nlove or literal abuse when these events\nare experienced at such a young age it\ncan potentially impact and shape the way\nyou view future events\ntake the musical annie her parents left\nher at an orphanage at a very young age\non top of that the orphanage owner miss\nhannigan used her and the other orphans\nas free labor\ngrowing up she fantasized about the day\nwhen her parents would come back but it\nnever happened\nanytime someone came to adopt a child\nannie always took it personally\nsince her own parents didn't want her\nand miss hannigan had always put her\ndown\nannie felt like there was something\nwrong with her\nthat no one would ever want her\nif daddy warbucks didn't come into the\npicture when he did it's very possible\nthat annie would have lost all her\noptimism\nafter all the trauma she experienced\ntaught her that she was meant to be and\nshould expect to be treated in that way\nbut is this true\nabsolutely not annie is bright wonderful\nand caring and her parents had passed\naway without any other family to care\nfor her\nthis is an example of how childhood\ntrauma can lead to pessimism later on in\nlife\nnumber two you may feel limited in the\nworld due to your medical conditions\nboth mental and physical childhood\ntrauma unfortunately is a large cause of\nmental illness it can lead to anxiety\ndepression psychosis and even\npost-traumatic stress disorder\nresearchers also found that childhood\ntrauma can lead to physical health\nconditions such as lung disease\ncardiovascular disease arthritis high\nblood pressure and even cancer\nlet's say a childhood event left you\nwith ptsd and anxiety this alone can\nmake you avoid certain events or\nsituations that can cause you panic\nsince gastrointestinal diseases such as\nacid reflux and irritable bowel syndrome\nare commonly associated with anxiety and\nptsd these physical symptoms can also\nend up having a large impact on your\ndaily life\nibs can cause you to cut out many types\nof foods and affect how late you can be\nout which may worsen the pessimism we\ndiscussed in the first point it's\nincredibly important that we keep up\nwith our physical health and our mental\nhealth\ndid you have your physical this year\nthis is your friendly reminder to make\nyour annual doc appointments we got you\nnumber three you feel like no one sticks\naround\ndo you know what your attachment style\nis\ntypically you learn your attachment\nstyle through your relationship with\nyour parents since they're some of the\nfirst people around during early\nchildhood meet sam they have a mom who\nthey believe to have both narcissistic\nand borderline personality disorders the\nmom would shower sam with affection and\npraise when they were getting a's in\nschool and bragged to other parents\nabout how great they are\nhowever if sam did anything without\nconsidering their mom in mind sam would\nbe told that they're selfish and\ninconsiderate due to this inconsistency\nsam may come to believe that they're\nonly loved for what they do and not for\nwho they are\nin adulthood they may require a lot of\nreassurance in their relationships\nbecause of this on and off again type of\nlove they received as a child\nnumber four you feel like you're\nstruggling to function in the world\ni have an amazing friend let's call her\njulia julia has a full-time job two\nteenage daughters goes on adventures is\nalways there for her friends and even\nfinds a way to sneak in a gym session\nwhile still being able to put dinner on\nthe table how she makes time for\nself-care and herself is beyond me\nshe has everything together and a plan\nfor everything me on the other hand i'm\nwhat you might call a hot ass\ni have two jobs but feel like i'm\nstumbling through life nowadays i blur\nthrough the days going from one job to\nthe next and somehow throw chores and\ncooking in i usually end up having to\nskip the workout sesh because i simply\ndon't have time for everything\ni don't know where i put things and i\ncan never remember important details of\neach day this is a form of\ndisorganization and can be learned\nthrough childhood trauma part of my\nchildhood trauma involved an\nauthoritarian parent who always told me\nwhat to do all the time\nas a result i did not develop scheduling\nor prioritizing skills which led to\ndisorganization in adulthood so while\ngood habits and healthy relationships\ncan set you up for a healthy life\nunhealthy and potentially toxic\nqualities and habits you learn in your\nchildhood can also end up growing into a\ntrue problem in adulthood so do you\nrecognize any of these signs in your own\nlife leave an earth globe emoji
