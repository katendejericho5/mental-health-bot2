    "transcript": "hey psych2goers are you having trouble\ndetermining if your crush likes you back\nor maybe you're dating someone but\naren't quite sure if they genuinely like\nyou well there are a few signs that can\nhelp you in determining if they like you\nyou know besides asking them so here are\nsix signs that reveal if they genuinely\nlike you number one they get closer to\nyou than others do you notice they get a\nbit closer to you than your other\nfriends and acquaintances are they\nscooting close into your personal space\nif you're comfortable with this and like\nthem too then it's likely good news\nthere's a design someone likes you\nromantically whether they do this\nintentionally likely or suddenly find\nthemselves being drawn closer to you\nlike a magnet it's a good sign that\nthey're attracted to you number two they\nlift their eyebrows in reaction to you\nsay what yep next time your crush enters\na room and sees you look out for how\nthey react especially watching those\neyebrows I'm talking about a flash\neyebrow flash people and eyebrow flashes\nand unconscious social behavior this is\nwhen someone involuntarily lifts their\neyebrows due to a sudden release of\ndopamine they'll often lift them for a\nfifth of a second or even a few seconds\nbecause they just saw someone they're\nattracted to or desire so ask yourself\nthis do their eyebrows say they're\nexcited to see you or are you standing\nnext to a plate of cupcakes\npancakes\nnumber three they touch you lightly does\nyour crush often touch you lightly or\nbriefly people want to get close to the\npeople that they like and what brings\npeople closer literally touching if\nsomeone you are friends with is now\nthrowing their arm around you or running\ninto your arms for a friendly Embrace\nthey may just be getting closer to you\nas friends but if an acquaintance is\nfinding a reason to get closer to you\nthey may be interested in you\nromantically just make sure you're both\ncomfortable around each other look out\nfor the warning signs of closed off body\nlanguage so if you're at a party and\nsomeone in your group keeps subtly who\nare not so subtly putting their hand on\nyour shoulder innocently bumping into\nyou accidentally or not accidentally or\nfinding other ways to get closer to you\nthey likely like you a tongue twister\nsay that three times likely like you\nlikely like you likely like you number\nfour when you talk to them they give you\ntheir full attention are they giving you\nmore attention than other casual friends\nor acquaintances people can multitask\nit's a thing although according to\npsychologists it's not actually possible\nor helpful multitasking is a pretty\nstressful thing sometimes so if your\nspouse or crush is constantly scanning\ntheir social media feed while talking to\nyou or only having time to talk with you\nduring their last match of Halo they may\nnot be ready to say those three vital\nwords just yet when we love and\ngenuinely like someone we are attentive\nespecially when we need to talk about\nserious topics we enjoy focusing on the\none we love we value their opinion and\nthe things they have to say and first\nand foremost we listen and pay attention\nto your partner not the scoreboard\nnumber five they're displaying open body\nlanguage notice their body language are\nthey closed off or is their body\nlanguage open open body language is a\nfantastic way to tell if someone likes\nyou this doesn't always mean in a\nromantic way but hey if someone likes\nyou enough to be their friend they may\nlike you enough to be more than friends\nif you know what I'm saying nope yes\nokay moving on if someone is sitting in\na relaxed open position or perhaps\ntalking openly with their hands they May\nsubconsciously be showing they like you\nclosed off behaviors such as keeping\nyour arms crossed holding your beverage\nphone or glass in front of your body or\nkeeping your legs crossed body stiff can\nall be signs someone just perhaps isn't\nfeeling it today or worse they aren't\nfeeling you and number six\nthey expose their wrists and neck does\nyour partner often put their hands out\non the table openly or expose their neck\nmore often people tend to open up to\npeople they like and subconsciously show\ntheir weakest spots sound kind of creepy\nbut it's not often when we don't like\nsomeone we may become defensive and\nclose ourselves off with our body\nlanguage but when we use open body\nlanguage we may expose vulnerable parts\nof our body like our neck or wrists to\nshow we trust someone we can look to\nMarilyn Monroe's classic neck tilting\npose for inspiration people may stroke\ntheir necks and tilt their heads in\ninterest to show they like you showing\ntheir hands and not hiding them away in\ntheir pockets leaves another vulnerable\npart of their body their wrists open for\nattack\nso like don't be a mountain lion or\nanything and attack the poor person but\nmaybe ask them out so do you think your\ncrush or date genuinely likes you do you\nlike them well will you ask them out on\na date feel free to share your thoughts\nwith us in the
