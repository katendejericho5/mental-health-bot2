    "transcript": "- [Instructor] Did you know\nthat there are different\ntypes of narcissists?\nWhen we think of a narcissist,\nwe think of someone who is self-absorbed\nand has little to no empathy for others.\nBut that's not all narcissists.\nIn this video we will cover\nfour different types of narcissists.\nThis video is for\neducational purposes only\nand is not a substitute\nfor professional advice.\nWith that said,\nhere are some different\ntypes of narcissists.\nNumber one, the grandiose narcissist.\nHave you ever encountered\na person who is charming,\nself-absorbed, entitled,\naggressive, and authoritarian.\nYou feel that they are\noverly callous, aggressive,\nand think highly of themselves\nwithout trying to put themselves\nin other people's shoes.\nThey're also argumentative\nand wanna win in every altercation\nor in a slight misunderstanding.\nThey are classified as\ngrandiose narcissists.\nThey portray the classical presentation\nof narcissistic personality disorder\naccording to the criteria\nlisted in the Diagnostic\nand Statistical Manual\nof Mental Disorders, DSM.\nThey often seek validation\nfrom outward sources.\nWhen they are in a romantic relationship,\ngrandiose narcissists try to\nobtain power by game playing.\nAs parents they view their\nchildren as a narcissistic supply\nor an extension of themselves\nin order to obtain validation\nfrom other people.\nA grandiose narcissist is extroverted\nand displays overt expressions\nof superiority and entitlement.\nNumber two, the vulnerable narcissist.\nThe vulnerable narcissist is a person\nwho appears unapproachable,\nunfriendly or cold,\nnegative and unassertive.\nA person who is both high in\nneuroticism and self-centered\nwill likely worry about their\nperceived superior status.\nThey thrive on attention and accolades.\nThey tend to give hints at\nhow hard they've been working\nor how much they've achieved.\nYet, look puzzled, and\nperhaps even become astonished\nwhen they receive acknowledgement\nfor their hard work or\nsignificant achievements.\nThey have a self image that is divided\ninto a positive self image\nwith excessive pride,\nand a negative self image\nthat is filled with shame.\nWhen they receive constructive criticism\nand gentle feedback they\nbecome high hyper sensitive.\nReceiving only positive\nfeedback gives them the ability\nto bury the negative\nshame-filled self image.\nWhen these individuals receive feedback\nthey perceive them as an\nattack on their character,\nand this activates powerful feelings\nof self disgust and self\nblame and unavoidable shame.\nVulnerable narcissists\nalso blame other people\nand circumstance for their mistakes.\nThey rarely accept\nresponsibility for their actions.\nNumber three, the communal narcissist.\nHave you ever encountered a person\nthat was kind on the\nsurface but they're mean\nonce you got to know them?\nIf you have, then perhaps\nyou're actually dealing\nwith a communal narcissist.\nOn the surface a communal\nnarcissist emphasizes warmth,\nagreeableness and relatedness.\nThey wanna uphold an image\nof the most trustworthy and\nsupportive person by the public.\nThey try to gain this by portraying\nan image of friendliness and kindness.\nIt's not wrong to actually be kind\nand friendly towards others.\nHowever, the key point here\nis the communal narcissist's\nmotives are grandiosity,\nesteem, entitlement, and power.\nAnd number four, the malignant narcissist.\nNarcissism exists on a spectrum.\nAnd at the extreme end lies\nthe malignant narcissist.\nThis kind of narcissist is\nparanoid, immoral, cruel,\naggressive, and sadistic.\nBy creating chaos and taking people down,\nthey feel pleasure.\nThey may not be necessarily\ngrandiose, extroverted,\nor neurotic, but the characteristics\nthat this kind of narcissist has\nare closely associated with psychopathy,\nthe dark triad and antisocial\npersonality disorder.\nWith the rise of social media\nwe also find the simultaneous\nrise of the label narcissist.\nIt is turned into a buzzword,\ntherefore refrain from labeling\nas it can actually be demonizing.\nOf course when a truly narcissistic person\nreceives an accurate diagnosis\nfrom a licensed professional,\nit will actually be helpful\nas it shes light on their symptoms\nand gives 'em an opportunity\nto access a community of similar people.\nSo that they're on the road to recovery.\nAlso remember narcissism\nexists on a spectrum\nand some of us may have that\nnarcissistic trait in us.\nAnd that's actually all right.\nThe most important point\nhere is to be self-aware\nand to have the drive to\nchange yourself for the better.\nDid you find this video valuable?\nTell us in the comments below.\nPlease like and share it with friends\nthat might find use in this video too.\nMake sure to subscribe to Psych2Go\nand hit the notification\nbell for more content.\nAll the references used are added\nin the description box below.\nThanks for watching.\nAnd we'll see you next time."
