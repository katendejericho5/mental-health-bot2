    "transcript": "- Hey, Psych2Goers, welcome\nback to our channel.\nOur days can be filled with many things.\nYou may have a peaceful\nmorning with your family\nand dog by your side and\nthen an exciting night out\nwith your friends in the evening,\nor maybe you have a good\nbook for your morning\nand an exciting project to\nfinish in the afternoon.\nThese things can make\nour days feel wonderful.\nBut what about the common unhealthy things\nwe tend to do daily?\nAre there any unhealthy habits\nthat tend to pop up daily\nfor many people?\nThere are quite a few.\nHere are six unhealthy things\nyou're likely doing every day.\nNumber one, ruminating\non stressful events.\nDo you ruminate on stressful events\nthat have already happened?\nMaybe you are rehashing old scenario\nthat worried you at the time\nor remembering each\nstressful detail of your day.\nThis could have a negative impact\non your mental wellbeing in the long run.\nAccording to a 2017 study,\npublished in the journal\n\"Behavior and Therapy\",\nrumination is a well-established\nvulnerability factor\nfor depression that may\nexert deleterious effects,\nboth independently and an\ninteraction with stress.\nThe study finding suggests\nthat decreasing rumination\nfollowing stress may help\nalleviate depressed mood.\nSo while it can be easy\nto fall into that state of overthinking\nand analyzing negative\naspects of an event,\nit's best to turn your attention\ntowards something you enjoy\nas soon as you catch yourself drifting off\ninto unhealthy rumination\nin hopes the good thoughts take over.\nNumber two, not taking\ncare of your physical\nor emotional needs.\nIt's important that we take\ncare of ourselves first\nso we can enjoy our days\nto their full potential.\nThis could be a break from work\nto take a warm relaxing bath\nor an art break in your current sketchbook\nor a chill hangout with\nyour friends or family\nwatching a good movie together.\nWe should always focus on our\nmental and physical health\nso we can have the strength\nto achieve any goals\nwe may have for the day.\nIf you don't take care of yourself first,\nyou'll only lose energy\nand become exhausted\nby the time you move onto\nyour next task or assignment.\nNot taking the time for\nyourself and your needs\ncould also lead you down\na path to depression\nand other health problems.\nMake a conscious effort to\nmake yourself a priority,\nbecause you matter too.\nMm, time for a bubble bath.\nNumber three, procrastination.\nAh, good old procrastination.\nI almost forgot about\nyou among other things.\nThis common habit is\nanother topping on our list.\nAre you guilty of procrastination?\nAll you wanna do is sit down\nand finish that art project due tomorrow,\nbut you'd rather binge that\nfavorite TV show of yours.\n\"Just one more episode,\"\nyou tell yourself.\nLies.\nThis is a tough one.\nHow can you help prevent this?\nSmall, but effective choices\nlike putting away any distractions\nand working on the task\nat hand in a quiet place\ncan work wonders.\nThen think baby steps as\nyou complete your work.\nDivide the tasks into\nsmall achievable goals.\nOnce you complete one, you may just gain\na burst of motivation\nto complete the other.\nIt's worth a try.\nNumber four, skipping breakfast.\nHow often do you skip breakfast?\nWe need energy to start our day\nand we can get this much needed energy\nby getting a sufficient\namount of hours of sleep\nand a healthy breakfast each morning.\nIt will boost our metabolism\nand keep our brain alert\nfor the day ahead.\nAt the very least, don't\nskip the toast and jam\nand don't skip that glass of\norange juice each morning.\nOrange you glad I'm\ntelling you about this?\nNo?\nOkay, I'll stop.\nNumber five, arguing\nwith friends and family.\nHow often do you argue with your friends?\nWhat about your siblings?\nA 2007 study in the \"American\nJournal of Psychiatry\"\nfound that males are at a\nhigher risk for depression\nif they have a poor relationship\nwith their siblings.\nSo what topics of argument\nseemed to cause the most problems?\nIn 2012, researchers at\nthe University of Missouri\nfound that teenagers may be at higher risk\nof going through depressive\nsymptoms, anxiety,\nand low self-esteem\nif their frequent arguments\nwith their siblings\nfall into two categories.\nThe topics are violations\nof personal domain\nor conflicts over fairness and equality.\nMU assistant professor\nof psychological science,\nNicole Campione-Barr found that conflicts\nover issues of equality and fairness\nare correlated to greater\ndepression one year later,\naccording to her results.\nSo when it comes to these topics,\nit's best to be fair to\nboth you and your siblings\nand let the argument drop.\nHow about watching a\ngood old movie together\nto patch things up?\nAnd number six, ignoring your\nphysical and mental health.\nDo you pay attention to your physical\nand mental health when you should?\nOur lives can be filled with busy days\nand constant interruptions,\nbut it's best not to ignore your mental\nand physical health.\nThere's taking care of our daily needs,\nbut then there's also recognizing\nwhen something else may be\ngoing on with your physical\nor mental health.\nIf you sense something is\nwrong with your health,\nit's best not to ignore and\nseek out some help or guidance.\nMost of our health problems\nwill arise later than sooner\nif we don't take care of our health now.\nThe National Heart,\nLung and Blood Institute\nrecommends that you get\nyour cholesterol measured\nabout once every five years\nstarting from the age of 20.\nThat's one way you can check\nup on your physical health.\nMental health, as mentioned before,\nknow that it's okay to\ntake breaks when overworked\nor simply just worked.\nIf you feel overwhelmed or emotional,\nexpress yourself by journaling\nor talking to someone.\nIt's always best to seek out help\nwhen you're feeling a bit\nburnt out or stressed,\neven more so if you feel\nsomething pressing is going on.\nIt's okay to ask for\nhelp when you need it.\nIt's probably best not to\nprocrastinate on this one.\nSo how many of these unhealthy\nthings do you do each day?\nFeel free to share with us\nin the comments down below.\nWe hope you
