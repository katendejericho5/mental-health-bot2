    "transcript": "- [Presenter] Hey, Psych2Goers.\nBeing in a relationship could be one of\nthe most fulfilling experiences to have.\nRegardless of how things end,\nthey open up parts of ourselves\nand our hearts that perhaps\nwe didn't dare to explore,\nor didn't think existed.\nBut all relationships\nand feelings have stages\nthat may not be completely\nmature types of love.\nAnd of course, that's okay.\nThere are many kinds of love.\nHere are some ways to understand\nif what your feeling\nis mature or immature.\nNumber one, idealization\nversus acceptance.\nWhen you enter a relationship\nor start liking someone,\neverything feels new and exciting.\nYou love and admire the other\nperson's traits and attributes\nand find it hard to find faults.\nThere's nothing wrong with\nidealizing your partner or crush.\nIt's a natural and necessary\npart of being in love.\nBut the purpose of love\nand relationships is to move\nbeyond the idealization phase.\nBoth of you are supposed to grow\nin understanding and acceptance.\nIn a mature relationship,\nyou both accept each other's faults\nwhile motivating and\nsupporting each other to do\nand be better.\nNumber two, jealousy.\nMany people look down on\njealousy in a relationship.\nWe think of it as an\nunattractive trait in ourselves\nor our partners,\nbut jealousy that is\nhealthy and not obsessive\nmay be an unfulfilled desire.\nIn a relationship,\nthese unexpressed desires\nare not material things.\nThey may be emotional needs that you have.\nSo when you find yourself feeling jealous\nabout something in your relationship,\nfigure out what your\nunfulfilled desire is.\nOnce you figured that\nout, talk to your partner.\nIt's best to talk instead of\nletting your jealousy fester.\nUnresolved jealousy can\ncreate destructive patterns\nor distance.\nRelationships survive\nwhen you both communicate.\nNumber three, stability.\nA mature relationship needs to be stable.\nBoth of you need to be on the same page\nand share the same goals and intentions.\nDuring the early stages of a relationship,\neverything moves fast.\nIt feels passionate and dramatic,\nand red flags and boundaries are ignored.\nBut at this point, neither\nof you fully know each other.\nYou just know the best\nparts of each other.\nAs you get to know,\nunderstand, and mature in love,\nthe dynamics of the relationship shift.\nAs a result, you feel more stable\nin your love that you share.\nAnd number four, support.\nSupport is one way of showing\nsomeone you love them.\nIn the early stages of a relationship,\nthe most support many of\nus can offer is happiness,\na promise to be happy around each other.\nAs the relationship grows, you\nboth open up to each other,\nbecoming more vulnerable with each other.\nEventually you both open up to each other,\nconfiding and supporting one another\nthrough difficult times.\nThe support and understanding\nmotivate both of you\nto endure the adversities\neither of you might face.\nSo, do you think your relationship\nor feelings towards someone\nare more mature or immature?\nOf course, there's no set formula\nfor a long lasting relationship.\nAs long as you're happy\nand fulfilled in your relationship,\ndon't stress too much.\nDid you find this video insightful?\nIf so, don't forget to leave a like\nand a comment about your own experiences,\nand share this video with a friend\nif you think it might help them too.\nSee you next time."
