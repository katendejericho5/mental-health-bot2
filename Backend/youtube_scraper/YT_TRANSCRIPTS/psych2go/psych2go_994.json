    "transcript": "- [Narrator] Hey, Psyc2Goers,\nlet's just be real for a second.\nRelationships are hard.\nIt takes a lot of work\nand a lot of practice to get things right\nin a relationship since\nthey're all different.\nBut are there some universal no-nos\nthat we should be aware of?\nYes, no matter how old, new, strong\nor weak your relationship is,\nthere are many habits we form\nthat can harm a relationship.\nLet's avoid that whole\nminefield all together.\nHere are six habits that\ncan harm any relationship.\nNumber one, not having clear\nand open communication.\nCommunication is arguably one of\nif not the most important\nthing in a relationship.\nIt's not just about talking though,\nit's also about listening and reacting.\nDo you and your partner know\nthat you can come to\neach other with anything?\nDo you both talk about what's going on\nin your personal lives?\nThis is a sign of a strong relationship.\nBut if you're scared to\ntell your partner something\nbecause of their potential reaction,\nor even not telling them something\nbecause you assumed they already know,\nthese are all signs of\npoor communication skills,\nwhich rob the relationship\nof the bonding experience.\nNumber two, projecting your\nfeelings onto your partner.\nTake something as simple as dinner.\nYou maybe had a rough day,\nso you look for a quick\ndinner option like takeout.\nIf your partner asks you\nwhat you wanna do for dinner,\nyou might assume they want you to cook.\nBut in reality,\nyour partner doesn't\nknow how you're feeling.\nAnd you're kind of\nprojecting your thoughts\nand feelings onto your partner\nwhen they really just wanted to know\nwhat's for dinner.\nThinking for your partner\nand assuming can severely\ndamage any relationship.\nNumber three, having boundary issues.\nBoundaries are important in relationships.\nWhen it comes to boundaries,\nyou wanna use the three C's,\nclear, consistent, and communicated.\nLet's say you do an artsy\nhobby and don't like it\nwhen people touch your supplies,\nis the boundary clear?\nIs it all supplies or just paints?\nIs this boundary consistent?\nDo you not want your partner\nto touch the supplies ever\nor is it just whenever\nyou feel upset at them?\nIs the boundary communicated?\nDid you ask them politely\nnot to touch your supplies\nor are you assuming they know?\nOnce a clear, consistent,\nand communicated boundary has been set,\nshow that person you\nrespect and care about them\nby respecting their boundary.\nIf they don't like me touching\ntheir supplies, I won't.\nIf I need supplies for a project,\nI can ask if they would\nmind me using something.\nIf they do, I can get my own.\nNumber four, showing\nlittle to no affection.\nAffection and intimacy\nare incredibly important\nfor our relationship.\nThis doesn't just mean physical.\nThere are many ways to show affection\nand to be intimate.\nSome appreciate acts\nof service, gratitude,\nor a more traditional\nphysical display of affection.\nNo matter what your\npartner's love language is,\nit's very important to show\nthem you care in their way.\nIf your partner's love\nlanguage is act of service,\nmaybe make them a special\nlunch with a cute note\nto take with them instead\nof giving hugs and kisses.\nIf you're giving someone hugs and kisses\nwhen their love language\nisn't personal displays of affection,\nthey will not see this as sweet,\nand instead might see this as annoying\nor crossing a boundary.\nNeed to know how to work with\nyour partner's love language?\nWatch \"Five Ways to Work with\nYour Partner's Love Language.\"\nNumber five, taking your\npartner for granted.\nWhen relationships begin,\nwe all like to put our best foot forward.\nMaybe you keep your room a little cleaner,\nmaybe you cook a little more\nto show off your skills,\nbut as the relationship progresses,\nyou might notice you do all\nthe cooking and cleaning.\nYour partner, they\nreceive all the benefits\nof the work you're doing,\nand they're quick to say\nwhen something isn't done.\nThis is a huge red flag\nthat your partner takes you for granted.\nAnd maybe eventually all\nthose little things you did\nto show them you care are\ndraining and feel required.\nThis is a surefire way\nto suck the happiness\nout of a relationship.\nRelationships should\nalways be give and take,\nwhere you're both contributing\nbased on your personal\ninterests and skills.\nAnd number six, not giving\neach person enough alone time.\nHave you ever heard someone say\nthat you can't pour from an empty cup?\nWhat about you can't love someone else\nunless you learn to love yourself?\nYeah, it's cliche, but the\ncheesy sayings are true.\nWhen you get into a new relationship,\nit feels good to be with someone,\nto have someone to do stuff with,\nand just have someone around.\nBut that can't happen 24/7.\nIn order to be there for your partner,\nyou need to make sure\nyour battery is at 100%.\nThis means making time for your friends,\nand your hobbies,\nalong with making time for\nyour significant other.\nToo much together time can\nmake it easy to get bored\nor tired of someone,\nwhich can ruin any bond.\nDid any of these points sound familiar,\nor maybe you couldn't relate to these,\nbut you might know someone who would.\nIf so, please share this video with others\nwho might benefit.\nLet us know what you learned\nin the comments below.\nThe references and studies used\nare listed in the description.\nAs always, keep your eye on (indistinct)\nfor more \"Psych2Go\" content.\nWanna get more information\nabout what behaviors\ncan ruin a relationship?\nCheck out \"10 Behaviors\nThat Destroy Relationships.\"\nThanks so much for watching,\nand until next time, take care."
