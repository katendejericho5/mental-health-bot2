    "transcript": "are you curious about the psychology of\nlove\nhave you ever wondered about the\ndifferent ways we express and perceive\nlove\nor what the secret is to a long and\nhappy romantic relationship\nyou might have heard of a theory known\nas the color wheel theory of love also\nsometimes known as lee's love styles or\nlove attitudes this theory proposes that\npeople love in different ways which can\nbe categorized into six broad styles of\nlove\nthese categorize our relationship with\nothers along with how we feel and act\ntowards our romantic partners it's also\npossible to have more than one love\nstyle as well as to have your love\nstyles change over time\nso here are the six different love\nstyles and how you can better understand\nyours\nnumber one\neros\npassionate love\nfirst we have eros otherwise known as\nthe passionate love style this entails\nwhat we most often associate with\nromantic love\nthat is deep and intense feelings of\ndesire and attraction\npeople with an eros love style tend to\nfall head over heels in love with our\npartners and feel a strong need to\nexpress their affection physically and\nemotionally\nthey love being in love and they tend to\nbe hopeless romantics too\nso if this sounds like your love style\nyou will most likely enjoy intense\npassionate and highly romantic\nrelationships with others\nnumber two\nmania obsessive love\nnext we have a more extreme and\nunhealthy form of the earlier love style\nmania or obsessive love\nthis love style is characterized by\npossessiveness emotional volatility and\ncodependency people with a manic love\nstyle tend to experience the peaks of\nlove and euphoria but also the extreme\nlows of loneliness and despair depending\non how well and how often their partners\ncan accommodate their needs thus there's\nalso typically a lot of jealousy\ninvolved in their relationship as well\nas a demand for constant reassurance and\ncompanionship\nthree\nludus game playing love\nanother love style negatively associated\nwith relationships success and\nsatisfaction is ludus or game playing\nlove\nas you might have already guessed from\nthe name people with this kind of love\nstyle don't really take their romantic\nrelationship seriously fun-loving and\nflirtatious they prefer to explore a lot\nof romantic prospects at the same time\nnever settling down or looking to commit\nthey're also often emotionally distant\nhedonistic and are the most likely to\nengage in casual flings and hookups\nnumber four pragma practical love\nthe complete opposite of ludus pragma is\nknown as the practical love style\nbecause it typically prioritizes\ncompatibility over chemistry\never the pragmatists people with this\nkind of love style tend to have a strict\nlist of qualities they're looking for in\na partner and refuse to lower their\nstandards for anything else\nthey're always assessing their\nrelationships in their minds with how\nwell it's living up to their ideals and\nwhile that might sound off-putting and\nunromantic to some there's certainly\nsomething to be admired in knowing with\nabsolute certainty what you want and\nwhat you're worth\nnumber five storge\nplatonic love storge\nalso known as the platonic love style is\ncharacterized by a desire for stable\ncommitted and emotionally intimate\nrelationships people with this love\nstyle tend to fall in love gradually\noften with people they've been friends\nwith first we're a strong sense of trust\ncloseness and mutual understanding has\nalready been established they typically\ngo into relationships looking for\nnothing more than good conversations and\ncompanionship\nbecause they value friendship loyalty\nand
