    "transcript": "hey sectors do you feel like you're in a\nlow mood all day all the time\nyou remember the last time you felt\ngenerally energized and happy for a long\nperiod of time\nwhen most of us think of depression we\noften think of major depressive disorder\nwhere depression symptoms occur in\nepisodes ranging from weeks to months\nhowever\ndid you know that depression can persist\nfor longer periods of time where\nsymptoms last over the course of two or\nmore years without any relief at all\nchronic depression is also known as\npersistent depressive disorder or pdd\nand is defined by a continuous depressed\nmood that occurs for at least two years\nin today's video we will address the\nsigns and symptoms of chronic depression\nthere has been a huge decline in mental\nhealth around the world which is why\nwe're so committed to creating more\ncontent than we ever have thanks so much\nfor being a part of our journey number\none\nyou are said to have a depressive\npersonality do you think that you have a\ngenerally depressive pessimistic\npersonality\ndo you or even your close friends or\nfamily say that you have a generally\ndepressed mood\nthose with persistent depressive\ndisorder can be described as having a\ndepressive personality if you have pdd\nyou may experience depression symptoms\nover the course of many years that start\nto feel like the norm for you\nremember that your exhibition of\ndepressive symptoms are not your fault\nat all and that you have little control\nover your personality when enduring pdd\nnumber two you have little relief from\ndepressive symptoms\ndo you feel like your depressive\nsymptoms are persistent and that you\nrarely experience relief from them while\nthose with major depressive disorder may\nfeel normal for long periods of time\nbetween depressive episodes those with\npdd almost always experience an\nunderlying feeling of depression\nregardless of when they endure\ndepressive episodes\nit may be represented as a dark cloud\nthat just won't go away regardless of\nhow bright or sunny your life may seem\nif you never feel complete relief from\nyour symptoms in between depressive\nepisodes for multiple years you may also\nhave persistent depressive disorder\nnumber three you can't recall when you\nfirst became depressed\ndo you experience depression symptoms\nand have trouble recalling when you\nfirst became depressed because the\nsymptoms of pdd are often less severe\nthan those of mdd and usually occur for\na period greater than two years those\nwith pdd often struggle to recall when\ntheir depression even began\nyour depressive symptoms may feel\nembedded as a part of your life due to\nthe chronic mild to moderate depression\nseverity of the disorder as a result\nthere may not be an obvious shift from a\nnormal to depressed state in your life\nthe state of depression itself may feel\nlike the norm to you\nnumber four\nevery day feels like a bad day\ndo you feel like you know the day is\ngonna suck as soon as you wake up you\nmay be living in a depressed mood\nhopeless that your life will ever get\nany better one of the most defining\nsymptoms of pdd is a low sad mood on\nmost days and a persistent feeling of\nsadness or loss of interest in hobbies\nor daily activities\nthose with pdd have little to no relief\nfrom their symptoms and often experience\na lingering sense of depression that\nalmost never allows the day to feel\nenjoyable\nand number five\nyou feel fatigued and unproductive\nover the course of multiple years have\nyou been feeling like you consistently\nhave little energy throughout the day\nyou might even feel unproductive and\nblame yourself for being lazy\ncarrying out tasks you need to do such\nas brushing your teeth getting out of\nbed or going grocery shopping may seem\ninsurmountable\nmustering the energy to overcome these\ntasks can feel impossible\nthose suffering from pdd may experience\nthese symptoms over the course of\nmultiple years and subsequently feel\ncritical of themselves for being unable\nto deal with various tasks\nin addition fatigue from depressive\ndisorders may stem from irregular sleep\npatterns including insomnia and\nhypersomnia\nif you've been experiencing these\nsymptoms for two years or more years on\na daily basis you may have pdd\ncan you relate to the signs listed above\noftentimes pdd goes undetected by mental\nhealth care professionals due to its\nmilder persisting nature which may cause\nthe individual to feel that the symptoms\nare simply a normal part of their life\neven if depressive symptoms of pdd\ngenerally range from mild to moderate\nper official criteria it's still an\nissue that needs to be addressed if you\nthink that you may have pdd regardless\nof the severity of the depression we\nencourage you to seek advice from a\nmental health professional believe it or\nnot it can get better\nif you found this video helpful
