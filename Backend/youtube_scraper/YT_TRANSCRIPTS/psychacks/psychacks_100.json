    "transcript": "boundaries are necessary for\nrelationships but a lot of people\nmisunderstand what boundaries are most\npeople think that a boundary is\nsomething that I tell you don't do this\nanymore and you listen to me my boundary\nis you should not raise your voice to me\nyou're and when you raise your voice to\nme I I say you're violating my boundary\nwhy would you do that right okay so\nthat's not actually how boundaries work\nand we don't want them to work that way\nbecause if they did you're basically\ndivesting yourself of any power and\ncontrol of the situation A boundary is\nreally not about the other person's\nBehavior a boundary is about your\nbehavior namely your behavioral response\nto a a a certain behavior in the other\nperson a boundary could look something\nlike this which is hey you know you're\ngoing to do what you're going to do\nhowever if you choose to raise your\nvoice at me again I will choose to leave\nthis relationship that's it"
