    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nif you punish the truth\nyou're asking to be lied to\nthe title of the episode says it all we\nall exist in relationships we're in\nintimate relationships we're in\nrelationships with our neighbors we're\nin relationships with our governments\nyou can expand and generalize this\nlesson to any level of human interaction\nyou prefer\nnow the thing about people is that\npeople are different\nthey have different values they want\ndifferent things and this is subject to\ncreating conflict in the course of a\nrelationship\nno one really likes conflict and we all\nhave strategies for avoiding it or at\nleast mitigating its effect\nhowever if you are in a relationship\nwith someone\nand you ask them a direct question\nand you are respected enough to be told\nthe truth by the other person\neven if that response is something you\nwould prefer not to hear\neven if it's difficult for you to accept\neven if it's contrary to your own\nself-interest\nit's very important\nnot to punish this other person for\ntheir honesty\nwe don't necessarily have to agree with\nlet alone support this divergent\nperspective however there's a way to\ntolerantly and respectfully disagree\nwith another person that is unlikely to\nbe perceived as punitive\nif we respond with yelling and screaming\nwith\nwithdrawing affection and intimacy\nwith ostracizing them from the community\nat large\nthe fact of the matter is that person\nwill never make that mistake again\nyou will probably never hear the\nunvarnished truth from that person ever\nagain as long as you live\nand that's because expecting other\npeople to be honest irrespective\nof the social financial or relational\ncosts associated with honesty\nis asking too much of people\npeople are not saints\nso they're not entirely good and\nvirtuous and most people do not have a\ncomprehensively extrapolated personal\nethic\nso they're not necessarily consistently\nmoral\nit's very easy to say how other people\nshould behave but that's just not how\npeople are\nif you punish them for telling you the\ntruth\nthe vast majority of people will never\nmake that mistake again\na minority of folks will choose honesty\ndespite the consequences and we can\nappropriately admire these individuals\nbut the majority will not\nand shaming or blaming this majority\nwill do nothing to change this behavior\nso what's this got to do with us\nwell\nif we punish a truth that we don't want\nto hear\nthen we won't ever be able to fully\ntrust the other person from that moment\nforward\nany given question will potentially put\nthem in a position\nwhere they will feel forced to choose\nbetween their integrity and their\nrelationship\nor their integrity and their livelihood\nand that's a liability for us\nbecause it creates the possibility of\nbuilding upon a fabricated or illusory\nfoundation with that person\na good rule of thumb is if you can't or\nwon't tolerate the answer\ndon't ask the question\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
