    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe three goals of human interaction\nnow i'm taking this concept from marsha\nlinehan who expands upon it in her\ndialectical behavior therapy skills\nworkbook\ni love dbt you're unlikely to encounter\na more comprehensively elaborated system\nof healing anywhere i have a lot of\nrespect for dr linehan and what she's\nbeen able to create\nand in her module on interpersonal\neffectiveness she talks about how there\nare really only three goals that we can\nhave when we enter into any human\ninteraction\nnow ideally we achieve all three of\nthese goals in the course of the\ninteraction\nhowever lenny linehan points out that\nsometimes that's not practically\npossible\nsometimes it's necessary for us to\nprioritize one of these goals above the\nother two but that we can and should do\nthis consciously and intentionally\nso what are these three goals in so many\nwords they are effectiveness\nharmony\nand self-respect effectiveness harmony\nand self-respect\nand to elaborate how these three differ\nfrom one another i'm going to provide\nsome extreme examples in which one goal\nis prioritized far above the other two\nso if i were to prioritize effectiveness\nabove harmony and self-respect\nthen i'm prioritizing getting what i\nwant\ni don't care if you don't like me i.e\ni'm de-prioritizing harmony and i don't\ncare if i have to beg or grovel to get\nit i.e i'm de-prioritizing self-respect\nwhat is most important to me in this\nmoment is that the thing gets done\nit's not important how you think about\nme\nor how i think about myself afterwards\nobtaining the desired good is paramount\non the other hand if i were to\nprioritize harmony above effectiveness\nand self-respect then i'm prioritizing\nthe continuation of the relationship\nabove all things\nno matter what happens it's most\nimportant to me\nthat you continue to feel positively\nabout me when this interaction is over\nthis means that i'm potentially going to\ngo along with things that i don't think\nwill work i.e i'm de-prioritizing\neffectiveness\nor with things that i even find\ndistasteful or degrading i.e i'm\nde-prioritizing self-respect\nit's not important if i fail\nor how i think about myself afterwards\nas long as we're together i'll be all\nright\nand finally if i were to prioritize\nself-respect above effectiveness and\nharmony then i'm prioritizing\nbeing able to live with myself when this\ninteraction is over\ni need to stand up for myself and for\nwhat i believe to be right\nthis means that i'm willing to fight a\nlosing battle i.e i'm de-prioritizing\neffectiveness\nand that i'm willing to bear your hatred\nor animosity i.e i'm de-prioritizing\nharmony\nthe issue is bigger than me and this\nrelationship and if necessary i'm\nwilling to die on this hill\nso those are the three goals and my\nexamples though somewhat extreme should\nhave been common enough in the economy\nof human interactions to be recognizable\nto you\nnow like i said in most cases we should\ngenerally be able to get what we want\nand feel good about ourselves\nand ensure the continuation of our\nrelationships it's not always possible\nbut it's generally possible\nlike most problems however issues\npresent themselves when folks are too\nrigid or inflexible about implementing\none strategy over another it's not like\none of these strategies is inherently\nbetter than the others\nbut if all you have is say self-respect\nyou're probably gonna be a tough person\nto get along with to be honest\nand if all you have is harmony then you\nmight end up quietly resentful over all\nthe potentially needless sacrifices\nyou've made to make other people happy\ncatch my drift\nflexibility is key\nhopefully this helps please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
