    "transcript": "in my recent episode how to be\nextraordinary in life\nfxtr dr4\nexpressed that while these were noble\nsentiments that's a recipe for being\ntaken advantage of\nand i would have to respectfully\ndisagree i don't believe that it is\npossible to take advantage of true\nhumility\nnow if someone is acting humble because\nthey believe it will help them get what\nthey want or keep them safe or to\nachieve some other desired end\nthey would be wrong\nin many cases\nin in which case they might be taken\nadvantage of because they were operating\nunder a covert contract they believed\nthat by giving or foregoing in a certain\nmanner they would have\nthe right to enjoy certain outcomes and\nthat's not necessarily true\ntrue humility however is a gift that is\ngiven spontaneously expects nothing in\nreturn and therefore cannot be taken\nadvantage of"
