    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe two kinds of dates let's get right\nto it there are only two kinds of dates\nladies and gentlemen there are\ngood dates and there are\npractice for good dates\ngood dates are self-explanatory so let's\ntake a look at the other category\nit's not exactly fair or even accurate\nto consider any date that doesn't lead\nto connection sex or a relationship as a\nfailure\nand if you approach dating with this\nmindset you're very quickly going to get\nburnt out\nmost first dates will not lead to second\ndates so being able to reframe anything\nthat doesn't lead to a second date as a\nlearning experience will help prevent\nyou from becoming angry disappointed and\ndemoralized\nhere's another thing to consider\ni've occasionally worked with folks who\nhave been very reluctant to even go out\non a first date with someone when for\nwhatever reason they don't believe\nthere's any possibility that it could\nlead to a long-term relationship\nnow how these folks even know this to be\ntrue before meeting the other person is\noften a mystery to me but i suppose they\nhave their reasons\nthat said this attitude is problematic\nfor\nthe following reason\nif you only go out with people who you\nbelieve are strong fits for a long-term\nrelationship or with people you are\nextremely attracted to\n[Music]\nyou're just not going to go out on many\ndates\nand this is going to make you\nrusty\nthe ability to have interesting\nconversations the ability to flirt the\nability to seduce these are skills\ni mean i don't care how hot or rich or\nawesome you are\nthese things generally don't come\nnaturally to folks like any other skills\nthey require practice to hone an effort\nto maintain\nand if you're not going out on a lot of\ndates to keep these skills sharp well\nwhat's going to happen when the perfect\nguy or the perfect girl suddenly sits\ndown next to you at the bar\nor you actually match with each other on\nthe app\nyou might blow that chance because you\nhaven't kept a hand in the game now i'm\nnot advocating that you go out with\npeople that you have zero attraction to\nbut dating regularly helps you get\nbetter at dating\nand reduces the likelihood that\nyou'll blow a good chance when you get\none those opportunities they don't come\naround every day so it's important to be\nready for them when they do present\nthemselves so get out there and get some\npractice\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations thanks for\nlistening"
