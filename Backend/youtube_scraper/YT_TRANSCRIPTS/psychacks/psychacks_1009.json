    "transcript": "in one of my recent shorts in which i\nheld that a man can still be physically\nattracted to a woman when there's\nsomething off about her character\nsuperkind asks how does this apply to\nother cultures\nshe seems to make the argument that in\nother cultures\nlooks are not as important especially\nbecause looks may not be accessible to\nmen\nas she says which i assume means like in\ncertain middle eastern countries where a\nwoman's appearance is\nvery socially mandated or regulated and\nmy response to that is yes there are\nsome cultural differences that exist\nin this i would say that in the east\nwhile love marriages\noccur today they happen with still much\nless frequency than they do in the west\nand that marriages in the east\nare more\ntraditional and utilitarian\nwhich may not necessarily be a bad thing\nand there's also a tradition of\npolygamy and also open mistresses so\nthat's also something to consider"
