    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe truth about unconditional love\nnow it's possible to argue for the\nexistence of unconditional love from a\nspiritual perspective\nthis perspective basically maintains\nthat the love we feel and express for\nothers\nis really an attribute of the divine\nbeing channeled through us and that as\nan expression of the divine this love is\npure and unconditional and this is a\nreasonable argument if you adopt that\nlens\nthat said\neven assuming that such a perspective is\ntrue even assuming that love is\nunconditional\nthe fact of the matter is\nthat\nrelationships are not relationships are\nconditional\nand it's a good thing that relationships\nare conditional\nbecause how much worse\ndo people behave\nif they believe that there is no\naccountability for their actions\nfrom a historical perspective the\ngreatest abuses have always originated\nfrom institutions that were protected\nfrom experiencing the negative\nconsequences of their actions like\nabsolute monarchies and papal states and\ncorporate monopolies\npeople\nare people\nand this degree of immunity\ntends to corrupt their nature\nall of the things being equal\ni mean would you counsel a woman to stay\nwith a husband who beat her senseless\nevery day\nor a man to stay with a woman who\nconstantly berated him in private\nthat's a tough sell guys\nand i'm aware that i just released an\nepisode about commitment\nwhich discussed how we've undermined the\nnature of commitment in modern society\nthat said there has to be grounds to\nseparate there has to be grounds for\ndivorce\nbecause if such grounds didn't exist\nrelationships would go to some pretty\ndark places\nin such cases it may be necessary to\nlove\nfrom a distance\nthat said marsha linehan the creator of\ndialectical behavior therapy said that\nlove\ncan be\nunjustified\nthat is she held that people can\nmaintain positive feelings for certain\nindividuals that are not appropriate to\nthe circumstances\nif someone is abusive\nif someone has abandoned us if someone\nhas betrayed us\nthen according to linehan\nthe love that we feel for this person\nmay be unjustified\nand she counsels bringing that emotion\ninto greater alignment with reality\nit's important to understand this\nprinciple because people are otherwise\nsubject to getting trapped in really\nnasty relationships by their own beliefs\ntheir beliefs about the unconditionality\nof love\nso i think that we\nin modern society have tend to break\ncommitments\nmore readily than we should\nbut we do need to have a mechanism by\nwhich\nreasonably abusive and disrespectful\nrelationships can be dissolved\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
