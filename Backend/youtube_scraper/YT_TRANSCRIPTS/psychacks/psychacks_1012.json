    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe truth about commitment\nthis is an ugly truth as it's one of the\nfactors that's primarily responsible for\nthe sorry state of modern dating\nit's not exactly that commitment no\nlonger exists\nhowever\nif you objectively examine our culture's\nstandards for romantic relationships\nthese do not even approach the idea of\ncommitment in any reasonable capacity\nit comes down to this\nif you are committed up until the point\nthat you are not\nyou are never committed to begin with\nlike benedict arnold was committed to\nthe americans up until the point that he\nwas committed to the british\nand we don't really hold him up as a\nparagon of loyalty and commitment do we\non the other hand we say that he was a\ntraitor\neven though he was loyal to the causes\nhe fought for while he was fighting for\nthem\nthe vast majority of us are in at-will\nrelationships that can be ended at any\ntime without any real consequences\neven our most committed relationship the\ninstitution of marriage is an at-will\nrelationship that can be broken at any\ntime\nunilaterally by either one of the\nparties for no fault of the other\nand can come not only with no negative\nconsequences but often with significant\nbenefits\nto the party who breaks the agreement\nand this is the outcome that occurs more\nthan half of the time\nto my mind the commitment that i just\ndescribed\nis not worth the paper that it's printed\non\nif anything it's a liability because it\ngives people the illusion of security\nthe illusion of commitment that's just\nnot supported by the reality of the\nagreement\nso the vast majority of quote unquote\ncommitted relationships in my opinion\naren't actually committed\nbecause they can be broken at will at\nany time unilaterally by one party with\nno consequence\nso if people are committed until they're\nbored or until their feelings change or\nuntil they find a better option\ni mean let's call a spade a spade that's\nnot commitment that's opportunism\nand we would all probably be better off\nif we had the moral integrity\nnot to masquerade the one for the other\nokay so does that mean that commitment\ndoesn't exist in the modern age no it\ndoesn't mean that but if you're\nsearching for commitment in the verbal\nor written agreement between two people\nyou're barking up the wrong tree\nas i've already said those agreements\nare not real commitments\nthe real commitment that continues to\nexist today\nis a promise with yourself\npotentially before a higher power\nto behave in a certain way\nthis is the decision to abide by a\ncertain standard of conduct that is\nvoluntarily embraced and continuously\nrenewed by the person in question\nwhile rare this commitment does still\nexist in fact it's the spiritual core of\nmarriage\nwhich is a solemn vow of the individual\nnot to someone else but before god\nit has little to do\nwith the contracts and agreements that\npeople make with each other which are\nbroken every day of the week\nso if you're looking for a commitment\nit's better to look inside yourself\nthan to look to the other\nthe other person can declare their love\nfrom the rooftops and give you a ring\nand sign the papers\nand none of those things is actually a\nreasonable guarantee that that person\nwill be there a year from now\nwhen circumstances might be different\nthat might sound jaded but just look\naround\nif we're going to have any semblance of\ntrust and sanity we need to open our\neyes and accept the reality of our\ninstitutions\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
