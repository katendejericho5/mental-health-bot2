    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe balance of pain and pleasure\nlook one of the most absolutely\ninfuriating aspects of being alive is\nthe asymmetry between pleasure and pain\nand this asymmetry manifests itself in\nseveral different ways for instance\nthere are so many different flavors of\npain and suffering there are species of\nanger and despair and envy and guilt and\nloneliness and dementia and disease and\ncruelty and injustice they vastly\noutnumber the number of different\nflavors of pleasure and contentment\nwhat's more painful experiences seem to\nbe more painful\nthan pleasurable experiences are\npleasurable and this is really important\nto closely examine if you are trying to\nwin the game of hedonism which is to\nmaximize pleasure and minimize pain\nthe game is rigged because it's not a\none-to-one ratio it's not like if you\nhave one pleasant experience and one\npainful experience that you've somehow\nbroken even\nbecause the negative experience is\nlikely to be more negative and the\npositive experience is positive\nso an even balance of positive and\nnegative experiences is actually a net\nnegative\nthe house is winning at this point and\nthat's why the game of hedonism is\nactually so very hard to win\nand this has been corroborated by\nscientific research into relationships\nas well for example john gottman the\npsychologist who runs the love lab in\nseattle has closely examined the micro\ninteractions between couples and has\nderived some very robust conclusions\nabout what causes a relationship to\nflourish and what causes a relationship\nto fail\ngottman has identified what he calls the\nmagic ratio of positive to negative\ninteractions with respect to successful\nrelationships\naccording to his research for a\nrelationship to succeed there has to be\nat least\nat least\nfive\npositive interactions for every one\nnegative interaction at minimum five to\none\nso this is something to keep in mind\nwith respect to your various\nrelationships it's not enough\nthat the positives balance the negatives\non the contrary if that were the case\nyou're probably going to be miserable\nrather we need to have at least\nfive positive interactions for every one\nnegative interaction in order to\nexperience that relationship to be a net\nbenefit at all\nand this conclusion lends itself to a\nobvious deduction namely\nif you want to improve your overall\nhappiness or the quality of your\nrelationships\nrather than try to increase the number\nof positive interactions it's much more\nefficient and effective to reduce the\nnumber of negative interactions if\npossible\nbecause of the asymmetricality of the\nratio involved you get way more bang for\nyour buck by mitigating the negative\nthan attempting to augment the positive\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
