    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nbe careful about asking for advice\nso I learned this lesson the hard way\nthere was a time in my life several\nyears ago when I was feeling very\nconfused and uncertain and so I went to\nsome of the mentors in my community and\nasked them what I should do and because\nI was so panicked and desperate in that\nmoment I ended up asking the advice of a\nlot of people maybe 10 people in total\nand this was a problem because lo and\nbehold when I asked 10 people for advice\nI received 10 different responses to\nmake matters worse some of those\nresponses were mutually exclusive I mean\nintelligent folks that I respected gave\nme completely contradictory Direction\nand this just added to my trouble\nbecause now even if I were to follow the\nadvice of one of these folks the other\nnine are going to look at what I\nultimately do and think what the hell\nI sat down with Orion I listened to his\ntroubles I went out of my way to give\nhim advice that he asked me for and he\nstill didn't follow it\nthose folks are understandably going to\nbe less disposed to help me out in the\nfuture because they saw how I treated\ntheir advice in the past\nand this was really my fault I got\nmyself into a situation where I could\nnot fail to disobey some of the advice\nthat I was given because I just asked so\nmany folks for help\nso the lesson here is that you need to\nbe very careful about asking for advice\nyou should only ask advice from people\nwho already have what you want or who\nalready know how to do what you want to\nbe able to do\nand you should limit the amount of\npeople from whom you ask advice to avoid\nthe situation that I found myself in\nand finally you should avoid the\nquestion what should I do entirely\na much better question to ask these\nfolks is what would you do if you were\nin my situation\nthis is an excellent question for two\nreasons in the first place to the extent\nthat they can empathically put\nthemselves inside of your circumstances\nthey're going to give a response that\nreflects their own self-interest and\noftentimes what people would do in their\nown self-interest\ndoesn't exactly align with how they\nbelieve other people should behave\nfor instance a dirty secret of the\nmedical profession is that most\noncologists would not undergo\nchemotherapy if they had cancer\nthemselves\nso it's also a great question to ask\nyour doctor\nand in the second place by asking what\nwould you do if you were in my situation\nyou're not bound as rigidly to follow\nthe advice as you might have been if you\nhad asked what should I do\nthe response here won't be an explicit\ndirection to you personally so it gives\nyou some space to accept it or not as a\nsuggestion\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation or provide a donation see\nthe about tab for more information\nthanks for listening"
