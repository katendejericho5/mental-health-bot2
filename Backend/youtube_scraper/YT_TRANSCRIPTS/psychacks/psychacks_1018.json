    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to handle failure like a pro\nlook if you're going to be great\nyou have to be willing to fail\nthink of the greatest basketball players\nof all time michael jordan kobe bryant\nlebron james\nnow think of how many games those guys\nlost\ntogether they've lost more games than\nmost professional players will ever win\nover their entire careers\njust by virtue of the fact that they've\nbeen so great for so long\neven the all-time leaders in major\nleague baseball have a career batting\naverage of less than 400 which means\nthat the very best hitters in the\nhistory of that sport failed to get a\nhit more times than they succeeded\nso the path to mastery requires passing\nthrough not just failure\nbut a great deal of failure\ntherefore in order to be great\nthe ability to come to some sort of\nemotional acceptance with respect to the\ninevitability of failure is essential\nand i think professional athletes\nactually have a very good attitude with\nrespect to failure that's worth\nemulating\nwhat happens after lebron loses a game\nhe's in front of the reporters at the\npress conference and he'll say something\nlike yeah we weren't passing very well\nand you know we're missing our free\nthrows which obviously we can't do the\nother team played really well they\nshowed some good hustle\nbut right now we're just focused on\ntomorrow's game and we'll get them next\ntime\nthis is an\nexcellent\nresponse to failure\nthere are three parts to it worth\nmentioning in the first part there's a\nrecognition of what could be improved\nthe passing was poor they weren't making\ntheir free throws\nthose behaviors were instrumental to the\nfailure in a reality-based way\nand they are simultaneously the\nopportunities for growth and improvement\nthat will decrease the possibility of\nfailure in the future\ngood\nsecond there's the non-defensive\nacceptance of failure this demonstrates\na good degree of dignity and respect\nboth for oneself and if appropriate for\none's opponent\nand third the result is ultimately\nforward facing\nthere is no\ninclination to ruminate or sulk\ntomorrow's a new day and tomorrow's a\nnew game i believe in myself i believe\nin my team\nand we'll get them next time\nall told i think that's an excellent way\nof responding\nto the inevitability of failure on the\npath toward mastery try it out for\nyourself\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
