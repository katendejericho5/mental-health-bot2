    "transcript": "in my recent episode what men and women\nlook for in sexual behaviors olga l\ncommented\nif there is something off about the\nwoman's character and behavior a decent\nman will get turned off no matter how\nvisually attractive she is\nand i'm here to tell you that's not\nactually true that might be how we think\nit should be or how we hope it would be\nas was mentioned in one of the comments\nto this comment\nbut that's\nrunning in the face of what we know\nabout healthy male sexual behavior which\nis primarily visually attracted for\nbetter for worse because to be honest\nthis often gets men into a lot of\ntrouble\nthere's also a subtle shaming aspect to\nthis comment which suggests that if a\nman is not turned off by a visually\nattractive woman by her behavior or\ncharacter that he's somehow not decent\nagain this is how we might want reality\nto be but it's not actually how men\nbehave because they're able to\ncompartmentalize behavior and\npersonality from attractiveness"
