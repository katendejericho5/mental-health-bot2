    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to be extraordinary\nin life\nto be extraordinary is something that's\nwithin everybody's reach\nto understand how this is possible we\nneed only examine the mystery of the\nword itself look at it\nextraordinary extra\nordinary\nan extraordinary person is more ordinary\nthan ordinary that's one way to\nunderstand this word\nand what does that mean look i've talked\nto a lot of people in my life both\npersonally and professionally i've lived\non this planet for nearly 40 years and i\ncan tell you that one of the rarest\npersonal attributes in the world\nis humility\nwhat i am impressed with at this stage\nof my life is not riches or fame or\nbeautiful women\nmany of the people i've worked for have\nthese things\nand yet they still come to me for advice\non how to be happy you need to think\nabout that for a minute\nwhat impresses me\nis the ability to be content with very\nlittle\nwhat impresses me is the ability to live\nat peace with yourself\nand with those around you\nwhat impresses me is the willingness to\nput the needs of others ahead of your\nown i know some people who can do these\nthings\nthey're better people than i am and i\nlook up to them and admire them\nand what impresses me further about\nthese people is\nis the extent to which they can do those\nthree things that i mentioned without\nthe recompense of praise or fame or\nwealth\nthey seem amply rewarded by the\ncontentment that they enjoy\nby the warm and loving relationships\nthat they experience with their friends\nand family\nand by the opportunity to serve their\nfellow man\nthese are compensations that are worth\nmore than money precisely because they\ncan't be bought at any price\nyou see\nthe whole world thinks they're above\naverage\nand the whole world is clamoring to be\nrecognized for their talents and their\nabilities and their efforts\nwe all start off thinking we're harry\npotter\nan undervalued exception who is destined\nfor great things\nhowever\nthat's just not the reality\nmost of us will not have statues built\nin our likenesses or millions of adoring\nfans or a place in the enduring ark of\nculture\nbut maybe greatness is not so much what\nwe do\nas it is the way of being\nthat we embody when we show up to do it\nand this is expressed in the zen koan\nbefore enlightenment chop would carry\nwater\nafter enlightenment chop wood carry\nwater\nmaybe what's extraordinary is not so\nmuch what we do\nbut how we go about doing it\nand the higher we go the more we are\ncontent with less\nand it's this extra ordinariness that i\nbelieve is within the reach of every\nhuman being\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
