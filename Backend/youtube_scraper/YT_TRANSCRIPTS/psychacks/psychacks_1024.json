    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nlife is a mystery to be experienced\nwhen i was younger and a bit more\nintellectually arrogant\ni believe that some of the big questions\nin life were still unanswered simply\nbecause a person of sufficient ability\nhadn't yet come along to answer them and\ni believe that i was smart enough to be\nable to solve some of these apparently\nunsolvable problems of life\nand i no longer believe either of these\nto be true\ni think that there are many aspects of\nthe universe and existence itself\nthat are irreducibly\nmysterious\ni mean as a very specific example you\nhave the quantum uncertainty principle\nwhich stipulates that we cannot know the\nexact position and velocity of a\nparticle simultaneously this problem is\nnot due to a lack of clarity it's not\ndue to inappropriate instrumentation\nit's not due to insufficient resolution\nit's inherent to reality itself\nor\nthere's the fact that we are composed of\ntrillions and trillions of cells and are\nabsolutely gigantic relative to the\ncomponents of our being while at the\nsame time we're floating on a tiny speck\nof rock around an unremarkable star in\nthe distant corner of a dusty galaxy\namong billions caroaming through the\nexpanding universe\nwe are both\nincomprehensibly large and\nincomprehensibly small\nat the same time\nand that's not a problem that can be\nsolved through mentation through\nintellectualization\nboth are true and there's no way\nof reducing the mystery of scale one way\nor another\nwe'll never decide nope it's actually\nwe're very small\nor no it's actually we're very big\nboth mutually exclusive realities are\nsimultaneously true at the same time\nthis is not a problem to be solved it's\na mystery to be embraced with the heart\nand life is characterized by an almost\ninfinite number of these irreducible\nmysteries and my work as i get older has\nbeen to surrender this impulse to\ncollapse everything down to certainty to\ndefiniteness\nusing the tool of the intellect\nbecause i now understand that the\nintellect as amazing as it is\nhas inherent limitations on what it can\nand can't accomplish\ni now understand the universe\nhas no obligation to be rational\nthe universe has no obligation to\nrestrict its being to what can be\ncomprehended by the intellect\nas hamlet says to horatio there are more\nthings in heaven and earth than are\ndreamt of in your philosophy\nultimately the universe is what it is\nand it's far more complex and mysterious\nthan anything our minds can ever hope to\ncomprehend\nand so rather than try to reduce the\nuniverse to those dimensions that are\ncomprehensible to the intellect only\nlet's reposition ourselves relative to\nbeing such that we can accept with our\nhearts the mystery of what is\nand i think that when we do that we have\na much richer and more interesting and\nmore peaceful life\nwe don't have to figure everything out\nand that's good because not everything\nis figured out\nsometimes we just have to accept what is\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation or offer\na donation you can see the about tab for\nmore information\nthanks for listening"
