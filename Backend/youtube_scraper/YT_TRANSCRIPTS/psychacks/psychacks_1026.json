    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat\nis the sexual marketplace\nthe sexual marketplace is\neverywhere\nand we're all in it\nand we all have whether we like it or\nnot\na perceived value within that\nmarketplace and just like the stock\nmarket that perceived value fluctuates\nfrom moment to moment\nincreasing or decreasing depending on\ncontext demand and the perception of the\npotential buyer\nmore than anything else it's our\nperceived value within the sexual\nmarketplace that determines our\noptionality with respect to potential\nsexual partners at any given time and\nthat's just the way it is\nin this talk i'd like to introduce a\nmetaphor that i often use to help people\nunderstand how the sexual marketplace\nworks it goes like this i'd like you to\nconsider that the sexual marketplace\nis like a harbor\na pier\na place where all the boats are okay\nand that men and women have different\nroles within this metaphor\nwe'll discuss each in turn starting with\nthe men\nmen\nit's kind of a good news bad news\nsituation my brothers\nin this metaphor you have three tasks\nthree things you need to do\nand none of them is easy\nyou also won't be getting a lot of help\nif you're a man there's no free lunch\nyou should expect that without these\nthings women aren't going to really look\nyour way and men will step over you on\nthe street so what are these tasks first\nyou need to build a boat\nsecond\nyou need to learn to sail\nand third\nyou need to chart a course\ndo you understand you have to have\nresources\nyou need to be competent\nand you need to have an overarching\npurpose\nonly then\ncan you dock your boat in the harbor of\nthe sectional marketplace and\nsuccessfully attract the attention of\nwomen in earnest\nthis is bad news because any one of\nthese tasks is a lot of work that could\ntake years to accomplish however it's\nalso good news because anything you\nspend that much time mastering is yours\nby rights and cannot easily be taken\naway from you\nand what about all the women well in\nthis metaphor the women get to go down\nto the harbor and look at all\nthe boats\nthey get to kick their proverbial tires\nand look at the cabins and examine the\nmanifests and interview the captains the\ncaptains are all standing in front of\ntheir boats looking for passengers hey\nhey hey do you want to get on this boat\nhow about a ride\nfancy a cruise my dear i'm going to\nhawaii well i'm going to australia i'm\ngoing to hong kong\nyou're welcome to come on board\nthe women have their pick of it\nand this isn't as easy as it looks\nbecause they know\nthat each captain is going to advertise\nhis particular boat in the best possible\nlight\nso the women have to test her available\noptions and conduct some due diligence\nbefore making their decision\nwhich boat is the most seaworthy will it\nstay in one piece out in the open seas\nwhich captain is the most trustworthy\nwill he take me where he says he's going\nto go which boat is the most comfortable\nwill i be able to live on board for an\nextended period of time\nthese are important questions\nand eventually she's going to make her\nchoice i like this boat i trust this\ncaptain i want to go to that destination\nlet's do it\nand if the man accepts her choice he\nwelcomes her on board and the two sail\noff into the sunset\ni mean not really of course but this is\njust the introduction to the metaphor\nhowever that's basically how the sexual\nmarketplace works if you're a man you\ngotta build a boat\nlearn to sail and chart a course\nand if you're a woman you gotta examine\nthe boat\ntest the captain and confirm the\nmanifest\nand what happens after the boat leaves\nport\nwell that's the topic for another\nepisode\nwhat do you think please like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm\nseriously it's important and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
