    "transcript": "in my recent video the fear of\ncommitment there was a number of\ncomments that basically suggested that\nwhereas\nmaybe most men do not have a fear of\ncommitment that a subset of men\ntypically those who are anxious avoidant\nmen do have a fear of commitment and i'd\nlike to say that that's i don't actually\nagree with that perspective and here's\nwhy\nagain anxious avoidant men\ntypically do not fear commitment many of\nthese are like software programmers they\nhave high paying jobs they have leases\nthey get into contractual agreements all\nthe time\nwhat anxious avoidant men and women are\nafraid of is not commitment\nor just the\nconsistent discharge of obligation\nthey're afraid of engulfment\nand this was a point that someone made\none of his comments which is sometimes\nit's not about offering more because\nmore can be a worse offer to an avoidant\nperson sometimes less is more"
