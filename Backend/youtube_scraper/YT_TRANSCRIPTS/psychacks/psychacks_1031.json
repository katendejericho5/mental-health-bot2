    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe fear of commitment\nnow this is a judgment that is usually\nleveled by women at men\nwhen men don't want to enter into a\nrelationship with them\nand while it is certainly true that\nthere are some men out there that are\nlegitimately afraid like\nfearful of commitment\ni'm here to tell you that the vast\nmajority of men are not in fact afraid\nof commitment and in this episode i will\nexplain why\nmen understand that in order to\naccomplish anything great in life\nyou need allies\nyou can't send a rocket to the moon or\nmanage a billion dollar investment fund\nall by yourself you need partners you\nneed to be a part of the team\nthis is a part\nthis is true of my own experience as\nwell\ni have committed to many things over the\nyears in order to accomplish things i\ncouldn't do alone i've committed to a\ncourse of graduate study that required\n120 hours of work a week for years\ni've taken out several substantial loans\nand paid back every penny\ni've\nserved as an elected official on the\nboards of nonprofits and local\ngovernments\ni've developed virtual products with a\nteam of web developers on the other side\nof the world\nto be sold on the global market\ni go to the gym every other day whether\ni feel like it or not and my word is my\nbond if i say i'm going to do something\nyou can consider it done\ni've accomplished a great deal in my\nlife through discipline forbearance and\ncommitment\ni have no problem with commitment\nand yet i too have been accused of being\nafraid of commitment from specific women\nwhen i've turned down their invitations\nfor a relationship\nyou may not want to hear this but here's\nthe ugly truth\nif a guy turns down an invitation for a\nrelationship\nit's probably not because he's afraid of\ncommitment\nit's probably because\nyour offer isn't good enough\nplain and simple\nconsider the same scenario in a\nprofessional context\ni have a private psychotherapy practice\nbut just for fun i note on linkedin that\ni'm open to job offers from recruiters i\nlike to see what else is out there to\nstay relevant and every once in a while\ni'm called by a recruiter and it's\nfascinating how these conversations go\nthey tell me the compensation and i'll\nrespond that i make three times that\nthey'll tell me it's a 40 hour a week\njob i'll tell them that i work 25 hours\na week they'll tell me that i have to\nreport to the clinical director i'll\ntell them that i'm my own boss\nthey'll say i have to come into the\noffice i'll tell them that i get to work\nfrom home\nthey'll say i would get four weeks\nvacation i tell them that i take all the\ntime off that i want\nand they look at me\nand i look at them\nand we obviously don't do a deal\nbut i guarantee that they don't go away\nthinking\nthat i have a fear of employment\nit's that what they have to offer isn't\nbetter than what i've already got\non the other hand if their offer\nimproved my situation i would have no\nproblem signing the contract i've signed\nmany contracts in my time\nlook a commitment is a sacrifice\nit's a relinquishing of significant\nopportunity and usually requires a great\ndeal\nof time energy and money\nthere has to be some upside some\ncompensation involved and if the\ncompensation associated with this\ncommitment is less\nthan what i can expect to enjoy from\neither remaining a free agent or from\nanother commitment i can reasonably hope\nto enjoy in the future\nit would be foolish of me to take that\nopportunity\nrejecting such an offer isn't a fear of\ncommitment\nit's exercising prudence with respect to\nallocating my limited resources\nso if you're having trouble ladies if\nthis is the situation in your life you\nmight have to take a long and hard look\nat what you have to offer the specific\nman you're inviting into a relationship\nyou have to make an offer\nthat he would perceive as a significant\nimprovement\nover his current situation\nor else you're not going to get a deal\nhe is not afraid of commitment he is\ntelling you that your offer is not good\nenough\nthat may sound mean but\nit's meaner to pretend that that's not\nthe fact\nsomething to consider\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and see the about tab for\nmore information on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
