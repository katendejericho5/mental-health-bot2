    "transcript": "vanessa mcbride asks do attachment\nproblems have levels of severity and\nwhat causes them absolutely\nwe are moved away from a\ncategorical definition of mental illness\nand more towards a continuum model we\nnow believe that pretty much all\nproblems that people encounter are\nthey're not really binary it's not like\nyou're either depressed or you're not\ndepressed\nbut there's a continuum of depression\nfrom mild to moderate to severe etc and\nthe same is certainly true for\nattachment problems\nwhere do they come from\nalmost all attachment problems\nderive from some sort of failure rupture\nor trauma within a primary attachment\nrelationship which is generally between\nthe child and at least one of his or her\nparents\nat um at a young age\nthis isn't 100\nacross the board but i would say it's at\nleast 90 percent"
