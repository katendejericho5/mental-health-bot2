    "transcript": "zen's vlog asks\nwhat drove you to start your channel\nwell to be honest i had a pretty\nidealistic aim when starting this\nchannel\ni work with a lot of people individually\nand i feel very fulfilled and\nrewarded by my work as a clinical\npsychologist\nbut it also means that i really only\nwork with\n20 to 30 people at a time and i had this\nconviction\nthat the things that were helping these\n20 or 30 folks\nif they had a wider platform would have\nthe potential of helping\nhundreds thousands maybe even millions\nof other people because people are not\nall that different from one another when\nwe get down to it and so the goal of\nthis channel is to reduce the amount of\nunnecessary suffering in this world\nby taking the lessons and the teachings\nand the healings that i have cultivated\nand delivered through individual\npsychotherapy to a wider platform\nhope it helps"
