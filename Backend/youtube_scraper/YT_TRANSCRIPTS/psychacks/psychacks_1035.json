    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraband and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to get people to like you more\nthere is a very simple trick to get\npeople to like you more it takes three\nseconds to explain what it is but be\nsure to watch through the end of the\nepisode if you want to know why it works\nthe trick to making someone like you\nmore\nis asking them to do things for you\ntold you it was simple\nand why does this work the leading\nhypothesis is basically that the\nincrease in attraction that results from\nasking people to do things for you is a\nbyproduct of their attempts to eliminate\nthe cognitive dissonance created by this\nsituation\nand what does that mean\nlook\npeople don't go around doing favors for\nother people\nso if you ask a favor of someone and\nthey do it they kind of have a problem\nit's like within their own consciousness\nthey understand that they typically do\nnot go out of their way for other people\nand yet\nthey're apparently going out of their\nway\nfor you\nhmm\nand why might that be\nwell the most common way of resolving\nthat cognitive dissonance is to decide\nthat they're going out of their way for\nyou\nwell\nbecause they\nlike you because\nyou must be a special person to them\nyeah that must be it that's why i'm\ngoing out of my way for this person and\ndoing things i wouldn't ordinarily do\nfor other people i must really like them\nso to increase attraction you should ask\nother people to do things for you on the\nother hand to increase attraction you\nshould not\ndo things for other people\nespecially\nunasked four things\nwhen you do things for other people\nyou make them feel special\nwithin their frame of reference they\nthink oh\nthe reason why this person is giving me\ngifts are going out of their way which\nthey don't do for other people\nis because\ni'm a special person\nand as a special person i deserve\ngifts or people going out of their way\nfor me\nif you do things for others they might\nthink oh you're such a sweetheart\nor\nyou're such a nice guy\nso if that's what you're going for great\nbut\nthey're definitely not going to feel\nmore attracted to you as a result\nback to asking people to do things for\nyou these don't have to be big requests\nit could be hey could you bring a bottle\nof wine to dinner or hey could you send\nme your notes from yesterday's biology\nclass or hey could you pick me up a loaf\nof bread on your way home from work\nthe requests don't have to be big in\nfact it's better if they're not\nbut if the other people comply the\nupshot is that they will come to like\nyou more\nwhether they like it or not\nthat's the hack\ntry it out for yourself and let me know\nhow it goes\nsomething to consider\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
