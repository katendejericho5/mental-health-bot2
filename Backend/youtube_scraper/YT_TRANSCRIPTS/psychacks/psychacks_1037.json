    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe power of half\nso this is going to be a story time\nstory times are episodes that i will\nperiodically release in which i talk\nabout my life\ni've had a lot of interesting\nexperiences and some of those\nexperiences i think have important and\npowerful lessons for myself and others\nand many viewers have expressed\ncuriosity about my life as well so i\nthought i'd tell some stories so this\nstory is called the power of half\nso when i was a teenager i was very\ninterested in meditation and when i was\n19 years old i went to live at the\nshaolin monastery in china to study kung\nfu and qigong under a master teacher\nit was a very\nvery difficult experience the regimen\npushed me out of my comfort zone in many\nsignificant ways we were doing week-long\nfasts we were meditating 20 hours a day\nit was almost superhuman it was also my\nfirst time in a radically different\nculture where i was identifiably other\nand didn't speak the language i had a\ncouple of breakdowns i had a few\nbreakthroughs and it was overall a very\npowerful experience for me\ni remember one day i was sitting in my\nclassroom with my teacher\nwe when we weren't actively meditating\nhe would usually talk about the next\nexercise or some sort of spiritual\ndoctrine however this time\napropos of nothing\nhe started talking about money\nhe said that if anyone asks you for\nmoney\ngive them half\nit was a real non-sequitur i and i think\nthat's why it kind of stuck i was like\nwhy is he talking about this\nbut that's what he said if anybody asks\nyou for money give them half\nokay\na few days later i decided to go for a\nwalk in the countryside outside of town\nback then shaolin was a small village\nwith one dirt road through the center of\ntown sounded by pasture and mountains\nand i thought it would be pleasant to\nwalk in nature\nhowever i was followed out of town by a\ngroup of maybe 10 teenage boys students\nof the martial arts academies there in\nxiaolin\nnow they didn't speak any english and i\ndidn't speak any mandarin so it was\ntough going at the beginning but they\neventually formed a circle around me\na few of them started picking up rocks\nmaking threatening gestures and grimaces\nat that point i understood i was in a\nsticky situation\nnow for a brief instant the thought\ncrossed my mind like hmm time to see how\ngood my kung fu really is let's see if i\ncan take all 10 guys by myself but\nunfortunately that thought was very\nshort-lived as i realized that that\nwould have been a bad decision if i took\non 10 guys i wouldn't come out of that\nsituation looking pretty\nso\nthen what\nthey're looking at me\ni'm looking at them i'm thinking how am\ni gonna get out of this situation\nwhen i remember what my teacher said a\nfew days ago and i thought well i don't\nhave a better idea so let's try this out\nso i took out my wallet and i showed\nthem all my money\nwhich wasn't all that much mind you and\ni separated it into two piles and i said\nwith my gestures okay this half is for\nyou guys\nand this half is for me\ni'm giving you all half\nand the guys looked at each other\nand they looked at me\nand they all seemed to agree that yes\nthis was the most equitable possible\narrangement\nand they took half the money divided it\namong themselves and then slapped me on\nthe back and went on their merry way\nthey certainly could have snatched both\npiles of money\nthey certainly could have forced more\nout of me they had numbers on their side\nbut in that moment\ni learned that there was something\npsychologically powerful about the idea\nof equal halves\nthose guys weren't entitled to any of\nthat money\nand they could have taken it all\nand yet they were content with half\namazing i was amazed\nin the first place that the half-trick\nworked\nand in the second place that my teacher\nhad instructed me to do this two days\nprior to the actual event it was pretty\nuncanny\nso if you ever find yourself in a tough\nsituation you can always try the half\ntrick turns out that halfness has some\npower to it a psychological validity\nthat is not to be underestimated anyway\ni hope you enjoyed this let me know in\nthe comments if you want more story time\nepisodes and please remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation about donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
