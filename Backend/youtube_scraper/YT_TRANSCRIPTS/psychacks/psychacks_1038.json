    "transcript": "in my video the balance of the\nattraction victor asks is it better for\none gender to be the adored\nthis is a touchy question i think it's\ncompletely appropriate and reasonable\nfor both men and women to occupy both\npositions the adored and the adorer that\nsaid in general i think women are more\ncomfortable in the position of the\nadorer\nwhy is that because as you recall from\nour discussion the person that\npositioned the adorer has more of an\nemotional experience he or she has more\nintense and frequent emotions\nespecially compared with the adored who\ngenerally has a more stable equilibrated\nexperience and what i've found though of\ncourse there are individual differences\nwomen tend to enjoy being within their\nemotions\nmore than men and i found it that women\ngenerally find it more difficult to\nabide in a relationship if they don't\nhave that emotional experience"
