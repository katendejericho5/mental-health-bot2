    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ndanger and uncertainty\nso this isn't a perspective you're\nlikely to hear all that often but it's\none that i found quite useful in my own\nlife and one that i often discuss with\nmy clients\nwhich is that a life that is entirely\nfree\nof danger and uncertainty\nis lacking\nif you arrive at a state where you have\neverything that you want exactly the way\nthat you want it\nthere's often the sense that something\nis missing\nand it can be very hard to put your\nfinger on just what that something is\nbecause on the surface everything looks\nideal\nto counteract this feeling i found that\nthere's something really useful in\nincorporating what i call responsible\ndanger and predictable uncertainty into\nmy life responsible danger\nand predictable uncertainty let's look\nat each one in turn\nit's important to take responsible risks\nand this is because\nthe absence of risk\nis itself risky the absence of risk\nincreases fragility and complacency and\ndecreases opportunity and growth\nthere is no such thing\nas a completely riskless decision and so\nit's important to be intentional about\nchoosing what dangers we believe are\nworth exposing ourselves to\nas opposed to trying to avoid them\nentirely\nbeing willing to cross the threshold of\ndanger in a responsible fashion allows\nyou to sharpen your edge and to tolerate\nmore discomfort and pain which tends to\nmake your life easier in the long run\ndanger also helps you see who you really\nare and what you're actually capable of\nfor me i cross the threshold of danger\non my solo trips into the wilderness\namong other things and these experiences\nallow me to know myself in ways i just\nwouldn't be able to\nwhen i'm in the midst of comfort and\nsecurity and for that reason these\nexperiences are very valuable to me\nthe second thing to consider is\npredictable uncertainty now why is this\nhelpful well if you\nif all you ever do\nis what you choose to do\nthen you will likely only be exposed to\nmore of the same this is the same\nselection bias that tends to create echo\nchambers on social media platforms it's\nimportant to introduce randomness or\nunpredictability into your life because\nit exposes you to ideas or experiences\nthat might be very beneficial to you but\nthat you would never choose of your own\nvolition\nunpredictability also injects novelty\nwhich is a psychological need into your\nlife and creates opportunities for\ngrowth which facilitate\nself-actualization the apex\nof maslow's hierarchy of needs\nso what might this look like planned\nuncertainty could be closing your eyes\nputting your finger on a map and going\nto that place to explore\nor it could be adopting someone else's\nrecommendations for a course of action\nwhich is kind of a curated approach to\npredictable uncertainty\nfor instance i'm currently making my way\nthrough the penguin books great ideas\nseries\neverything i've read so far has been\nthought provoking and many of the books\nare ones i would never think to pick up\nand read on my own\ncreating space for opportunities like\nthis broadens your perspective and\nenriches your personality\nsomething to consider\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and\nsee the about tab for more information\non donations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
