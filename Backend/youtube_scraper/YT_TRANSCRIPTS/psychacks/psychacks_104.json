    "transcript": "a lot of you ladies create these really\ncomplex and elaborate funnels that make\nit harder and harder for you to receive\nthe love that you say that you want and\njust like the business with the\ncomplicated sales funnel that is\nultimately to your detriment I have\nheard women say that they felt unloved\nwhen a man didn't read a book she\nrecommended or when he didn't notice her\nnew manicure or when he didn't want to\nwatch a show with her or when he\nwouldn't listen to her problems without\noffering Solutions or etc etc etc these\nfrustrations and disappointments reveal\na complex evolving and often unconscious\nsystem of requirements a woman is\nsubject to imposing on her relationships\nif we were to work backwards it would\nsuggest that in order for this woman to\nfeel loved which presumably is something\nthat she wants she needs a man to read\nher book recommendations notice her\nmanicure watch her shows listen to her\nproblems without offering Solutions all\nthis does is unnecessarily complicate\nher love funnel which will absolutely\nresult in her receiving less love not\nmore"
