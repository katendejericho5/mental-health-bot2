    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to be\nimpeccable with your word\nso it's very important to learn how to\nMarshal your language cleanly clearly\nand effectively ultimately you can\narrive at a place of impeccability with\nyour word it's pristine it's true and\nit's binding\nnow there are two easy ways to get\nstarted on the path towards\nimpeccability I practice these myself\nand have been doing so for years\nfirst practice is to never say something\nabout somebody else that you wouldn't be\nwilling to say to their face\nlet's be honest we talk about other\npeople we talk about our friends we talk\nabout our family we talk about\ncelebrities we talk about all kinds of\npeople when they're not around\nand if you're talking to somebody\nyou're talking about somebody in a way\nthat you wouldn't have the courage to\ntalk about them looking them dead in the\neye\nyou shouldn't be flapping your gums my\nfriend\neven if you think you'll never meet them\neven if they're already dead and gone\njust don't do it if you're not willing\nto say it to their face\nthen whatever you're about to say is\neither not your real opinion or it does\nnot carry the strength of conviction\nwhich means you're not really in\nalignment with yourself when you talk\nlike that\nso anytime I find myself speaking about\nsomebody else a third party who's not\npresent I imagine that they're actually\nsitting right next to the person that\nI'm talking to\nand this is useful because generally\nwhat I do say about other people behind\ntheir backs tends to get back to them\nand I might eventually be in a situation\nwhere I will have to be willing to\nrepeat my comments to their face\nnow keep in mind that I'm not saying\nthat you have to say nice things about\neverybody certain people I would have no\nproblem telling off\nbut I have to make that decision\nconsciously and if I do say something\nabout somebody else I have to sort of\nexpect that it will eventually get back\nto them okay so that's the first\npractice\nthe second practice to help you towards\nimpeccability is to never say something\nthat you wouldn't want quoted in the\nnewspaper\ndon't use words don't use phrases don't\nuse language that if it were quoted in\nthe newspaper or put on the 10 o'clock\nnews or released for the entire world to\nsee on the internet that you would feel\nembarrassed that people knew that you\nspoke that way and I don't mean just\npeople in general I mean your third\ngrade teacher your priest your\ngrandmother would these people be\nembarrassed on your behalf to learn\nthat's how you speak in private\nin this practice you move toward an\nethical way of speaking by reducing the\ndifference between your public and\nprivate speech this cultivates Integrity\nnow again this doesn't mean that you\nhave to be nice all the time but it does\nkind of force you to speak more\nintentionally because by saying anything\nat all you run the risk of disagreement\noffense and conflict\nand if you're voicing opinions that you\nwould subsequently retract under social\npressure\nthen you really had no business voicing\nthose opinions in the first place did\nyou\nby standing with your word you may need\nto make a stand further down the road\nso don't talk in a way that will\nembarrass yourself if your words were\nuniversally known\nokay so those are my two tricks to get\nstarted towards impeccability never say\nsomething about somebody else that you\nwouldn't be willing to say to their face\nand never say something that you\nwouldn't want quoted in the newspaper\nlet me know how it goes please like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand please see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
