    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nkilling the hope\nkilling the hope is an emotional\nsurvival strategy and one that is most\napplicable in the wake of a breakup\nso let's say that an important\nrelationship has ended and while you\nunderstand intellectually that it's over\nemotionally you still retain the hope\nthat somehow in the future you will be\nreconciled with your ex and there will\nbe a chance for the two of you to get\nback together it's not rational but you\nfeel it nonetheless\nyou know that this is the case because\nyou catch yourself ruminating about the\nex you can't let them go and you can't\nmove on to somebody else the space in\nyour heart is occupied by the memory of\nthat person\nand even though that memory causes you\nnothing but pain you hold on to it\nand that's because there's a sense that\nif you were to surrender the pain\nthen there would be nothing left to bind\nyou to the lost loved one\nyou harbor the hope\nbecause you believe the pain\nis preferable to nothingness\nand you believe that if you don't hold\non to the pain which is the hope of\nreconciliation\nand that your ex has already surrendered\nthat pain then once you relinquish that\npain\nthen the relationship will be completely\nand irrevocably lost\nand that's a lie\nthat's actually not true and i'll\nexplain why in a moment however right\nnow the important thing is to understand\nthat your hope is corroding your heart\nit's killing you from the inside\nnow it's not for me or for anybody else\nto tell you when it's time to kill the\nhope because hope is a very precious and\nintimate thing\nand yet in order to survive\nin order to continue to emotionally live\nsometimes it's necessary to kill the\nhope and once you decide to do that\nthere's no turning back\nit's a ruthless procedure but one that\ncould save your life\nto kill the hope you have to eliminate\nany interior contact with the\ninternalized object of your ex there's a\nlot of talk on youtube about no contact\nbut not communicating with another\nperson is only the most superficial\nunderstanding of what no contact means\ntrue no contact means not coming into\nemotional contact with the internal\nobject with which is the memory the\nimage the fantasy of the other person\nevery time that internal object is\nactivated you vigorously block and\nreplace it with something else and you\ndo that over and over and over and over\nand over again sometimes hundreds of\ntimes a day and you thereby weaken the\npower of that hope\ninternal no contact is like applying a\ntourniquet it cuts off the blood flow to\nthat part of you so that it withers away\nand dies\nnot a very pleasant operation but one\nthat in certain cases might be essential\nto survival\nnow the reason why letting go of the\nhope doesn't actually make your\nsituation objectively hopeless is this\nlet's say that after six months after 12\nmonths after two years whatever your ex\nfor whatever reason were to come back\ninto your life\nand if this person were to find you in\nexactly the same state that he or she\nleft you in\nsix months 12 months two years ago\nthen whatever motivated them to leave\nyou in the first place would likely\nstill be present\nthey're gonna think wow\ni dodged a bullet\ni was right to leave this person they\nhaven't changed at all\nexes often do come back however a lot of\ntimes they're just spying on you from\nafar to help them feel better about\nending the relationship\nand if they ever actively re-enter your\nlife it will not be because they sense\nthat you are still holding on to a\ncandle of hope for their return\nit will be because they like who you\nhave become in the interim\nso killing the hope doesn't objectively\ndecrease your chances of an eventual\nreconciliation however paradoxically\nby killing the hope you resign yourself\nto moving on with your life without any\nexpectation that you'll ever see that\nperson again as long as you live\nit's ruthless but effective\nlet me know what you think please like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand please see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations and\nconsultations thanks for listening"
