    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat is a deal breaker\nthis is an important subject and this\nepisode will contain a lot of\ninformation so you may need to listen to\nit more than once all the way to the end\neveryone is entitled to his or her deal\nbreakers when it comes to relationships\nwhether they're professional romantic or\nfamilial it's not for me to say what\nanother person's deal breakers should be\nhowever\nsome deal breakers are what i call\norganic deal breakers which are\nbehaviors that if left unchecked\nwill destroy the relationship all by\nitself even if everything else about the\nrelationship is perfect\nso for example i consider alcoholism to\nbe an organic deal breaker\nit's not possible to be in a committed\nrelationship with an alcoholic because\nthe alcoholic is already in another\nrelationship with alcohol\neven if everything else about that\nrelationship is amazing the alcoholism\nif left unchecked will destroy the\nrelationship all by itself\nthrough the lying and the hiding and the\nchaos and destruction that it tends that\ndisease\ntherefore this is a behavior that can't\ngo unaddressed within the relationship\nand so you can approach this behavior as\nan advocate for the relationship not\nonly is it likely that you would prefer\nnot to be in a relationship with an\nalcoholic so you're speaking up for\nyourself\nthe relationship literally cannot\nsupport that behavior so you're speaking\nup for the relationship you're basically\nsaying hey\ni care about us\ni care about this relationship and this\nbehavior will destroy it so i'm\nadvocating on behalf of us\non behalf of our relationship against\nthis behavior\nand then you give the other person a\nfree choice you say to him or her i'm\nnot going to stick around to see how\nthis plays out i know how it's going to\nplay out it's going to destroy the\nrelationship all by itself\nand so i'm going to ask you to choose\ndo you want to have a relationship with\nme\nor do you want to keep your relationship\nwith alcohol\nand then you have to be willing to\naccept whatever the other person chooses\nbecause that person who might very well\nbe in his or her act of addiction might\ntell you to go pound sand\nand that's painful\nor that person might finally decide to\ntake the necessary steps to heal and\nrecover from that addiction over years\nand that's a different kind of pain\nso if something is a deal breaker for\nyou\nyou can approach it from the position of\nbeing an advocate for the relationship\nand you can give the other person a free\nchoice with respect to how they would\nlike to proceed and then you accept that\nchoice for better or for worse okay\non the other hand\nif you're dealing with a behavior that's\nannoying that you'd prefer didn't exist\nthat you don't like\nbut that won't necessarily\ndestroy the relationship and that isn't\ncausing you enough pain to inspire your\nwillingness to walk away from that\nrelationship because of it\nthen you shouldn't bring it up\nif you do you're just complaining and\nyou're not willing to do anything about\nit\nbringing up issues like these with your\npartner is very similar to going out to\neat at a restaurant receiving your food\nand then calling the waiter over to say\nuh excuse me this chicken is undercooked\nthese vegetables are soggy and\neverything is cold but then stopping the\nwaiter when he reaches for your plate to\ntake it away saying no\ni'm still gonna eat this\ni just wanted you to know that i'm\nunhappy and that this food is terrible\nyou're just going to be the\ncustomer in that situation it's like if\nit's a problem\nbe willing to make a change\nand this could mean sending the food\nback or leaving the restaurant entirely\nand if you're not willing to do that\nthen do your best to enjoy what you have\nbecause if you complain about things\nthat aren't worth complaining about\nbecause you're not willing to do\nanything about them\nyou degrade the quality of your\nrelationship with that person and this\nis stupid because you have to continue\nto live in that degraded relationship\nyou've chosen\nif you're not willing to leave\nthen why degrade the quality of that\nrelationship by complaining\nunnecessarily\nso that's kind of how i look at a\nproblem in a relationship either it's a\ndeal breaker or it's not if it's a deal\nbreaker you advocate for the\nrelationship and you're willing to leave\nif it doesn't get addressed\nand if it's not a deal breaker you don't\nbring it up and you work within yourself\nas to why this is such a problem for you\nsomething to consider\nplease like comment and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and please see the about\ntab for more information on donations\nand consultations thanks for listening"
