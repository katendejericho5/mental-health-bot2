    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is to be\nfree\nyou cannot do whatever you want\nnow there's a little asterisk next to\nthis one which i'll explain at the end\nof the episode but in the vast majority\nof cases it's true that to be free you\ncannot do whatever you want the best way\nto understand this is by looking at the\nnatural universe there are many many\nexamples of this principle but here's\none\nconsider the earth as it travels around\nthe sun in its annual revolution\nit has been freely moving around the sun\nin an unobstructed fashion\nfor billions of years\nthat is some pretty legitimate free\nmotion\nhowever\nit's only able to persist in this\nfreedom because it is restricted\nin its orbit\nif the earth were to move further from\nthe sun then its orbit would become so\nelongated that it would be slingshot\ninto space\nand would likely be consumed by a gas\ngiant and if the earth were to move\ncloser to the sun then the gravitational\npull would be too great and it would\nspiral into a solar collision if the\nearth were to exercise freedom of\nmovement arbitrarily\nit would soon no longer be free to move\nas it would be destroyed\nit can only persist in freedom\nif it restricts itself to move in\nalignment with the greater system in\nwhich it is a part\na freedom today\nthat isn't a freedom tomorrow\nisn't really freedom do you understand\nfreedom is only true freedom if in\nchoosing it you can persist in being\nfree\nfreedom that cannot persist in itself is\nby definition subject to a more powerful\nforce\nin choosing that course of action you\nare choosing subjection to the more\npowerful force this is not freedom this\nis destruction in slow motion\nso what does this mean\nthis means that if we want to continue\nto enjoy freedom in our lives for\nemotion free will free choice\nwe have to make choices that align\nourselves with that which allows that\nfreedom to continue to exist\nto return to my previous metaphor we\nhave to find the right orbit\nand most choices will not do that\nmost choices will tend to limit our\nfreedom\nand move us toward destruction over time\nbecause they're just not sustainable\nyou want to eat whatever you want\nyou can\nbut that's not really sustainable you'll\nrun into health problems and sooner or\nlater you won't be free to eat anything\nyou want to do whatever you want in\nsociety\nyou can but that's not really\nsustainable you'll run into legal\nproblems and sooner or later you won't\nbe free to do anything in society\nyou want to spend money however you want\nyou can\nbut it's not really sustainable you'll\nrun into financial problems and sooner\nor later you won't be free to spend any\nmoney\nokay however there's one exception to\nall this the asterisk that i mentioned\nat the beginning of the episode\nthe only way you can remain free by\ndoing whatever you want is if you\nsucceed in disciplining your wanting to\nsuch a degree\nthat you only want that which will allow\nyou to continue to be free i'll say that\nagain the only way you can remain free\nby doing whatever you want is if you\nsucceed in disciplining your wanting to\nsuch a degree that you only want\nthat which will allow you to continue to\nbe free\nif you can do that\nthen you're free to want whatever you\nwant in perfect safety\nand if you can please reach out because\ni'd like to study under you the vast\nmajority of us myself included are just\nnot there yet so it's important to\ndiscipline our wanting and to be prudent\nabout how we exercise our freedoms today\nso that we can continue to exercise our\nfreedoms tomorrow\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and please\nsee the about tab for more information\non donations and consultations\nthanks for listening"
