    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic today's short talk is how\nto love without emotional attachment\nnow this is a topic that has been\nrequested many many times by my viewers\nso i decided to do an episode about it\nit's difficult to love without\nattachment but it's extremely important\nto learn to do so this is because if you\ncan't quite bring yourself to love\nwithout attachment then you will either\nresort to games of control\nor resign yourself to the emotional\nrollercoaster\nby loving without attachment you can\nmaintain your peace and serenity and\nenjoy relationships with those who\nfreely choose you in return sounds good\nright so how do you do that\nthe way to love without attachment is\nto treat people\nlike cats\ncats come when they please not when you\ncall them\nand they leave when they want if you try\nto pick up a cat that doesn't want to\nget picked up you're going to get the\nclaws\nand if you don't give attention to a cat\nthat wants it it's going to harass you\nuntil you do\ni like cats because i understand them\nnow where i live in my neighborhood\nthere is a neighborhood cat a siamese\nand the two of us enjoy each other's\ncompany probably at least in part\nbecause i like to put milk out for it\ni'm never really sure when i'll see it\nagain but if i put out good milk the cat\nwill come back cats don't pass up good\nmilk it's in their nature\nso if i put out good milk consistently\nthe cat will come back and will enjoy\neach other's company again it's kind of\nsweet now\nnow\ni have no idea what that cat gets up to\nwhen it's not around but when the cat is\nnot there\ni'm not thinking about it\ni'm not worried about it i'm not\nwondering if it misses me i'm not\nsuspicious that it's at somebody else's\nhouse and that's because i have other\nthings to do with my life\ni'm working on my businesses i'm going\nto the gym i'm spending time with my\nfriends i'm living my life the cat is a\nfun benefit\nwhen it's there i'm with it completely\nfor a pleasant moment and when it's gone\nit disappears entirely from my\nconsciousness\ni'm not waiting for the cat to come back\nbut if i put out good milk it probably\nwill\nnow by now some people are probably\nthinking okay orion but people aren't\ncats you know\npeople have responsibilities and duties\nand obligations and i mean what if that\ncat is out there drinking someone else's\nmilk\nwell here's something to consider\nif that cat is drinking someone else's\nmilk\nthat's not your cat\nthat cat does not belong to you that cat\nbelongs to the neighborhood\ndo you see\nyou have to be very very careful with\nthoughts related to ownership in\nrelationship as this enters into the\nconceptual territory of slavery i don't\nbelieve in slavery i don't think it's\nright or just\nbut you end up with emotional bondage\nbondage is a synonym for slavery when\nyou cannot or will not love without\nattachment\nthink about that it's a sad truth that\nmany people give more love and freedom\nto their pets than to their partners\nand humans need significantly more love\nand freedom than animals do it's just\nharder to give it to them\nat the end of the day even a marriage\nlicense doesn't entitle you to ownership\nof the other person and trust me a\nmarriage license isn't nearly as useful\nat securing a good relationship as is\nconsistently putting out good milk\nback to the metaphor\ncats like milk if you keep putting out\ngood milk the cat will keep coming back\nand if you put out the best milk in the\nneighborhood it will come to your house\nfirst\nnow you can't really control if it goes\nto someone else's house but it will be\nless likely to do so if either it it's\nnot still hungry when it leaves\nand or your milk is so much better than\nany other milk it could get in the\nneighborhood that it kind of puts its\nnose up in the air and passes it by\nand just for the record it's the cat who\ndecides who has the best milk and the\ncat communicates that judgment through\nits actions\nnow\nwhy do i put milk out because i want to\ntrap the cat in a lactose-exclusive\nrelationship\nnot really like i said i like cats i'm a\ncat person i put milk out because i like\ncats i'm not expecting anything in\nreturn the cat will come back in its own\ntime and will enjoy each other's company\nand if it doesn't well\nsome other cat will\nbecause i put out good milk do you see\nin this way by just putting goodness and\nvalue out into the world you will never\nbelong without company\nin some cases people will beat a path to\nyour door\nand those who recognize the value in\nwhat you give will come back every day\nof their own free will because they\ncan't get that milk anywhere else do you\nunderstand it's the best milk around\nand what happens with those you connect\nwith every day\nyou form relationships with them\nand these folks stay in your life\nbecause they choose you every day\nand not because you somehow stop them\nfrom leaving\nbut if for whatever reason you don't see\nthem again\nbe grateful for the good moments that\nyou had wish them well\nand keep putting out good milk\nanother cat will be along presently\nso there are a number of lessons here on\nhow to love without attachment as a\nrecap here are some of them first\nput out good milk\nsecond when the cat isn't there\ngo on with your life\nthird\nbeware of thinking\nthis is my cat and fourth\nget comfortable with the fact that cats\ncome and go in their own time\nthis is how you love without attachment\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand please see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations
