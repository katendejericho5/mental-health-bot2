    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe truth about rejection\nwe're all going to experience rejection\nover the course of our lives in fact\nbecause the universe lives closed which\nis to say that the default answer to any\nquestion in life is no\nwe are going to experience vastly more\nrejection than acceptance in any domain\nof our life personal or professional\nso the sooner that we can understand the\ntruth about rejection the faster we can\ndisabuse ourselves of some of the\nillusions that people maintain about\nthis experience that really obstruct\ntheir overall growth\nso there are three illusions about\nrejection that i want to dispel in\ntoday's episode i call them the three\np's this is the belief that rejection is\npainful\npersonal and\npermanent\npainful personal and permanent the three\nps let's work through each one\nindividually\nthe first illusion about rejection is\nthat it's painful rejection does not\nhave to be painful what i'd like you to\nconsider is that rejection is just\ninformation\nyes is information no is information and\nas i mentioned in the fundamental game\nof human relationships in the game of\nplease know the way someone says no\ncontains a clue contains information\nwith respect to how to potentially get\nthem to say yes\nthe more that you can see no the\nrejection as just a piece of binary data\na zero versus a one\nand the more that you can potentially\nevaluate the quality of that data to\nyour own advantage the more you can take\nthe emotional sting out of rejection\nokay the second is that it's personal in\nthe vast majority of cases it's just not\nmaybe you try to pick up someone at a\nbar and they turn you down or you send\nout a resume to a potential employer\nthey never get back to you\nis this really a personal rejection i\nmean in the first case the person who's\nturning you down has spent all of 60\nseconds in your presence it's not so\nmuch they don't know who you are they\ncan't know who you are they have not had\nanything close to sufficient time to do\nany kind of due diligence with respect\nto your suitability\nso they're really ejecting rejecting\nsome idea of who you are\nnow to be fair there could be some\naspects to your appearance or your words\nor your tone\nthat is contributing to that idea but\nultimately they aren't rejecting you\nbecause they don't know who you are\nsame thing with the employer they're\nrejecting a resume a piece of paper and\nagain maybe there are some things about\nthe presentation of that document that\nyou can improve but there's nothing\npersonal about rejecting a piece of\npaper in the vast majority of cases the\npeople doing the rejecting don't know\nyou well enough to actually reject you\nso it can't possibly be personal\nall right and the third p is that it's\npermanent and this is kind of due to the\nfirst p the painful emotional experience\ncan trigger a catastrophic thought\ncascade and before you know it\nyou're thinking that you're never going\nto get a job you're going to die alone\nor that you're going to be a loser your\nentire life and that's just not true\nthat's the emotional mind talking now\nit's almost certainly true that you will\nneed to experience a great deal of\nrejection before you find a quality\nrelationship or before you find a how a\nhigh value job\nhowever every rejection on some level\njust brings you closer to that eventual\nacceptance it's like that edison quote i\ndidn't fail\ni just found 10 000 ways that won't work\nso rejection is not painful\nit's not personal and it's not permanent\nand if you can dispel these three\nillusions and approach rejection as a\npiece of information capable of guiding\nyou toward your eventual acceptance you\nwill have a much easier time in life\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
