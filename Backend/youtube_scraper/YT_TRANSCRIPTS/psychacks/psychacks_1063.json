    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is three\nsteps to becoming more confident\nso i'm going to begin by offering you my\ndefinition of confidence which basically\ncontains the blueprint that i mentioned\nin the title\nconfidence is the consistent\nfelt experience of success i'll say that\nagain confidence is the consistent\nfelt experience of success\nlet's break that down step one\nyou have to do it\ni mean that's the success part if you\ncan't do it or if you haven't done it\nyet\nhow can you possibly feel realistically\nconfident so the first step is getting\nto the place where you can do it this\nmight mean learning new skills this\nmight mean practicing and rehearsing and\ntraining this might mean investing time\nenergy and money this might mean\nwhatever you need to do\nto get through the pain period as\nquickly and reliably as possible so that\nyou can actually do the thing make sense\nhowever\njust being able to do it\nis not sufficient for the felt sense of\nconfidence\nyou have to be able to do it\nconsistently\nthat's the second step you do it once\nyou might think oh that was just a fluke\nor who i just got lucky if you failed 90\ntimes before you did it once\ncan you really trust that you'll be able\nto do it on demand in the future so you\nhave to do it over and over and over and\nover again so that all things being\nequal you kind of can't not do it or at\nthe very least that you have an\nobjectively better chance of doing it\nthan not doing it got it\nbut even this\nis not enough for the felt sense of\nconfidence for instance i've worked with\nsome very high achieving folks who have\nall kinds of impressive accomplishments\nto their name and some of these folks\nparadoxically enough do not feel very\nconfident at all despite all of their\nvictories\nand why might that be\nbecause these folks are so\nmonomaniac\nperfectionistic\nthat even if they're getting it right 99\npercent of the time\nthey're laser focused on the one percent\nthat they're getting wrong\nas a consequence\nthat's all they see as they move through\nlife and so they end up feeling\nunfulfilled insecure and anxious in the\nmidst of all of their success\nthis brings us to the third crucial step\ntoward the felt sense of confidence you\nhave to take it in\nand how do you do that\nwell every once in a while you have to\nstop\nand you have to look back at how far\nyou've come\nyou've got to really appreciate and\nacknowledge and emotionally spend time\nwith the victories and the growth that\nyou've achieved along the way\nand to allow yourself to cultivate a\njustified sense of pride to feel that as\na consequence of your own efforts and\nyour own perseverance that you've\nactually arrived at something worthwhile\nthat's the final key component to\nfeeling more confident so you have to do\nit you have to do it consistently and\nyou have to allow that to impact you\nemotionally\nthe consistent felt experience of\nsuccess\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
