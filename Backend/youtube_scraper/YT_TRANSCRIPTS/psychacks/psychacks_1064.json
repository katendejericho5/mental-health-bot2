    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to let go of someone\nthe ability to let go of someone is an\nemotional survival technique\ni remember that i was in the wake of a\nsignificant heartbreak many years ago\nthe relationship ended poorly and i was\nexperiencing a whole host of emotions a\nlot of hard feelings mixed up in my\nlonging and desire it was complex\nand for this reason it was very\ndifficult for me to emotionally\ndisentangle myself from the memory of\nthis person\nand i remember going to a good friend\nand mentor and disclosing what i was\ngoing through\nand he told me something that has stuck\nwith me ever since\nhe told me that the only way to let go\nof someone\nis with love\nand i\nreally\ndidn't like hearing that\nand i'll i'll tell you why there was a\npart of me that was still very much\nbound up with the hurt and the pain of\nthat relationship and i didn't love the\nfact that the relationship was over and\nthat it had ended the way that it did\nbut the more i considered what my mentor\ntold me the more i realized that he\nmight actually be right\nnegative emotions kind of cause us to\nemotionally clench\naround the idea or the memory of a\nperson\nand you can't let go of something that\nyou're simultaneously clinging to\nthe way to let go is to soften\nand relax\nthis entails cultivating an attitude of\nlove and compassion relative to the lost\nobject\nregardless of how he or she may have\ntreated you\nregardless of how he or she may have\nhurt you and regardless of how he or she\nmay have ended things\nthe practice is to cultivate gratitude\nfor what good was in the relationship\nand to begin slowly over time to\napproach the idea\nof wishing this person well\nof wanting this person to heal\nof hoping this person does not suffer\njust as you might wish and want and hope\nthose things for yourself or even all\nliving things in buddhism this is called\na loving kindness meditation\nthis is not the same thing as condoning\nwhat happened the idea is to completely\ndivest yourself of the negative emotions\nthat cause you to cling to the lost\nobject\ngentleness is what facilitates\nunclenching it's the soft positive\nemotions like gratitude compassion and\nlove that allow you to unclench to\nactually let go\nand i'm not saying that it's easy\nit's not easy to do that\nbut it's also not easy to live in\npersonal misery as a result of your\nclinging so it's kind of pick your\npoison\nand this one at least gives you the\nchance of potentially saving what's left\nof your life that's what i have to share\nwith you\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
