    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nignorance\nand intelligence\nthese two concepts actually have very\nlittle to do with one another but\nnot in the way that most people think\nfor instance i'm a very intelligent\nperson\nand i'm ignorant about most things\ni can't speak arabic\ni don't know how to lay concrete i\nwouldn't be able to pilot an airplane i\ndon't know what's going on inside your\nhead or even completely what's going on\ninside of my head to be honest\nthe vast majority of things in this\nworld i am completely ignorant of i\ndon't know them i don't know about them\ni don't know how to do them but that\ndoesn't necessarily mean that i'm dumb\nnow\nignorance can cause people to act in\nunintelligent ways but intelligence is\nthe capacity to make use of what\nknowledge you have\nintelligence is pattern recognition it's\ncreativity it's reason it's problem\nsolving\nit's not the same thing\nas knowing something\nnow why am i bringing this up\nbecause in the course of life\nwe will often find ourselves in the\nplace of a student\nwhether we're starting a new course of\nformal study or a new job or entering\ninto a higher level of mastery with new\nthings to consider and challenges to\novercome\nthese are moments when we're more\nconscious than usual that there's a lot\nthat we don't know\nand ignorance can feel very close to us\nand there is a tendency i've seen in\nsome people to over extend that\nignorance into their intellectual\ncapacity\nand just because you don't know\nsomething doesn't mean that you're dumb\nnot knowing is kind of the fundamental\nhuman condition\nand in some cases the smartest thing you\ncan possibly do\nis to indirectly acknowledge that\nignorance and ask a question\nit's actually very intelligent to put\nyourself in the place of a student\nrelative to someone else who has the\nknowledge and the willingness to teach\nyou\nand just because you're their student in\none area doesn't necessarily mean that\nthey wouldn't be your student in another\nso don't take it personally you're\nprobably just as ignorant as i am\nand that doesn't necessarily mean that\nyou're done\nsomething to keep in mind\nwhat do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
