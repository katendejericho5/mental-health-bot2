    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nto be loved\nyou must allow yourself to be known\nthis is extremely important\nit's often the case that by the time we\nenter into full adulthood we've been\nhurt by relationships we've had bad\nbreakups or experienced betrayal or\nsuffered other losses\nand as a consequence there is this\ntendency to sort of emotionally clench\nin new relationships\nin order to protect ourselves from being\nhurt again\nthe fear here is that if someone were to\nknow who we truly were\nand they were to judge us negatively as\na result of that knowledge\nthen not only would they leave us but\ntheir flight would be all the more\npainful because it would be based on an\naccurate observation of who we actually\nwere\nand so to defend against this outcome\nmany people protect themselves from\nreally being seen\nfrom really being known\nunfortunately this is counterproductive\nas it's not possible to love something\nyou don't know about in fact we can only\nlove to the depth of our knowledge\nnoodle on that one for a while\nit's also counterproductive because most\npeople are not going to break out their\nhammer and chisel and work to undo the\nlayers of defensiveness that you've\nconstructed around your heart\nthat might not be how they want to spend\nwhat could very well be their one and\nonly life on this planet so they might\ntry once or twice before moving on to\nsomebody else who might not be so much\nwork so\nin this framework the other person\nleaves either way if you allow yourself\nto be known they might not like what\nthey see and leave and if you don't\nallow yourself to be known they might\nget exacerbated with your defensiveness\nand leave and even if for some strange\nreason the other person were to stick\naround and appreciate you you would\nprobably still feel unsatisfied within\nthat relationship as their appreciation\ncouldn't be based on an accurate\nunderstanding of who you were which\nwould make for a pretty unsatisfying\nrelationship\nand since we apparently can't seem to\nwin\nthat's our clue that we may actually be\nwithin an emotional construct created by\nour past hurts\nas opposed to objective reality allowing\nyourself to be known is a risk and it's\none that should be taken gradually as\nthe relationship develops\nbut it's a risk that is absolutely\nessential for certain kinds of\nrelationships if you want to be loved by\nothers you have to show yourself to them\nso that they have something to love\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
