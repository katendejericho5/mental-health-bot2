    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe nature of evil in games\nso this will be a continuation of a\nprevious episode entitled life and the\nconcept of the game so if you're new to\nthis channel you might want to check out\nthat episode first\nin that episode i described life as a\nseries of nested games and i defined a\ngame as anything with rules and a goal\ntoday i'm going to be talking about the\nnature of evil in the context of this\nframework the concept of the game\nas previously discussed\nwhen there's too much order or too much\nchaos there is death\nonly where the two intersect which is a\ngame\ncan life happen\nthis means on some level the purpose of\nany game\nis to create and maintain the conditions\nthat allow play to continue\nwhile the game is afoot we're alive and\nliving when the game is over we all go\nhome\nso life is associated with the game and\nanything that furthers the game\nis good\nby contrast death is associated with\nanything that ends the game\nand anything that works to end the game\nis evil\nand we all understand this intuitively\nboth chaos and wanton destruction\nand oppression and overreaching control\nare considered evil\nbecause too much of either is not\nconducive to life you can't continue to\nplay and we all know this\nthe question therefore becomes\nif we all know this\nhow does evil exist\nhow does it operate in the world through\nhuman action\nwell\nevil\ndoesn't look evil\nat least in the early stages\nin fact evil kinda has to present itself\nas the good\nor else no one would follow it\nso what does it look like\nin most cases\nwhen it comes to the games that humans\nplay with each other whether in their\nintimate relationships on the stage of\ngeopolitics\nevil looks like this\none side says\nthe stakes are high\nhigher than they've ever been\nwe cannot afford to lose this battle\nif we lose evil will win\ntherefore we are justified in doing\nwhatever is necessary to make the world\nsafe for good\nthis sentence this belief\nis the seed of human evil\nhuman evil is born from the desire to\nmake the world safe for good\nbecause what that belief suggests is\nthat the other side is too dangerous or\ntoo threatening or too evil\nto continue to exist\ntherefore we are justified by the\nnecessity of our actions to oppress and\ncontrol and destroy we have to win\notherwise the game will stop and life as\nwe know it will end\nthe issue is that winning\nbrings the game to an end\nso this thinking is actually in the\nservice of death it's evil thinking\nbut it's hard to see that when you're\nwrapped up in the belief\nironically\nmost\nhuman conflict\nis never truly the battle between good\nand evil\nand that's because generally both sides\nthink they're good\nmost conflicts are a battle between good\nand good\nor at least two perceived goods\nwhich in this framework might actually\nbe a battle between two evils\ntwo forces that want to win the game and\nmake the world safe for itself\nthis situation only creates suffering\nand death through unmitigated\ndestruction or totalitarian control\non the other hand that which is in the\nservice of life\nis anything that allows the play to\ncontinue\nthis thinking is tolerant it's adaptive\nit's strategic and creative\nand if it has to fight its goal is not\nthe total annihilation of the other\nas that would bring the game to the halt\na great example of the force of life in\naction is the process of evolution\nit keeps moving and flowing and adapting\nand that change is essential to the\ncontinuation of life under all kinds of\ncircumstances\nthe upshot is that we have to use our\ndiscernment to carefully examine what is\ngood and what merely looks like it\nand that in the vast majority of cases\nthis town really is big enough for the\ntwo of us\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm please and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
