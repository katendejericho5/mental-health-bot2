    "transcript": "i'm dr orion tarabin and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nfind your ugly duckling\ni did one for the ladies now this one's\nfor the men hey fellas i'm talking to\nyou today and i'm going to share with\nyou what i believe to be an optimal\ndating strategy with respect to finding\na suitable female partner\nas a guy i know that we're primarily\nattracted to physical attributes and you\nknow what god bless it there's nothing\nquite like a beautiful woman right\nhowever this priority can really get a\nguy into trouble\nnow i'm 39 years old and i've dated many\nmany women in my life including some\nthat i would consider nines and tens\nlike internationally gorgeous women\nand while this wasn't universally the\ncase\nmany of those women\nwere extremely difficult to be in a\nrelationship with for a variety of\nreasons\none of them we could call a sense of\nentitlement\ni remember i was once in a relationship\nwith a woman she was 25 years old at the\ntime and she told me i was the first man\nwho had ever told her no\ncan you imagine\nwhat that would do to a person\nbeing an incredibly beautiful woman\nis kind of the equivalent of being some\nbillionaire scion\nyou just grow up with this extremely\ndistorted view of life in other people\ndo you think folks like this typically\nhave the emotional intelligence let\nalone the distress tolerance to enter\ninto a normal give and take relationship\ni mean temper tantrums are not a good\nlook at any age but they are really ugly\nat 25 or 35 for that matter here's\nanother reason\nit's often the case that when women\nblossom earlier in life they can receive\nthe kind of attention and priority that\ndisincentivizes them from developing\nother aspects of themselves their\npersonality their interests their skills\ntheir career\nthe kinds of things that make them good\nand interesting and lovable and the\nkinds of things that make it easier to\nhave a relationship with them and let me\ntell you the older i get the more\neffortlessness in a relationship matters\nto me i have a lot going on\nand the woman i'm looking for needs to\nbe able to seamlessly integrate herself\ninto that frame the more friction there\nis the more the relationship draws time\nenergy and attention away from the great\nthings that we both could otherwise be\nexperiencing you get what i'm saying\nso man\nmy advice to you\nis to look for your ugly duckling\nthis is an allusion to that hans\nchristian anderson story about a\nweird-looking duck who grew up to be a\nbeautiful swan\nsome women blossom at different stages\nin life\nand i've dated some very very attractive\nwomen who didn't really come into their\nown into their late 20s or even their\nearly 30s\ni know this because i've i've seen their\npictures and i honestly think they're\nbetter looking today than they were 10\nyears ago\nand these women have all been\nsignificantly easier\nand more satisfying to relate to than\nthe nines and tens they are still plenty\nattractive\nbut they frankly just have more to offer\nthan their looks\nto find an ugly duckling you need to pay\nattention to her stories maybe she never\nhad a boyfriend in high school where she\nwas reserved in college this can mean\nthat she was devoting time and energy to\ndeveloping herself or some other\ncharacter building exercise like\nstarting a business or caring for a\nloved one\nit also likely means that she doesn't\ntake male attention for granted\ni get it some of those instagram girls\nare total smoke shows however if you're\ngoing after a woman like that get ready\nto compete with 10 000 other guys and\nnow you have the same problem as the\nwomen that are hanging out at the\nwinner's circle\nit's probably not gonna work out and you\ncould waste a good deal of time energy\nand money in the process\nyour attention will also not be valuable\nto one of those women but it might be to\nan ugly duckling now\nobviously you need to be authentically\nattracted to this woman that's the\nbeautiful swan part of the story but a\nlate blooming\nafter a potentially awkward character\ndevelopment phase can be a very positive\nsign for mate selection this kind of\nforces her to develop other parts of\nherself independent of her looks and it\nincreases the value of your attention\nand relationship\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
