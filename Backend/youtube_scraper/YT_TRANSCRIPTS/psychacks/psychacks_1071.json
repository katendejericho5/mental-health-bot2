    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nlove\nsex\nand commitment\nthese three concepts are\ncompletely independent of each other\nlove does not guarantee sex or\ncommitment\nsex does not guarantee love or\ncommitment and commitment does not\nguarantee sex or love you can have none\nof these\nall of these or most commonly some\ncombination of these\nhowever understanding that the existence\nof one does not imply the existence of\nthe others should help to reduce the\namount of unnecessary suffering in\nrelationships\nin this episode i'm going to run through\nthe eight different possible\ncombinations of these factors using\nexamples from cinema to illustrate each\nso if you want to learn more about these\nvarious types of relationships go watch\nthe movie i'll also note that i'm basing\nsome of these concepts on robert\nsternberg's triangular theory which used\nthe concepts of intimacy passion and\ndecision to reflect similar combinations\nso let's give credit where credit is due\nlet's get to it\nthe first possibility is that you have\nnone of those things no sex no love no\ncommitment in film this person is often\ndepicted as some sort of strange weirdo\nlike travis bickle in taxi driver or a\npitiable buffoon like andy stitzer in\nthe 40 year old virgin however that's\nnot really quite fair because this is\npretty much everybody's starting point\nso if you're in this stage chances are\nyou're still a young person early on in\nthe process don't worry that will change\nnext let's say you have sex\nno love no commitment\nthis is hookup culture and i think this\nis best exemplified in the movie fight\nclub in the relationship between tyler\ndurden and marla singer tyler treats\nthis woman like crap and to be fair she\nkind of enjoys it which is interesting\nand they obviously have no explicit\ncommitment to each other but they do\nhave riotous epic sexual escapades and\nthat's what their relationship is about\nthen you can have love\nwithout sex or commitment\nthis is often unrequited love or a\nstrong mutual friendship one of the best\nexamples of this is in the movie in the\nmood for love in which the male\nprotagonist falls in love with a woman\nwho is married to another man she\nactually reciprocates the feeling and\nthey kind of have an emotional affair\nbut it's never consummated and she\nultimately decides to remain with her\nhusband\nnext you can have commitment\nbut no love or sex\na lot of marriages actually end up here\nnot so fun fact around 20 of american\nmarriages are considered sexless\naccording to the national health and\nsocial life survey a great example of\nthis is in the relationship between\nlester and carolyn burnham in american\nbeauty\nthey're married to each other but\nthey're clearly not happy and they're\nobviously not having sex at least with\neach other the relationship kind of\nfalls apart in an arguably beneficial\nway when the two start being more honest\nwith each other and with themselves\nokay\nnow let's move on to the next level\nwhere you get two out of the three\nlet's say you have sex and love\nbut no commitment\nthis\nis modern day romance remember the\nromantic sect was opposed the catholic\nsacrament of marriage though they\nweren't big on sex either to be fair\nhence modern day romance a great example\nof this is the relationship between jack\nand enos in brokeback mountain those two\nguys loved each other they went on their\nfishing trips together but they were\nmarried to other women it's a common\nromantic plot\nnext\nis love and commitment but no sex\nthis is generally known as companionate\nlove it's the kind of love that's\nromanticized in the idea of growing old\ntogether\nsitting on the porch holding hands and\nbasking in the warmth of your sweet and\nwholesome love a great example of this\nis norman and ethel in on golden pond\nit's sweet and endearing though the\npassion has long since gone out of the\nrelationship\nnext is sex and commitment but no love\nthere are a few different forms this\ncombination can take but the most common\none is a tumultuous and whirlwind\nromance in which two people who don't\nknow each other very well and may not\neven like each other very much can't\nkeep their hands off each other and rush\nto get married a fantastic example of\nthis relationship\nis in the french classic la atalante in\nwhich the newly married couple\nfight and make up to fight and make up\nand last but not least is all three\nwhich you might call ideal love i'm\ngonna be real with you this one is\nreally hard to get in real life\nmost people are gonna end up with two\nout of three for the better part of\ntheir lives\nso pick your poison\nand there also aren't a lot of great\nexamples of this in cinema most likely\nbecause the story of a loving committed\nand passionate relationship doesn't make\nfor good drama\nwhat when these relationships do show up\nin film it's usually in the early part\nof the movie and then something happens\nand the protagonist loses access to that\nrelationship which kind of serves as\ncharacter motivation for the rest of the\nfilm\na good example of this is the\nrelationship between tom and edie in a\nhistory of violence\nwhen we first meet tom played by vigo\nmortensen he's married to a beautiful\nwife and has a couple of kids edie loves\nhim and their peaceful little life and\nshe even dresses up in her old high\nschool cheerleading uniform for him\nthere's even this point in the movie\nwhere he's like looking at her in that\nuniform and he's thinking i'm the\nluckiest guy in the world what did i do\nwhat did i do to deserve the situation\nand then of course something happens in\nthe film and all this is jeopardized\nwhich creates the dramatic thrust of the\nfilm\nso remember\nlove sex and commitment are independent\nconcepts the presence of one does not\nimply the existence of the others and\nthe examples i've given you all come\nfrom great movies that deserve to be\nwatched in their own right i hope you\nfound this useful what do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cychaxpodcast gmail.com thanks
