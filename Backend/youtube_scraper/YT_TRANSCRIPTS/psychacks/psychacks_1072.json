    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nan update to the gift of your absence\nso this video the gift of your absence\nis the video that most likely brought\nyou to this channel it now has over 100\n000 views and it is by far my most\nwatched episode and so i thought at this\nmilestone that i would release a brief\nupdate to that video\nfirst of all i'd like to say thank you\nso much\nfor taking an interest in what i have to\nsay\nit's actually pretty rare for people to\ncare about your thing\nand i'm very very grateful for your\nsupport\nlet's keep growing the channel together\nnow i want to take this opportunity to\nclear up a few points of potential\nconfusion that may have arisen from that\nvideo\nfirst and foremost i want to emphasize\nthat the primary goal of giving people\nthe gift of your absence\nis not to encourage people to chase\nafter you in some indirect or\nmanipulative way\nthis can happen\nbut it's best if this is not the primary\nintention behind doing this if for no\nother reason that we're not as cunning\nas we think and people generally react\npoorly to feeling manipulated it's a\nstrategy that often backfires\nthe fundamental goal\nof giving people the gift of your\nabsence\nis to increase your own self value by\nexercising self-respect\nit's demeaning in the long run to remain\nin a relationship whether it's personal\nor professional where you feel\nconsistently undervalued life really is\ntoo short for that\nso we model for others how to respect us\nby first and foremost respecting\nourselves\nnow\npulling back also generally increases\nperceived value this is economics 101\npeople i didn't make this up scarcity\ncreates value\nso if you shown up well in a\nrelationship whether you're a good\nworker or a great wife or a good friend\nand you make your presence scarcer\nregardless of how you've been treated in\nthe past this will tend to increase your\nperceived value in that relationship\nhowever i'd like you to consider that\nthis is kind of an extra bonus\nthat comes with increasing your own\nself-value by exercising self-respect\nand whether you ought to put too much\nstock in whether someone who has\nconsistently undervalued you suddenly\nhas a change of heart is another story\nlike any other gift you shouldn't give\nthe gift of your absence with strings\nattached\nso do this for you\nnow\na criticism that a few people have\nleveled at this strategy is that it's\npassive aggressive\nand i can kind of see how pulling back\nor not responding could be seen in that\nlight\nhowever i'm going to respectfully\ndisagree with that assessment\nif done properly the gift of your\nabsence is neither passive nor\naggressive it's certainly not passive i\nmean in this case you're taking steps to\nremove yourself from the relationship\nthat's active not passive\nand it shouldn't be aggressive there's\nno door slamming or name calling or\nbackhanded snipes otherwise your absence\nwouldn't be a gift\nit would be a relief\nthe intention isn't to hurt someone else\nthe intention is to stop hurting\nyourself\nby remaining in an actively antagonistic\nrelationship\nto me it would be passive aggressive to\nremain in that relationship\nand withdraw emotionally or refuse to\ntalk with them or some such thing you\nsee the difference\nit's also important to keep in mind that\ngenerally when people decide to leave a\njob or leave a relationship\nit's not the first thing that they tried\nby the time they've gotten to this point\nthey've spoken with their boss or had\nmultiple conversations with their\npartner and have tried any number of\nstrategies to communicate their\ndissatisfaction and distress\npeople typically don't say okay bye\nthe first time things go sideways\nso we kind of have to assume that people\nhave arrived at this strategy because\nnothing else has worked\nand expecting that you're somehow going\nto get through to somebody when nothing\nelse has worked by sticking around\nis lunacy\nlike i say in my episode to hope is to\nwait if you're going to wait you need to\nhave a reasonable hope of obtaining the\ndesired outcome through patience\nand if you've exhausted all these other\noutcomes you do not have that hope and\non some level you owe it to yourself to\ntake yourself out of that relationship\nwhatever it may be\nfinally i did get a number of people\nreaching out to me asking well what if\nyou live with this person what if you\ncan't otherwise avoid this person what\ndo you do then\nand unfortunately the answer is you\ncan't give such people the full gift of\nyour absence under these circumstances\nbut there are things you can do to make\nyour life more bearable and i'll make\nanother episode on how to handle those\nsituations in the future\nso\nthanks again for your interest here's\nthe next 100 000.\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
