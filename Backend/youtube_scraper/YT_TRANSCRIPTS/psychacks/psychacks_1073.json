    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwe'll see\nthis is a real simple mind hack that\ni've developed to guard myself against\ndisappointment and frustration look i\ntalk to people for a living and as a\nconsequence of spending tens of\nthousands of hours in conversation with\nother people\ni can tell you\nthat you shouldn't put too much faith in\nwhat people say\npeople will say things and they won't\nfollow through\nor they'll follow through for a time and\nthen drop it entirely\nthey'll tell me they want one thing but\nthey'll chase something completely\ndifferent\npeople are not always honest with me\nbecause they're not always honest with\nthemselves and to a certain extent this\nis inevitable because we all have blind\nspots but my point here is that you\nshould basically take everything people\nsay with a grain of salt\nif someone tells me that they're going\nto do something my emotional reaction is\nlike oh\nthank god relief they're finally gonna\ndo it yay victory\nwhen someone tells me they're gonna do\nsomething i say to myself\nwe'll see\nunless the person has exceptionally high\nintegrity the fact that that verbal\ncommitment occurred is actually no\nguarantee of future action\nall know that somebody has actually made\nthe commitment when their behavior\naligns with that commitment over time\nand until i see that behavioral\nalignment i'm going to withhold judgment\nas to whether or not this behavior is\nactually going to occur\ni don't doubt people per se\ni don't roll my eyes and think uh yeah\nright you're full of it\ni don't doubt them\nbut i don't really trust them either\ni don't take their their verbal\ncommitment as proof of their inevitable\nbehavioral alignment both my doubt and\nmy trust are earned\nby watching whether people do what they\nsay they're going to do\nand because i kind of neither trust nor\ndoubt words\ni often\ndon't feel disappointed or frustrated\nwith other people\nso take what people say with a grain of\nsalt when someone says that something is\ngoing to happen or it's not going to\nhappen mentally say we'll see\nuntil you have consistent behavioral\nconfirmation that aligns with that\ncommitment\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
