    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how women\nmake it difficult to love them so this\none is for the ladies ladies I'm here to\nhelp you if you are not interested in\nhaving more love in your life then this\nis not the episode for you you can\nkindly move on but for those of you who\nare still listening I'm going to teach\nyou how you can get more love in your\nlife it's actually very simple it will\ncost you nothing and you can start today\nwith what you already have sound good as\nI often do I'm going to begin by first\nextrapolating an analogy with the\nprofessional world and then\ndemonstrating how that mirrors what\noccurs in a romantic relationship why\nbecause people are generally so much\nmore rational in understanding when it\ncomes to business and the fact of the\nmatter is that what tends to work in one\ntends to work in the other in any case\nCas in this scenario let's pretend that\nyou're running a business as a result\nI'll assume that you'd be interested in\nmaking more money more sales for your\nproduct more clients for your service to\nthat end as the business owner you will\nneed to ensure that it's easy for your\ncustomers to part with their money like\nif you're selling a product you don't\nwant there to be more than three clicks\ninvolved in that funnel\nit's like add to cart fill in my little\ncredit card security code and buy now\nboom that's it the more streamlined and\nintuitive you make that process the more\nmoney is going to come your way it's not\na good idea to put obstacles between\nyour customers and your accounts\nreceivable I mean how do you feel when\ncompanies make this process difficult\nit's like buy\nplease what\nI have to make an account first uh okay\nI\nguess but they're asking for my credit\ncard now oh so they're going to auto\nbill me later gez okay fine I'll just\nmake a reminder to cancel the membership\nbefore it renews all right what now they\nneed to verify my identity so I have to\nupload an ID Jesus okay H I think I have\na pick on my phone somewhere oh it has\nto be scanned no pictures accepted okay\n this it it's not it anymore\nand you're going to go find a comparable\ngood that you can acquire without all\nthis\nrigoll now\nimagine if this same company then looked\nat its balance sheets and then blamed\nits customers for its\nRevenue well if they really liked our\nproducts then they would have found a\nway to make it work if they wanted to\nthey would and since they didn't I guess\nthey didn't really want to so next I\nmean how difficult is it to a driver's\nlicense you'd think we'd make some kind\nof unreasonable request here but how\nelse are we supposed to verify someone's\nidentity so they can make an account to\nbuy a membership to have access to our\nproducts G\ncustomers like can you imagine can you\nimagine mistaking your complex business\nfunnel for your customer's lack of\nInterest I'll say that one again can you\nimagine mistaking your complex business\nfunnel for your customer's lack of\nInterest\nthat would be wild wouldn't it\nparadoxically the only business that\ncould possibly get away with something\nlike this is the one that is so in\ndemand that is it perceives such high\ninterest in its customers that it\nactually needs to create obstacles to\nslow down the transaction process so\nthat it isn't overwhelmed and most\nbusinesses ain't got that problem do you\nunderstand as I discussed at length in\nanother episode a bad business blames\nits customers if you want things do not\nmake it difficult for people to give you\nsaid things because that would be\nstupid now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow I'm also proud to announce\nthat I'll soon be publishing my book the\nvalue of others so if you'd like to\nlearn more about that you can go on my\nwebsite and sign up for my Weekly\nNewsletter finally please fill out an\ninqu PRI form on my website if you're\nlooking to book a paid consultation the\nlink is in the description all right\nlet's get back to it now the same\nprinciple applies to relationships\nladies let's say that instead of money\nyou want to receive more love in your\nlife just like a successful business you\nneed to work to make the point of\ntransaction streamlined and intuitive a\nlot of you ladies create these really\ncomplex and elaborate funnels that make\nit harder and harder for you to receive\nthe love that you say that you want and\njust like the business with the\ncomplicated sales funnel that is\nultimately to your detriment for\ninstance I have heard women say that\nthey felt unloved when a man didn't read\na book she recommended or when he didn't\nnotice her new manicure or when he\ndidn't want to watch a show with her or\nwhen he wouldn't listen to her problems\nwithout offering Solutions or or when he\ndidn't let her pick the side of the bed\nin the hotel room or when he took her to\na place he once took his ex-girlfriend\nor when he infantilized her by doing\nthings for her or when he abandoned her\nby not doing things for her or etc etc\netc these frustrations and\ndisappointments reveal a complex\nevolving and often unconscious system of\nrequirements a woman is subject to\nimposing on her relationships for\ninstance if we were to work backwards it\nwould suggest that an order for this\nwoman to feel loved which presumably is\nsomething that she wants she needs a man\nto read her book recommendations notice\nher manicure watch her shows listen to\nher problems without offering Solutions\nlet her pick her side of the bed take\nher only to places he has never taken\nanyone else do certain things for her\nnot do certain other things for her and\nbe able to know the difference between\nthose two categories all this does is\nunnecessarily complicate her love funnel\nwhich will absolutely result in her\nreceiving less love not more and if she\nwere to go one further and blame the man\nfor his inability or unwillingness to\nnavigate this\ncomplexity then she is going to have a\ntough time out there a business that\noperated like that would not have a very\nbright\nfuture and I don't think anyone else is\ntelling women this like there are so\nmany things in popular psychology that\nseem to validate and support this kind\nof complexity like take love languages\nthe construct of Love Languages\nfortifies the idea that complexity is\nnot only normal but should be\naccommodated it is the emotional\nequivalent of a business saying that it\nonly accepts Albanian Lex and American\nExpress now businesses can do whatever\nthey want but functionally insisting\nthat its customers change their currency\nor open a new line of credit just to do\nbusiness with them will absolutely\nresult in less Revenue not more on the\nother hand a business that is interested\nin making money will go out of its way\nto accept an Ever growing diversity of\npayments cash credit personal checks\ncryptocurrency bartering like\nbring me a basket of apples and we're\ngood all of the things being equal that\nbusiness is going to make more money\nbecause it has made it easier for its\ncustomers to part with that\nmoney and we all kind of already knew\nthat love languages were anyway\nif for no other reason that they are so\ninconsistently applied like the same\nwoman who insists on certain forms of\nLove payment from her husband is not\ngoing to insist on those forms of Love\npayment from her children like while I\nappreciate the crayon drawing of me\nsweetie you should understand that\nmommy's more of an ax of service kind of\ngirl moving forward like a good mother\nmakes it easy for her children to love\nher and sees the value of that love in\ntheir\nintentions not in her prefer\na good woman does the same for her\nman ladies if you've created a situation\nin your minds that require people to do\ncertain things in order for you to feel\ncertain ways you've really made it that\nmuch more difficult for anyone to love\nyou and that's obviously not to your\nbenefit it's a better idea to simplify\nthe process by which you receive love\nand to increase the forms in which you\naccept Love Don't don't make it\ndifficult for people to give you what\nyou want and you will get more of it\ntrust me what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and
