    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nyou can only get better\nthis is good news my friends the\npressure is off\nwhenever you do over and over again\nyou will get better at\nit's literally not possible to do\nsomething over and over again and get\nworse at it\nthis proposition requires neither hope\nnor faith it's simply an attribute of\nthe way that we are constructed for\ninstance you don't have to hope that\nlifting a heavy thing over your head\nover and over again will make you\nstronger it absolutely will even if you\nhave no positive expectation that it\nwill it's just the way things work\nthe flip side of this however\nis that you can get better\nat the wrong thing\nthis is because the principle of\nreinforcement through repetition\nis value neutral\nwhatever you do over and over again you\nwill get better at so we have to be very\nvery careful about what we do over and\nover again if you're not careful you can\nget better at avoiding\nprocrastinating\nlying\nbinging\nbreaking your word letting yourself off\nthe hook\netc\ni know some master procrastinators i\nknow some expert avoiders\nand they've arrived at these specialties\nlike anyone else through consistent\npractice\nthe key is to be mindful of the small\nthings\nthis is because any time we do something\nwe make that behavior just slightly\neasier to do the next time around\nwhich makes it just slightly more likely\nthat the person will choose that\nbehavior again when conditions are met\nand over time in repetition that's how\nvery firm pathways are created in our\nminds for good or bad\nfor instance\none cigarette does not give people lung\ncancer\nso people think what's the harm in one\ncigarette it's not the end of the world\nand people relent to the small vice well\nthat's true one cigarette won't kill you\nbut it's not exactly harmless either and\nthe harm is precisely that it makes the\nsecond\ncigarette a stronger possibility and the\nsecond makes the third an even stronger\npossibility and that's how bad habits\nare constructed\non the other hand\none push-up does not make you strong so\npeople think what's the point of doing\none push-up it's not going to make any\ndifference at all so people neglect the\nsmall virtue\nwell\nthat's true too one push-up won't make\nyou strong but it's not exactly\nworthless either and its worth is\nprecisely that it makes the second\npush-up easier and the second makes the\nthird even easier than that and so on\nand that's how good habits are built\nwhat's the upshot it's the small things\nthat create the big lasting habits of\nour life\nso don't neglect the harmless or the\nworthless behaviors that you repeat\nbecause whatever you do over and over\nagain\nyou will get better at what do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cycact's podcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
