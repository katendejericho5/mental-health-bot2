    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nstop having panic attacks without\nmedication this will be the second part\nof my talk on the subject so if you\nhaven't done so already you might want\nto check out part one before continuing\nso\nwhere were we\nbasically we were discussing how panic\ndisorder is a dysfunction in the\nmechanism of attention\nthe intention to protect yourself from\npanic attacks leads to checking behavior\nwhich leads to finding the signs of\nearly onset panic which are disturbed\nand intensified by our attention which\nare interpreted and validated in a\nhighly negative light now all of this\ncan happen very very quickly but it\nalways happens in that sequence of\nevents\non some level panic attacks are actually\na completely self-created problem which\ni guess is a good thing because if it's\nself-created we can self-solve it now\nhow do we do that\nfirst and foremost\nyou need to stop checking\nthis is hard to do but it's absolutely\nessential you have to stop checking your\npulse or taking your temperature or\nfeeling for the tightness in your chest\nor whatever it is you do to determine\nwhether you're experiencing the early\nonset symptoms of a panic attack you\nhave to stop checking\nthere's going to be this impulse to go\nand check but you're going to have to\nblock it it's just like a craving to use\nor to engage in a bad habit do something\nelse and the impulse will pass and this\nis important because if you don't check\nthen the whole process that i just\ndescribed gets nipped in the bud it just\ndoesn't move forward\nall right but let's say you do check\nand you find something abnormal now what\ndo you do\nwell in that case the best thing you can\ndo\nis to try to disrupt the catastrophic\nthought cascade that leads to the\nfluorescence of the panic attack as\nquickly as possible you can do this by\ndistracting yourself a great way to\ndistract yourself is to use the serial\nsevens technique you can check out my\nepisode on serial sevens if you want to\nknow more about this\nor you could name all the capitals of\neurope or you could translate a song\ninto another language or you could jump\nin a cold shower or you could mindfully\nattend to your environment anything to\nget you out of your head or to disrupt\nthe process from moving on to the next\nstep\nall right but let's say you checked and\nyou didn't distract yourself and now\nyou're starting to feel your racing\nheart or your rising temperature and\nyou're aware of your negative judgment\noh this is bad i'm starting to have a\npanic attack oh boy well you can\nintervene here as well\nthe best way to do that is to attack the\ninterpretation using the block and\nreplace technique and you can check out\nmy episode on the block and replace\ntechnique if you want to know more about\nthis\nfor instance you could say no\nit's not true that i'm having a heart\nattack i've experienced this before\nit's normal for heart rate to be\nvariable sometimes my heart is beating\nslower sometimes my heart is beating\nfaster this is one of those times it\nwill go away by itself in a few minutes\nit's perfectly fine this has happened\nbefore and i was fine before too long\nso\ndon't check\ndistract yourself as quickly as possible\nand block and replace any negative\njudgments about what's happening to you\nand if for whatever reason the ball\nslips by all three of these goalies\nthen you're in emotional coping mode now\nand you just need to do what you can to\nmitigate the damage\nthat might mean putting on some soft\nmusic\nwrapping yourself in a nice warm blanket\nor having a cup of like herbal tea\nwhatever you need to do\nto make yourself feel safe and\ncomfortable and then allow the process\nto take its course\nnow\nit's normal in the course of treatment\nfor panic attacks to continue to happen\na few times as you get better at\nmastering these techniques but generally\nwithin a few weeks to a few months\na person can with sufficient discipline\nbreak the dysfunctional pattern of\nattention that undergirds the mechanism\nof panic attacks so that they stop\nhappening entirely\nthis has been true in my own life and\nit's been true in the lives of dozens of\nthe people i've worked with on this very\nproblem\ni hope you found this helpful feel free\nto send this to someone who might need\nto hear it and remember to like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
