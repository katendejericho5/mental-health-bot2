    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to stop having panic attacks without\nmedication\nthis is hard to summarize in just five\nminutes so this will be the first of two\nepisodes on the subject as a\npsychologist i've helped dozens of folks\nstop having panic attacks the process\ngenerally takes two to three months and\nit can be done without resorting to\nanti-anxiety medications and this is\ngreat because those medications well\nbeneficial in some respects\nalso come with a host of liabilities and\nshould be used very sparingly if at all\ni've also personally suffered from panic\nattacks so i know what they're like and\ni know how terrifying and awful the\nexperience can be\ni really wouldn't wish them on anybody\nand so the strategies that i'm going to\ntalk about in these videos have worked\nfor me personally and have worked for\nmany of my patients so here goes\nwhat i'd like you to consider\nis that panic disorder is fundamentally\na dysfunction\nin the mechanism of your attention it's\nan attention problem\nwhat do i mean by that\nwell\nusually the first time you have a panic\nattack it seems to come out of the blue\nand it's extremely terrifying and\nupsetting\nand after experiencing that people are\nunderstandably anxious about the\nprospect of the panic attack returning\nthey don't want it to come back\nand since they don't really know what\ncaused the first one they basically\nbelieve that it could return at any\nmoment so they're kind of constantly on\nthe lookout for signs that the panic\nattack is coming back\nso what they do\nis they engage in checking behavior\nrelative to the early onset symptoms of\npanic attacks\nfor me personally\nmy early onset symptom was that my heart\nwould start to race so my checking\nbehavior was that i would check my pulse\na lot\nfor other people it's a feeling of being\nhot so they check their temperature or\nfeel their forehead do you understand\nnow\nthis checking behavior is motivated by a\ndesire to keep us safe\nto kind of reassure ourselves the panic\nattack isn't happening\nor to prepare ourselves in the event\nthat it is\nbut here's the issue with this\nwhat we go looking for\nwe find\nif your doctor performs a number of\ntests on you it's highly likely that at\nleast one result will come back abnormal\neven if you're otherwise perfectly\nhealthy\nso if you go looking for early onset\nsymptoms of panic attacks you are going\nto find early onset symptoms of panic\nattacks\nand what makes this even more\nproblematic\nis that when we pay attention to our\nnatural unconscious physiological\nprocesses we change them\nas a way of demonstrating this\ni'd like you to take a moment and just\nnotice your breath\nyou see\nyou changed the way that you were\nbreathing whether you wanted to or not\nyou were breathing smoothly and\nregularly just a moment ago when your\nbreathing was unconscious and when you\nbrought your conscious attention to your\nbreath you changed the way that you were\nbreathing and this change could be\nconsidered an abnormality in the context\nof your normal functioning\nand what makes this most problematic is\nthat when we attend to these changes\nwe increase the intensity of those\nchanges\ni'd like you to consider that attention\nis like a magnifying glass\nwhatever we attend to gets bigger\nand the more we attend to it the more it\nfills the container of our consciousness\nand the more that's all we see\nfinally we have the cherry on top\nthe attribution that this intensified\nabnormality brought on by our checking\nis something very negative it's a\njudgment like oh no my heart is racing\nthe panic attack is starting again i'm\nhaving another panic attack or even this\nis bad\ni'm having a heart attack\nif you validate this attribution with\nyour belief then congratulations you've\njust given yourself a panic attack\nso that's the recipe for a panic attack\nwe constantly check for signs the panic\nattack is about to return\nin the act of checking we change our\nunconscious physiological processes such\nthat they're more likely to now be\nabnormal\nby attending to that abnormality we\nincrease its intensity\nwe interpret the meaning of that\nintensified abnormality in a highly\nnegative light and finally\nwe believe our own interpretation is\ntrue\nso\nnow you should understand why i call\npanic disorder an attention disorder\nparadoxically it's through our efforts\nto keep ourselves safe that we put\nourselves in harm in harm's way\nand now that we understand what this is\ni'll talk about more what to do about it\nin the second part of this talk\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
