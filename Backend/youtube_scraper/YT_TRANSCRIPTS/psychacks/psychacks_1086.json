    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\npeople are as happy as they choose to be\nhappiness is a choice\nit's based on an internal turning toward\nreality as enough\nso when we decide to predicate our\nhappiness on external conditions\nthree things happen\nwe disempower ourselves\nwe rob ourselves of the potential for\njoy in that present moment and we enter\ninto games of control\nwhy is this true\nfirst if you believe that your happiness\ndepends on external conditions whatever\nthey may be\nthen you are complicit in enshrining\nthose conditions as masters over you and\nas your masters they will now be capable\nof either providing or withholding what\nyou desire which is a very disempowering\nposition to be in\nand this position can cause people to\nact in desperate or degrading ways it's\nnot something that you want\nsecond\nit robs you of the potential inherent in\nthe present moment\nthe core component of happiness is\ncontentment\nwhich is a turning toward the present\nmoment as enough that's it\nthat's all that's required to be content\nand that makes sense think about it\nif you needed certain external things in\norder to be happy then happiness as an\nexperience would have been inherently\nimpossible throughout the vast majority\nof human history when those external\nthings simply did not yet exist\nif happiness were predicated on external\ncircumstances then the vast majority of\nhuman beings even today would not be\ncapable\nof being happy and that's not the world\ni observe\nand finally\nit forces you to enter into games of\ncontrol\nif you believe that your happiness\ndepends on external conditions well\nthen you're going to do all that you can\nto make external reality which generally\ninvolves other people conform to your\npreferences\nand this is something that is both\nexpensive and ineffective\nit's kind of like making water flow\nupstream you can do it\nbut it takes a lot of energy\nso it's generally more effective to work\nwith the current of the river than it is\nto work against it\ninstead you can choose to approach\nhappiness by turning toward the present\nmoment as enough\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
