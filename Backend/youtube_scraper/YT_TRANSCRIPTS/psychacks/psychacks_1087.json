    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nrelationships and the concept of the\ngame\nthis is another continuation of my\nepisodes entitled life in the concept of\nthe game and the fundamental game of\nhuman relationships so if you're new to\nthe channel you might want to start\nthere\nlook\nif anything\nwith a goal and a set of rules is a game\nthen relationships are a game\nwhy\nbecause when you enter into a\nrelationship with another human being\nyou want something\nthat is your goal\nit could be sex or money or friendship\nor connection or competition or a loving\ncommitted relationship or just a\ncompanion to pass the time i'm not here\nto judge but in every case you're going\nto another person because you want\nsomething from that person\nand whether you like it or not there is\na set of rules associated with how to\nattain that desired thing for instance\nit would not be possible\nto win the game of a loving secure\nfamily\nif you were say an active abusive\nalcoholic\nif you sow chaos and destruction\nyou cannot create stable loving bonds\nwith others by definition it's just not\nphysically or should we say\npsychologically possible\nand if you can't act however you want to\nget whatever you want then there must be\nrules to getting what you want whether\nyou like it or not\nso relationships are games because they\nare goals plus rules\nnow when i talk about the game of\nrelationships or the game of attraction\nthe most common piece of negative\nfeedback i generally receive is\nsomething like oh god i'm so tired of\ngame playing i just i'm just sick of it\nit's so immature\nit's like grow up it's a waste of my\ntime i don't play games and i don't\nspend time with other people who play\ngames just be honest and straight up\nwhat's so hard about that\nokay\nfair enough\nbut my point is that relationships are\ninescapably games\nbecause they are goals plus rules they\ncan't not be games\nand this approach to relationships of\nbeing forthright and sincere and direct\nand authentic\nis\na strategy\nin the game of relationships\nit's one way that people have developed\nto get what they want from other people\nit's kind of like you know certain car\ndealerships that make a big point of\nadvertising they don't do negotiation\npeople are nervous about negotiating the\nprice of a car so we don't do that we\njust put our best offer on the sticker\nand what you see is what you get no\nstress no pressure just straight talk\nand fair dealing and that\nis a strategy\nto attract customers to buy cars and it\nmust work at least some of the time\notherwise that strategy wouldn't exist\nas those dealerships would quickly go\nout of business\nnow to say that car dealers are sincere\nhonest and authentic would be a little\ndisingenuous\nthey've adopted that strategy for a\nreason\nand we can see that it is a strategy\nbecause we can imagine these dealers\nlike consciously choosing to do this\nthe issue is that in the game of\nrelationships\nmost people don't experience their\nsincerity their authenticity their\nhonesty\nas a strategy\nbecause they don't think of these things\nas something they've consciously chosen\nto do in order to achieve a goal\nbut if it's the case that we're playing\ngames whether we're aware of them or not\nthen the things we do to obtain our\ngoals don't always have to be conscious\nstrategies\nthink about it\nmost of the things that we do\nwe don't really know why we do them\nbut if we were to examine that behavior\nobjectively we would generally discover\nthat we do them because they've been\nreinforced in some way in the past and\nwe believed they would be effective in\nthe present\nbut this belief and this reinforcement\nmore often than not occurs below the\nthreshold of awareness\nour choices are not always conscious\nbut they are our choices\nso what's the takeaway my point here is\nthat being honest and direct in\nrelationships doesn't mean you're not\nplaying games it means that you believe\nthat being honest and direct is your\nbest bet of getting what you want\nwhich means that you're playing games as\nmuch as the dishonest an indirect person\nis\nthese are just two different ways of\ngoing about getting what you want from\nother people and in general\nhonesty and directness can be very good\nstrategies\nin the game of human relationship\nthough other strategies have their place\nin the game of please know as well and\nif you want to learn more about those\nstrategies check out my episode on the\nfundamental game of human relationships\nit all comes down to what you want and\ni'm not here to judge or moralize and\nsay this is good and people should do\nthis and this is bad and people\nshouldn't do that i'm going to tell you\nhow it is\nand help you understand why people do\nthe things that they do\nand one final word of advice\nbe cautious with anyone who insists a\nlittle too loudly\nthat they don't play games\nthe lady often doth protest too much\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncycact's podcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
