    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nemotions are living things so this is a\nmetaphor that i like to use with my\nclients\nit's helpful to conceptualize emotions\nas living things like little creatures\nthey have their habits they have the\nthings that they like they have the\nthings that they don't like and more\nthan anything else just like any other\nliving creature\nthey want to continue to exist\nthey want to survive they want to keep\nliving\nthis is important to understand\nwhen an emotion becomes predominant\nonce you're touched by anger or\ndespondency or fear or stress your\nentire psychology gets reshuffled for\nexample when you're feeling depressed\nyou become lethargic you want to isolate\nfrom other people you want to listen to\nelliot smith songs you remember all the\ntimes you've been rejected and your\nexpectations of the future see you dying\nalone in some musty and forgotten corner\nof the world\ndo you see\nevery part of your psychology has been\ninfluenced by these by this emotion your\nbehavior your motivation your\npreferences your memory your attention\nyour imagination your reason it's all\nbeen affected\nand here's the important part\nif you were to relent to all of these\nimpulses if you were to isolate and\nruminate and listen to elliot smith then\nyour depression would continue to exist\nwhich\nas a living creature is what depression\nwants\nit wants to continue to exist so in\norder to ensure its own survival it's\ngoing to try to get you to do what it\nneeds you to do for that to happen\nrelenting to the impulses of depression\nmakes depression very happy\nbecause not only is there no threat to\nits existence it's going to thrive under\nthose circumstances\nthe fact of the matter is\nwhen we become touched by an emotion\nall the suggestions that our mind gives\nus\nserve the emotion that we're feeling\nthey allow that emotion to continue to\nexist\nand in some cases those suggestions\nserve that emotion\nmore than they serve ourselves\nso we should be mindful of that\nnow if we don't like that if we would\nprefer not to feel the way that we're\nfeeling then on some level we have to do\nthe opposite of what our minds are\nsuggesting to us in that moment\nand this can feel very strange\nand it's going to feel stranger the more\npowerful the emotion this is because the\nemotion is like hey hey what are you\ndoing stop that if you do that i'm going\nto die you know\nand so it'll turn up the volume to try\nto get you back in line because you know\nits survival is at stake\ni mean what would we do if we were\ncornered and our lives were at stake\npretty much anything we could do to\ncontinue to live\nand that's what emotions will do if you\nlet them\nso we can kind of expect that our\nemotions will intensify when we decide\nto take opposite action but opposite\naction is absolutely essential to begin\nto counteract the impulses that\nperpetuate the undesired emotion\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\ncychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
