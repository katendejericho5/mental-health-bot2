    "transcript": "people often think that the time to talk\nabout these things is generally when\nthey are most emotionally Salient I.E\nstrike when the iron is hot however I\nfound that doing so functionally\nguarantees that whatever reasonable\npoint you are about to make will be\ncompletely lost a much better idea on\nthe other hand is to strike when the\niron is cold that is to bring up issues\nin the absence of emotionality this can\nbe difficult to do because the issues\nwill feel less relevant when they are\ndisconnected from any kind of emotional\nurgency however if you're actually\ninterested in being heard and\ninfluencing change then bringing up\nissues in the absence of emotionality\nwill significantly improve your\nlikelihood of success the right word is\nwasted if it's delivered at the wrong\nmoment"
