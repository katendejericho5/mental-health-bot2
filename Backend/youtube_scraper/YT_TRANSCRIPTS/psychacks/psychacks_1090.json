    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe game of small talk\nthere are very few people i've ever met\nwho enjoy small talk\ni'm not one of them\ni like to have authentic grounded\ninteresting conversations with people\nbut the fact of the matter is that you\ngenerally don't know what topics are\ngoing to facilitate that kind of\nconversation with someone you've never\nmet before so on some level small talk\nis a necessary evil but it's an evil\nwith a point\nthe point of small talk is to get out of\nsmall talk as quickly as possible\nwhat i've discovered is that there's\nsomething of a game to small talk and\nthat you can get good at playing this\ngame i learned this in the course of my\nwork as a therapist which is a job in\nwhich i basically get paid to talk to\npeople\nthere are conversational tactics that\nyou can practice and master that make it\neasier to open a conversational partner\none strategy is to approach small talk\nlike it's a game\nand a great metaphor for just such a\ngame is the popular word game wordle\nwhere you have to guess a five letter\nword in six tribes and after each\nattempt the game gives you some feedback\nlike this is the right letter in the\nright position or this is the right\nletter in the wrong position and you use\nthis feedback\nbasically as a pathway toward guessing\nthe actual word now\nwhat does this have to do with small\ntalk\nwell when you play wordle you assume\nthat the word actually exists like there\nreally is a valid five letter word that\nyou're trying to guess but that you just\ndon't know it yet\nby the same token when you're talking to\nsomebody else\nyou can assume that there actually is an\nauthentic shared interest the two of you\nhave in common but you just don't know\nwhat it is yet\nassuming the shared interest is there\nwill help motivate you to search for it\nwhich will obviously help you to\ndiscover it\nso assume that you and your conversation\npartner have an authentic shared\ninterest and that this authentic shared\ninterest is discoverable\nin six attempts\njust like in wordle where we get six\nchances to guess the word you should\nwith practice be able to hit upon that\nauthentic shared interest in six\nexchanges\nand the best way to do that is to be a\ngenerous communicator\nwhat does that mean\nbeing a generous communicator means\ngiving your conversation partner several\nopportunities to progress the\nconversation in each exchange so for\ninstance if someone were to ask me where\nare you from\ni could answer matter-of-factly\nlas vegas\nbut that's just a factual piece of\ninformation i'm kind of forcing my\npartner to do a lot of the work this is\nalready starting to feel like an\ninterview\non the other hand if i were to be a more\ngenerous communicator i could respond\nyou know i was actually born and raised\nin las vegas a few miles from the strip\nwhich was made for a pretty interesting\nchildhood but i've spent time in seattle\nnew york i now live in the bay area\nthough who knows for how much longer how\nabout you\nin this response i've given my\nconversation partner so many pathways\nforward i mentioned four different\nplaces\nsignaled i was open to discussing my\nchildhood experiences and left an open\nquestion with respect to my future plans\nand if none of that was interesting they\ncould ignore it and just talk about\nthemselves what about you\nnow this person has several\npossibilities to move the conversation\nforward and my partner is likely going\nto pick the pathway that is closest to\nsomething that he or she actually\nresonates with which represents an\nauthentic interest\nyou may not get there on the first try\nbut like in wordle if you pay attention\nto your partner's feedback you can feel\nout whether you're moving closer to your\ngoal it's kind of like a game of hot and\ncold\nand if you model generosity in\ncommunication this often invites the\nother person to reciprocate at that\nlevel of generosity\nkeep this up and within a few back and\nforth you won't be making small talk\nanymore you'll actually be talking about\nsomething the two of you authentically\ncare about that's an interesting\nconversation and the crazy thing is with\npractice you can reliably get there in\nless than a minute\nand then maybe you won't dread small\ntalk so much\nassume there is an authentic shared\ninterest that you can discover be a\ngenerous communicator and practice\npractice practice\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
