    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nfundamental game of human relationships\nif you've been following this channel\nyou know that i'm enamored with the\nconcept of the game\ni love this concept because there's so\nmuch you can do with it\nand i define a game as anything with\nrules and a goal\nand today i'm going to talk about the\nfundamental game of human relationships\nit's called the game of please know\nmany of you might not know this but\nbefore\npsychology i was actually a theater\nactor and i worked for over a decade as\na professional actor in new york city\ni began that career at a prestigious\nacting conservatory there and for the\nentire first year of my training my\nacting class was entirely devoted to a\nsingle exercise which was called the\ngame of please no\nand over the ensuing decades i've come\nto understand that this is the\nfundamental game of human relationships\nso i'd like to briefly describe what\nthis game entails\nthe game of please know is very simple\nit's always played between two people\nand the rules are as follows one person\ncan only say the word please\nand the other person can only say the\nwords yes or no\nand this person has to start in the no\nposition\nthe please person always acts first and\nthe game goes on as long as it needs to\nthe goal of the game is for the please\nperson to change the yes no person's no\ninto a yes that's it\namong other things this goal is an\nexcellent way to develop non-verbal\ncommunication skills i mean you only\nhave one word to use\nso you pay attention to things like\ntonality proxemics posture gesture\nrhythm pacing etc however the aspect of\nthe game that i want to focus on today\nis its relation to the negotiation at\nthe heart of all human relationships\nwe go to other people because we want\nsomething from them\nthis could be love attention\nmoney\nsex\nresources kindness\nadvice friendship play doesn't matter\nwe go to other people when we want\nsomething from them and that's why the\nplease person always acts first\nthe issue is as i've discussed in a\nprevious episode the universe lives\nclosed\nwhich is to say the default starting\nposition of the universe is always\nno can i have this job no can i have\nthis house no can i have a date no want\nto hang out\nno\nand that's why the yes no person always\nstarts from a no position\nthe fundamental game of human\nrelationships is the game that we play\nto get what we want from other people\nthe game of transforming knows into\nyeses\nat the end of the day\npeople are successful in life\nin direct proportion to their ability to\ntransform no's into yeses\nor to put it another way in direct\nrelation to their mastery of the game of\nplease know\nmaster this game and the world is yours\nfor the taking\nrefuse to play and the world will be a\ncold and miserable place\nif you ever decide to play this game\nyourself you'll very quickly learn that\nsuccess is not a one-size-fits-all\nordeal\nthe same game played between the same\nindividuals on one day will have a very\ndifferent progress and potential outcome\nthan the same game played between the\nsame two individuals on another\nyou'll also come to see that the various\nmethods or strategies utilized by the\nplease people to secure their yeses are\nvaried but they're not infinite\nin fact these strategies tend to fall\ninto a few easily identifiable general\ncategories which include seduction\nintimidation\nhumor\nsupplication\nsincerity etc\nand these strategies will work\ndifferentially on different people on\ndifferent days the trick to mastering\nthe game of please know is being able to\nsuss out as quickly and reliably as\npossible the strategy that is most\nlikely to be effective for that\nparticular person in that particular\nmoment\nand you do this\nby learning to listen more carefully to\nthe no response and becoming more\nperceptive to the information contained\ntherein\nbecause the fact of the matter is that\nthe way a person says no\nalways contains a clue\nabout how to get them to say yes\nprovided you know how to listen\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
