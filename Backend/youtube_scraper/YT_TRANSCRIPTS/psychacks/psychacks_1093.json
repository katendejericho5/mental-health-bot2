    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is a\nsimple anxiety reduction technique\nlet's do some ruthless gardening today\nand discuss an easy way to experience\nless anxiety in your everyday life to do\nthis we'll need to understand some of\nthe differences between the concepts of\nwant\nand need\nneed at the end of the day is associated\nwith survival there are very few things\nthat we actually need in life we need\nsome food we need water we need some\nmeasure of safety and shelter and living\nin society we need some money to acquire\nthose things\nand beyond that there's not much that we\nneed\nso the concept of need is related to\nsurvival\nand that means that it's psychologically\nassociated with dissolution and death\non the other hand the concept of want or\ndesire\nbeing related to acquisition and growth\nis psychologically associated with\nassimilation and life\nnow\nin many respects need and want are kind\nof like two sides of the same coin\nhowever\nwhich side you choose to focus on can\nmake an enormous difference in the\nexperience of your everyday life\nfor instance\na person might harbor the belief\ni need to be rich\nif you feel into this statement you can\nsense a low-grade anxiety permeating\nthis belief\nand that's because when we use the\nconcept of need\nthere is an implied threat that if it\ndoesn't happen\nsomething very bad will occur\nyou can almost imagine this like mental\nslave driver whipping people into shape\nin order to avoid the imagined\ncatastrophic outcome\nnow contrast that with this belief\ni want to be rich\nthe truth is that you don't have to\navoid a negative like poverty in order\nto want to make money\nrich people want to make money\ni like this reframe because it doesn't\nrequire it doesn't invite in\nthe negative as a necessary motivating\nforce\nthere is no ill to be avoided just a\ngood to be acquired\nby transforming need statements into\nwant statements we learn to focus more\nand more on the positive things in life\nthat we want to secure\nas opposed to negative things we want to\navoid\nand this is important because what we\nfocus on becomes the content of our\nconsciousness the stuff out of which our\nreality is constructed moment by moment\nif we focus on ills to be avoided by\nmisapplying the concept of need then\nreality becomes a dangerous place\nfull of bad things lurking around every\ncorner\nand how would that not exacerbate a form\nof generalized anxiety\non the other hand\nif we focus on the good to be acquired\nby utilizing the concept of want\nthen reality becomes an abundant place\nfull of resources and opportunities\nso instead of looking for what you need\nto avoid\nsearch for what you want to find\nand a good way to do this is to become\nincreasingly mindful and intentional in\nour use of these important concepts\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
