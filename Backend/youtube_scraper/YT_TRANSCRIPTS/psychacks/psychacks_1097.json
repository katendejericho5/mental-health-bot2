    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe reason why you exist\none way or another we all have to come\nto grips with some of the existential\nrealities of being alive on this planet\nwhat is the point of life what am i\nsupposed to do\nwhy do i exist at all\nnow i'm not saying that i can\ndefinitively answer these questions i'm\nnot really sure anyone can\nbut here's a perspective that i've\ndeveloped to provide a reasonably\nsatisfying response\npeople tend to get stuck on existential\nquestions when they introduce\nunnecessary complexity\ni'd like you to consider\nthat the point of life is to\nexperience life\nwhat if it's that simple\nwe come here to this planet so that we\ncan fall in love and swim in the ocean\nand feel the sunlight and experience\nfriendship and understand betrayal and\nknow the thrill of adventure and the\nglory of triumph and the joys of\ncontentment and the pains of grief and\nthe brilliant intensity of midday and\nthe gentle warmth of dusk and to feel\nvery very big and very very small at the\nsame time\nin short\nwe come\nincarnate in life\nin order to experience life\nthat's why you exist\na metaphor i often use with clients is\nthat life is like disneyland\nthe point of disneyland is to go on the\nrides you go to disneyland to experience\ndisneyland you don't get anything else\nfrom going\nyou can't win or lose disneyland you\ncan't do disneyland right or wrong\nyou can't do it perfectly and you can't\nscrew it up\nif you want to go on the tea cups 50\ntimes in a row because by god that's\nyour favorite ride you didn't do\ndisneyland badly by the same token if\nyou want to ride every single ride in\nthat park you don't get a gold star\nyou didn't do disneyland well\nin both cases you did what you wanted\nand you had your experience\nso life is like being in the park\nwhich offers us this multiplicity of\nexperiences\nwe can ride the thrilling rides or the\ngentle rides we can even spend our whole\ntime watching other people ride the\nrides\neach experience is different\nbut on some level they're all equally\nexistentially full\nthey all constitute\none day at disneyland\nthat's it\nand at the end of the day\nwe all go home\nthere's no way to do it right there's no\nway to do it wrong\nthere's no way to win there's no way to\nlose\nlife is just a theme park of experiences\nand when evening comes hopefully we'll\nbe able to leave with some good memories\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychxpodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
