    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nconquering the fear\nof being judged by others\nthis is a problem that i encounter\nroutinely in my clinical practice and i\nhave some measure of success in helping\npeople overcome it\nthe key to doing so requires us to\nunderstand a psychological concept\ncalled theory of mind\nit's a little clunky\nbut theory of mind basically means that\nwe tend to believe that other people\nthink the same way that we do\nin order to make interpersonal\ncommunication efficient let alone\npossible\nwe project our consciousness onto others\nand interact with them through that\nprojection this process is unconscious\nand functionally inescapable\ntheory of mind is a kind of necessary\nevil because it's just not possible to\ndirectly experience the consciousness of\nothers and it's generally safer to\nassume that for all our differences we\nhave more in common than we don't\nlike for example we assume a common\npreference to avoid pain and disrespect\non the grounds that we ourselves would\nprefer to avoid those things and this\nprojected assumption keeps society more\nor less civil\nso you can see how theory of mind can\nfacilitate pro-social affiliation\ntheory of mind can also be an effective\nmeans by which to change our actual\nexperience of reality let's get a bit\nmore concrete as i mentioned before i\noften talk with folks who are afraid of\nbeing judged by others\nthey generally don't have any concrete\nproof of these negative judgments\nhowever they believe that these\njudgments are a kind of social\ninevitability\nthey believe that other people secretly\nthink that they are annoying or stupid\nor unattractive etc\nthen i talk to these people a bit more\nand i generally come to learn that these\nvery same people who believe that other\npeople are judging them negatively\nare almost constantly in the process of\njudging other people\nnegatively these folks are often very\nvery judgmental of other people\nand by virtue of theory of mind they\nassume that other folks are behaving in\nthe privacy of their own consciousness\nthe way that they themselves\nare behaving in the privacy of their own\nconsciousness\nand they are unconsciously projecting\nthis tendency onto other people\nbasically if i'm negatively judging\nother people on a consistent basis then\ni'm going to assume that other people\nare doing the same thing as a matter of\ncourse\nso\nwhat does this have to do with changing\nour experience of reality well according\nto theory of mind we can change our\nexperience of reality by altering the\ncontent of our own consciousness\nfor instance i typically ask those with\na fear of being judged to become\nincreasingly mindful of their own\nnegative judgments of others and to\naddress these with the block and replace\ntechnique\nand when the frequency and intensity of\ntheir negative judgments of others\nbegins to decline\nlo and behold all of a sudden\nthe world doesn't seem to be as\njudgmental as it used to be\nit's fascinating\nand this i think is how we can\npotentially understand\nthe buddhist admonition to change the\nworld by changing yourself it's through\ntheory of mind\nif we change the content and structure\nof our own consciousness then by virtue\nof this unconscious projection we come\nto live in a world that's increasingly\naligned with these changes inevitably\nand by default on some level it can't\nnot occur\nso that's what i'd like you to consider\nto what extent can you intentionally\nchange your beliefs about reality to\ncreate an experience of reality that's\nmore aligned with your own\nself-interests\nwhat do you think\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
