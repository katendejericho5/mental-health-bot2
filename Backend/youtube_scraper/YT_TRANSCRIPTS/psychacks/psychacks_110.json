    "transcript": "first question for you uh you said that\nwomen mate and date for gain and Men try\nto mate and date for acceptable loss and\nI was very curious about that well sure\nI mean the mate and date for gain part\nis just basic hypertony which is more\nthe sense of I think women need to feel\nlike they're going to benefit from a\nrelationship to feel like it's worth the\nopportunity cost of pursuing that\nopportunity versus all the other\nopportunities they may have available to\nthem it sort of makes sense I think guys\nwould also mate and date for Gam kind of\nif they could but because a lot of that\ntakes place in the 20s where women's\nsexual Marketplace value is higher than\nmen's I think that they are in a\nprivileged position to better dictate\nterms for a relationship so it's simple\neconomics if women are mating and dating\nfor gain then if they're Ming a dating\nwith men anyway men have to sort of\nresign themselves to accept loss and I\nthink that there is acceptable loss and\nunacceptable loss and I think it's for\nevery man to determine for himself where\nthat line is"
