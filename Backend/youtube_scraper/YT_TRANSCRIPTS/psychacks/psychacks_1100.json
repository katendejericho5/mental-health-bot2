    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nhow to suffer less in life\ni mean\nwho wouldn't want to know how to suffer\nless in life that's pretty much the top\nof my list of hobbies and interests\nnow what i've discovered over the years\nis that the root of a great deal of my\nunnecessary suffering lies in my\ndecision to say no\nto whatever is happening in the present\nmoment\nfor whatever reason i've made the\ndecision that what is happening is\nsomething that i don't want\nand therefore i put myself in the\nposition of resisting reality\nthis saying no this turning away this\nresistance\ncreates friction\nand this friction is a source of a good\namount of unnecessary suffering on this\nplanet\nhere's the thing\nour resistance to the present moment\ndoes not improve the present moment\nif anything it provokes resistance and\ndefensiveness in those around us\nwhich often leads to the exacerbation or\nthe worsening\nof the unpreferred situation\nit also instills the spirit of suffering\ninside of me\nwhich prevents me from responding\noptimally to whatever's going around\ngoing on around me\nso regardless of whether we should or\nshouldn't resist a given outcome we can\ncertainly make the argument that it is\nless effective to do so\nit generally doesn't help us get what we\nwant\non the other hand i've learned that if i\ncan find a way to turn toward the\npresent moment to say yes to it to\naccept that it is what it is\nthen at the very least\ni succeed in\nnot making my situation any harder than\nit already is\nand if i'm lucky this turning towards\ncan even improve my situation\nhow\nby adopting a posture of willingness\nto work with what is\nas opposed to a posture of willfulness\nthat insists that reality conformed to\nmy preference\ni give myself the best possible chance\nof recognizing the potential that may be\ninherent in the situation\nvery few things in life are so\ncompletely categorically negative that\nthey can't be used to some advantage\nand by adopting a posture of willingness\nwe can continue to work towards our\ngoals regardless of the prevailing\nconditions\nnow surrendering to the necessity of the\npresent moment is easier said than done\nit's simple but it's not easy\none thing that helps is to remember that\nyou're doing this out of enlightened\nself-interest\nyou practice willingness\nnot because you condone or approve of\nwhat's happening\nbut because you want to suffer less\nand by suffering less you allow yourself\nto be in that moment with let's say more\nof your faculties intact so that you can\nrespond more effectively to whatever\nhappens to be in that present moment\nby turning towards and saying yes you\ncan even\nsometimes but not always\nimprove the situation\nwhat do you think have you found this to\nbe effective in your own experience\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation a consultation you can\nreach me at cycact's podcast at\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
