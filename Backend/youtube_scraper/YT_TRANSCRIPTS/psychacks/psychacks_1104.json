    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\nthe experience of inner emptiness\nso this is something that i've\nexperienced in my own life\nand i believe it is at the heart of many\nof the issues that i discuss with my\nclients namely this inner emptiness this\nvoid that exists or seems to exist\ninside of us\ni experience it as a kind of painful\nnumbness if that makes sense and it's\nhighly aversive\nthose who experience it try all kinds of\nways to fill it\nthey try to fill it with drugs and\nalcohol with sex and relationships with\nwork and business\nwith money and power\nwith distraction and pleasure etc i mean\nthere's just so many ways that human\nbeings have invented in their attempts\nto avoid this\nexperience and they don't work\nwhich is to say that they work for a\ntime at a great cost\nand the reason for this is that you\ncan't solve an internal problem with an\nexternal solution\nand the sense of emptiness is definitely\nan internal problem\n[Music]\nthat said\ni no longer experience this inner\nemptiness myself and i've helped other\npeople to heal from this experience as\nwell to\nfill\nthis inner emptiness\nand in my experience there are really\nonly three ways to do this\nthe first is psychotherapy\nokay that's straightforward enough the\nsecond\nis a felt relationship with a higher\npower okay let's talk about this one\non some level the experience of inner\nemptiness is a spiritual issue\nand that's why it can't be solved with\nmaterial things like money sex and\nsubstances it's a spiritual issue\nand to address a spiritual issue you\nneed a felt emotional relationship not\nan intellectualized relationship a felt\nemotional relationship with a higher\npower however you choose to define that\nit's within this relationship that you\ncan feel loved unconditionally and\nexistentially justified\nit's within this relationship that i\nbegan to experience myself more and more\nas a being who deserves to exist on this\nplanet\nand increasing my capacity to receive\ndivine love and grace did a lot to fill\nthat emptiness that we're discussing\nokay so therapy higher power\nthe third way\nis to create yourself\nthrough the intentional striving toward\nan ultimate goal\nmost people are plankton\nthey're drifting through life\nand their daily lives are shaped more by\nthe currents that buffett them than by\ntheir own purpose and will this is no\nbueno\nit's important to sit down and develop a\nvision for your life like seriously\nwhere do you want to be in 10 years so\nthat you can reverse engineer backward\nto your starting point in order to\ncreate a trajectory toward your ultimate\ngoal\nand this striving is going to be\nchallenging\nit's going to be time consuming and it's\ngoing to demand a sacrifice of blood\nsweat and tears\nbut in that sacrifice you might gain\nsomething greater\nthan what you spent\nand what you might gain among other\nthings is the creation of yourself\non some level we become what we strive\ntoward\nand this meaning making requires\nsacrifice at the very least\nthe sacrifice of who you are\nfor who you hope to become\nwhat do you think have you experienced\nsomething similar\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
