    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is\npsychatz better living through\npsychology and the subject of today's\nshort talk is how to do something you've\nnever done before\nso every day is a challenge that brings\nwith it new and unexpected difficulties\nto overcome and sometimes it can be\nintimidating when you're confronted with\na problem that you've never worked\nthrough in the past so i'm here to offer\nyou two tips for overcoming new problems\nin your life whatever they may be\nthe first is to look around and ask\nyourself\nare there any other people who have\nsuccessfully dealt with this problem\nfor example i've worked with a lot of\nnew parents in my practice and some of\nthem understandably experience anxiety\nover their new roles after all taking\ncare of a child might not be something\nthey've ever done before\nso i asked these folks hey look around\ndo you see any other people who have\nsuccessfully overcome this problem\nyes there are literally billions of\npeople on this planet who have become\nparents more or less successfully to\ntheir children\nand then i think\nif these people can do it\nif these people can do it then so can i\ni'm no better and no worse than any of\nthese people who have managed to\novercome the same problem so if they can\ndo it i can definitely do it\nthe second tip is to refocus attention\non your own ability your own capacity\nfor example i'll look back over the\ncourse of my life and remember hey\nthere's been hundreds if not thousands\nof times in the past that i've\nencountered a novel problem\nwithout precedent in my life and\nhere i am today\nso i must have been able to overcome it\none way or another\nthis means that the experience of\novercoming an unprecedented problem of\ndoing something i've never done before\nactually has a great deal of precedent\ni've gone through that hundreds or\nthousands of times in my life the\ndetails are different but the underlying\nexperience is the same\nso i can feel confident in my ability to\nrespond appropriately to a novel problem\nbecause i've done so consistently in the\npast\nin the words of the carthaginian general\nhannibal i will either find a way or\nmake a way\nand this novel problem is in actuality\nnothing new\nwhat do you think\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychex podcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
