    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is values\nand decision making\nas i've mentioned in previous episodes\nvalues can actually be pretty expensive\nso why bother having them i mean it's a\nfair question because if we're going to\npay the cost associated with having\nsomething we need to be sure that we're\ngetting our money's worth\nmy argument is that values are generally\nworth their cost because they're\nactually really useful in helping us\nmake decisions\nevery day of our lives we stand at\ncrossroads these are moments in time\nthat require us to ask ourselves what\nshould i do\nthese can be difficult questions and\nwe're forced to respond to them\nconstantly that's the human experience\nwe're a species of deciders and we can't\nnot respond as choosing to not respond\nis itself a response on some level we're\nall called to respond to life even if\nit's against our will\nso how do we do this effectively how can\nwe choose which path to take at the\ncrossroads of life\nwell one way to do this is to use values\nvalues are like\nlenses\nthey're like lenses through which we can\nview\nappropriate paths forward at any given\ncrossroads\nand without these lenses it can look\nlike there's just an overwhelming number\nlike even an infinite number of possible\npaths forward\nand it can be very difficult to make a\ndecision in the face of that kind of\noptionality so what these lenses do is\nthey filter out the vast majority of\npathways at any given crossroads as\nbeing incongruent with the specific\nfocus of that lens so for example you\ncould be faced with a certain\npredicament that prompts you to ask\nyourself what should i do how should i\nrespond\nwell you can break out your values and\nlook through their lenses at the array\nof possibilities for instance you could\nask what is the courageous response\nand if you look through the lens of\ncourage\n90 percent of the possible paths forward\nwill just immediately vanish\nbecause they're incongruent with courage\nthey're just invisible now\nin fact there's likely going to be only\na couple of options that would actually\nfacilitate a courageous response\nor you could ask what is the wise\nresponse and you can bring the lens of\nwisdom to your eye and\na different set of potential pathways\nforward are now visible to you as you\nlook through that filter\nwhat's the kind thing to do what's the\njust thing to do what's the\nself-respecting thing to do etc and\nwe'll see that the courageous response\nisn't always the kind response which\nisn't always the just response and so on\nso it's important to be intentional and\nconscientious about which values you're\nusing to make your decisions to move\nforward because whatever pathway you're\nwalking down\nyou'll move further and further in that\ndirection\nso if you're moving down the pathway of\ncourage you may be getting closer to\nembodying that value but also further\nfrom embodying other values kind of no\nway around that\nso identify what your values are or at\nleast what you'd like them to be and use\nthem consistently to make intentional\ndecisions at the crossroads of your life\nand that's how you get your money's\nworth\nwhat do you think\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
