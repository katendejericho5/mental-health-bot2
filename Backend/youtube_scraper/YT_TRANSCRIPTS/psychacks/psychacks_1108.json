    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe position\nof the adorer\nso this is a continuation of my previous\nepisode on the balance of attraction\nremember no two people can like each\nother exactly the same amount\nso in any relationship one person likes\nthe other more and one person likes the\nother less\nin this episode i'll be talking about\nthe person who likes the other more i.e\nthe person who occupies the position of\nthe adorer\nnow there are pros and cons to this\nposition basically if you're more\nromantically inclined\nor you prefer to live in your emotions\nthen this is the position for you\nthink about the lovey-dovey stereotype\nof infatuated couples where each one is\narguing with the other i love you more\nno no i love you more no no silly pants\ni love you more\netc\nneither partner wants to be the adored\nbecause occupying that position would\nprevent them from being the adorer now\nthis stereotype is comic hyperbole but\nsome vestiges of it remain in even more\nmature relationships\nmake no mistake such individuals want to\nbe the adorer and why might that be\nbecause adorers get to be with the one\nthey love\nand they get to experience all of the\nemotional consequences associated with\nthat opportunity\nthey look forward to seeing the adored\nwith positive anticipation\nthey feel elated when things are going\nwell and devastated when things are\ngoing poorly\nthey may feel worried or insecure or\nconfident and reassured adorers whether\nthey're conscious in it or not\nenter into relationships to feel\nboth the dizzying highs and the\nterrifying lows to be sure they may\ncomplain about the lows however for many\npeople relationships that stimulate\nnegative emotions are preferable to\nrelations that elicit no emotion at all\nthis isn't an unpleasant truth but a\ntruth nonetheless\nand the frequency and intensity of the\nemotional experience is always greater\nwhen they occupy the position of the\nadorer\nand the intensity of that experience is\ndirectly related to the size of the gap\nin the balance of attraction\nbigger gaps like between a movie star\nand a devoted fan\nbigger emotions for the adorer\nsmaller gaps like between two peers\nsmaller emotions for the adorer but\nalways\nmore emotions for the adorer than the\nadored and this can be either a pro or a\ncon like i mentioned previously the two\npositions are actually value neutral it\nreally depends on your preference for\nemotional experience the feeling of\nloving the feeling of being in love\nindeed those who prefer to live in their\nemotions can become bored or\nuncomfortable if they're placed in the\nposition of the adored for an extended\nperiod of time or to a significant\ndegree\nthey may even create unnecessary\nconflict in an attempt to redistribute\nthe balance of attraction to preferred\nlevels\nwhat do you think drop a comment below\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
