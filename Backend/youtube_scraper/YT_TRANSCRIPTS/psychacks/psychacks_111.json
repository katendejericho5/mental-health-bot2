    "video_title": "The type of emotion doesn't matter, its intensity does",
    "transcript": "one thing I've learned as a therapist is\nthat once people pass a certain\nthreshold of emotion their capacity to\nthink rationally is completely\ncompromised the type of emotion doesn't\nmatter we started talking about\narguments so it's often anger but it can\nalso be hopelessness and despondency or\nfear and Terror or jealousy and\ninsecurity only the intensity of the\nemotion is relevant not its tamber and\nonce this line is crossed words are\ngenerally powerless this means that the\nmost useful truth or the most most\ntrenchant Insight or the most persuasive\npiece of evidence is going to fall on\ndeaf ears they will just not be able to\nhear it or even worse they'll hear it\nthrough the lens of their emotion which\nwill generally cause the comment to be\nperceived as an attack on the continued\nexistence of the emotion in question and\nthis will lead to defensiveness\nminimization and invalidation remember\nemotions are living things and like\nliving things they will fight to\npreserve their lives in a myriad of ways"
