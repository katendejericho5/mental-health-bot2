    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow is it good\nif you take a look at your life and you\nsee certain habits or behaviors that on\nthe surface\nseem to cause a lot of harm or stress or\ndifficulty for you\nbut that you still have trouble getting\nrid of\nask yourself this question\nhow is it good\nthat is what function does this behavior\nserve what is this behavior doing in the\ncontext of your life how does it help\nyou\nit has to serve a function or else it\nstill wouldn't be there\neven if it's dysfunctional remember most\nthe word dysfunction\nis the word function\nmost dysfunctional behavior is actually\nfunctional it serves a purpose\nit just tends to only function for a\nwhile at a great cost\nin the vast majority of cases\ndespite the obvious pain and suffering\ninvolved dysfunctional behavior is\nconsidered a net positive\nin the mind of the individual in\nquestion\nfor example i often work with people who\nare chronic worriers they worry about\nthings all the time hundreds of times a\nday they understand rationally that most\nof things they're concerned about will\nnever happen and that their constant\nworrying is driving them crazy\nand yet they often feel kind of\nambivalent about letting go of the habit\ndespite asking for help\nand this generally has to do with the\nfunction that this behavior is serving\nin that person's life namely they\nbelieve that on a deeper level\nthe worrying behavior keeps them safe\nwhich is a good thing\nthey believe that if they weren't\nworrying about the future they would be\neven more exposed and vulnerable than\nthey already feel\nso even though they understand the\nworrying corrodes their quality of life\nthey believe on the whole\nthat worrying is a net positive for them\nsince the perceived protective factors\nassociated with worrying\noutweigh the pain and distress it more\nobviously causes\nyou can generalize this to basically any\nquote\ndysfunctional behavior in your life\nit's still around because on some level\nyou believe it to be a net positive\nthat as problematic as this behavior has\nbecome\nmaintaining it is still preferable to\ngiving it up\nwhich might expose you to even more pain\nand distress\nthis means that you can't really just\nstop a dysfunctional behavior you\nactually have to replace it with another\nbehavior that achieves the same ends\nwhile creating fewer problems\nthis would mean that to address the\nissue of say chronic worrying you would\nneed to find other ways to reduce the\nfelt experience of vulnerability or to\nincrease the feeling of safety\nboth of which are important needs\nso if you're having trouble trying to\nunderstand why some habit persists in\nyour life despite it causing you pain\nand distress ask yourself how is it good\nwhat is it doing in your life\nhow are you considering it a net\npositive within your own subjective\nunderstanding you might be surprised by\nthe answers you come up with\nwhat do you think does this square with\nyour own understanding\nremember to like and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
