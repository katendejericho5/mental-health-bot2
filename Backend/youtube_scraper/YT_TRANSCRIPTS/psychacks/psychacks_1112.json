    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is it will\nnever be easier\nthan it is today\nso basically as a psychologist i'm a\nperson who facilitates change in others\npeople come to me because they want to\ndo certain things or they want to stop\ndoing certain other things\nunfortunately by the time they come to\nme those behavior patterns are already\nfairly entrenched from years of\nrepetition the image i like to use is\nthat of walking the same path through a\nfield for 20 years\neventually you will wear down the grass\nand there will be a clear trail through\nthat meadow\nit's often the case that when clients\nfirst really consider the possibility of\nchanging\nit can feel demoralizing\nthey think about the sheer amount of\ntime they will need to carve a new path\nthrough the field and there's certainly\nsome truth to that i mean if you've cut\na trail through the wilderness it will\ntake some time to a develop a new path\nforward and b\nallowed the old path to return to nature\nthat said if it's going to take a while\nyou might as well get started\nthe fact of the matter is\nthat it will never be easier than it is\ntoday\nand why is that\nbecause every day\nthat you continue to walk the same path\nboth\na\nmakes that pathway a little bit more\npermanent and established\nand b delays the creation of a new way\nthrough the field\nthe project gets longer and harder with\neach passing day\nso you might as well get started\nit will never be easier than it is today\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nremember to subscribe and hit that like\nbutton for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
