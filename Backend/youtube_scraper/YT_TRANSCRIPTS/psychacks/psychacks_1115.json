    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to get less angry\nnow the key to getting less angry is\nunderstanding the intimate relationship\nbetween should\nand anger\ngenerally behind most angry emotions is\na thought that contains the concept of\nshould\nsomething like\ni shouldn't have to deal with this or\nthis person should know better\nand these thoughts can be very dangerous\nit's not really possible to think these\nthoughts\nand believe them to be true\nand not feel angry so i'd like you to\nconsider that thoughts like these are\nreally anger pathogens\nthe issue\nis that when people use the concept of\nshould in this way\nthey're really using it incorrectly\nand that incorrect usage is what\ncontributes to emotional suffering\nthe incorrect use of the word should is\nanything that suggests that reality has\na moral or ethical obligation to be\nanything other than how it actually is\nthat reality has a moral or ethical\nobligation to be aligned with they\nbelieve reality should be\nthinking in this manner is just asking\nto be outraged\nthere's also really no basis for these\nbeliefs like where is it written that\nreality must align with our own hopes\nand desires however virtuous and noble\nthose hopes and desires might be\nthat's not really how things work on\nthis planet\nalternatively\na better use of the word should\nis as a kind of shorthand for\ngiven the confluence of factors that are\nexerting themselves on a given situation\nthe most likely outcome is that was a\nbit of a mouthful so i'll say it again\na better use of the word should is as a\nkind of shorthand for\ngiven the confluence of factors exerting\nthemselves on this situation the most\nlikely outcome is\nfor example if i were to go to the roof\nof my house and i were to drop a glass\nbottle from that height\nit should break when it hits the ground\nthat is due to the force generated by\nthe rapid deceleration when the bottle\ncomes into contact with the ground and\nthe structural integrity of the bonds\nbetween the molecules comprising the\nglass and several other factors etc etc\nthe most likely outcome\nis that the bottle breaks as a result of\nthat collision\nif it breaks it should have broken\nif for some reason it doesn't break it\nshouldn't have broken because apparently\nthe forces exerted on that bottle were\nnot sufficient to cause that to happen\neverything is as it should\nbe\nso\nyou'll notice instead of starting with\nour ideals and trying to impose them on\nreality\nand getting angry when there's a lack of\nalignment between how things are and how\nwe want them to be\nwe start with reality\nand allow reality to dictate our models\nof and beliefs about the way things\nshould be\nthis attitude is actually very\nscientific\nrather than attempting to force reality\ninto a pre-existing framework we can\nfunctionally go to reality and say teach\nme\nhelp me understand the reason why this\nhappened\nthe way that it did through an\nexamination of the forces that conspired\nto create this outcome\nas surprising or personally distasteful\nthis outcome happens to be for me teach\nme\nand if i were to continue to stubbornly\ninsist that this shouldn't have happened\nwhere people should behave in a certain\nway\nthen i'm willfully turning a blind eye\nto the reasons why reality is the way\nthat it is\nwhich actually robs me of the\nopportunity to grow into greater\nalignment with these forces for my own\nbetterment\nthe more i listen to reality the more i\ncan build accurate representations of\nreality with my words and beliefs which\nin turn will help me stay safe\nand get what i want moving forward\nwhat do you think\nwhat are the thoughts that come into\nyour head right before you lose your\ncool remember to like and subscribe for\nthe algorithm and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cycaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
