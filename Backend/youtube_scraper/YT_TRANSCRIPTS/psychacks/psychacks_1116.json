    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nhow to believe in yourself when you have\nno good reason to\nso in my episode bet on yourself i spoke\non the importance of being your biggest\nsupporter\nif you don't believe that you could do\nit why would anybody else\nunshakable self-confidence is a game\nchanger both in personal and\nprofessional relationships\nseems pretty self-explanatory\nthat said i occasionally get pushback\nfrom some of my clients on this subject\nand the most common objection i hear\nis some variant of all right orion\nself-confidence is all well and good but\nwhat if you feel like you're kind of a\nworthless waste of space\nand that you never do anything right\nand that you don't yet have any\nsuccesses to speak of\nhow can you be authentically confident\nif that's what you're working with\ni mean fair enough right\nand the way i generally respond to this\nobjection is to ask these people to\nconsider that they're the coach of a\nhigh school football team that's down at\nhalftime\nwhat would a coach in this situation do\nthrow his players under the bus\ncomplain about how incompetent and inept\nhis team is and decide it would just be\nbetter to forfeit the rest of the game\nand go home\nthat is not what a coach would do\na coach in this situation needs to do\nthree things\nfirst he needs to acknowledge the\nscoreboard yep\nthey got us in that half not gonna lie\nit's been tough out there and we're down\nby a lot\nsecond he needs to make a new plan okay\nso this is what we're gonna do different\nwhere we zigged in the first half we're\ngonna zag in the second and maybe\nthat'll help turn some things around\nand third he needs to set his players up\nfor a comeback\nwe're not out of this yet there's still\ntime on the clock when we come back from\nbehind they're going to be talking about\nthis game for years so who's with me\nso that's how you root for yourself when\nyou feel like you have no good reason to\nyou acknowledge the scoreboard you make\na new plan and you set yourself up for a\ncomeback a coach doesn't give up on his\nplayers and you can never\ngive up on yourself\nwhat do you think remember to subscribe\nand hit that like button for the\nalgorithm and if you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\ncychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
