    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe truth about romance obstruction\nso this is the third part in my series\nof episodes on this subject remember as\ni discussed in my episode the origin of\nromance romantic love is really the\ntransliterated dogma of a religious cult\nthat exists in the south of france in\nthe 11th and 12th centuries that was\nsecularized to avoid persecution by the\ncatholic church\nthis is why we see in the experience of\nromantic love so many vestiges of\nreligiosity\nin this episode i'm going to talk about\nanother truth of romance which is the\nfact that romance thrives on obstruction\nand if no obstruction exists in a\nromantic relationship\none or both of the partners will create\none consciously or not in order to\nstimulate the romantic imagination think\nabout romeo and juliet\ndo you think it was just oh\na strange coincidence that the capulets\nand montagues hated each other\nand that it was just bad luck that romeo\nwould have been killed if he were found\nin the capulet's garden\ncan you imagine what the story of romeo\nand juliet would have been like if lady\ncapulet had come to juliet and said hey\nyou know what about that nice romeo boy\nwho lives next door what a gentleman we\njust adore his parents and we think it\nwould be adorable if you two got\ntogether\nthere actually is just such a character\nin that story paris that the capulets\napprove of as a match for their daughter\nand juliet is like oh god mom that guy\nno thank you\nso it's not an accident\nthat romeo and juliet came from warring\nfamilies because whether the lovers were\nconscious of this or not that danger\nthat prohibition that obstruction\nfueled their desire for each other their\nstory could not exist without it\nwe also see this in play in the\nprototypical romantic myth the tragedy\nof tristan any soldier that i would\nhighly recommend that you look into\nobstruction is the fuel of romantic fire\nand this is why there's often a lot of\npassion and romance in long distance\nrelationships\nand extramarital affairs\nthere's something about the fact that a\nwe shouldn't be doing this\nand b\nthere's something preventing us from\ntruly being together\nthat fans the flames of desire\nmost likely this is due to the\nunconscious desire to reduce dissonance\nit's dissonant to do something that we\nshouldn't be doing\nso our unconscious mind reduces that\nuncomfortable dissonance by making us\nbelieve that the fact that we're doing\nwhat we shouldn't\nmust mean that we really want what we're\ndoing\nthis is important to keep in mind\nbecause sometimes our feelings are\nactually more of a response to some of\nthese obstructions and prohibitions than\na reflection of our actual authentic\ndesire for the other person something to\nconsider\nwhat do you think does this square with\nyour experience\nremember to subscribe and hit the like\nbutton for the algorithm and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
