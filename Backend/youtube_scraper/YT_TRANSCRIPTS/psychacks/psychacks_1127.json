    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is the\nempty canoe\nthis is a metaphor that i'm borrowing\nfrom zen master charlotte joko beck who\ni believe wrote about this in her book\neveryday zen\nwhich is just full of straightforward\nbrass tax wisdom i must have read that\nbook over 20 years ago and the metaphor\nhas stayed with me through the present\nday\nthe story goes something like this\nimagine that you were in a canoe\npaddling along on a serene lake on a\nparticularly foggy day you can barely\nsee five feet in front of you\nsuddenly another canoe emerges out of\nthe fog on a collision course with yours\nyou don't have time to respond and the\nsecond canoe knocks into yours almost\nspilling you into the lake\nonce you recover from the initial shock\nyou react with anger shouting at the\nother paddler hey watch where you're\ngoing what are you doing are you trying\nto kill us both what's wrong with you\nhowever\nonce the canoe drifts a little closer\nthrough the fog\nyou realize to your surprise\nthat there's no one in it\nit's an empty canoe\ndrifting mysteriously through the fog\nand just like that\nyour anger vanishes\nthere's no point in remaining angry at\nan inanimate object\nit's wasted energy and it generally\nshuts off fairly quickly at that point\nregardless of your intentions which is\nto say that it's actually kind of hard\nto stay angry and it didn't matter at an\ninanimate object even if you wanted to\nand that's because the imputation of\nagency is actually a core component of\nthe experience of anger in human beings\nremove the imputation of agency\nand the anger disappears\ni like to remember this metaphor\nof the empty canoe when dealing with\nfrustrating people in my everyday life\nin these moments it's sometimes helpful\nfor me to think of these people as\ninanimate objects drifting through the\nfog\nthey don't really mean it they're just\nparticles coraming through an\nindifferent universe\nthey might speak and move and act that's\nobjective reality but any agency that i\nexperience in them\nis actually my own projected psychology\nit may or may not be true\nand it may or may not be serving me in\nthat moment so i don't need to remain\nattached to that interpretation of\nreality\nand when i drop the imputation of agency\nthe anger vanishes almost instantly a\nprofound lesson from zen\nif the world is empty\nwhy fill it with the ingredients of our\nown frustration\nwhat do you think\nfeel free to drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at cychaxpodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
