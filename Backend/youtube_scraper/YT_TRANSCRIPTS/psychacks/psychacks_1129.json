    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthoughts\naren't private\nit took me\na long time to figure this out\nwhen i was younger i used to believe\nthat my mind was something like a sealed\noff laboratory where i could think\nwhatever i wanted in the privacy of my\nown consciousness without consequence\nas long as i didn't speak or act on my\nthoughts i believed my thinking to be\nhidden from the rest of the world\ni no longer believe this to be true\nand there are two main reasons why\nthe first is a corollary to my episode\non feelings are impersonal\nyou are free to think whatever you want\nbut you are not free to feel however you\nwant as a consequence of what you choose\nto think\nso for example if you think a lot of\nself-loathing self-deprecating thoughts\nyou're not really free to feel confident\nand self-assured or on the other hand if\nyou think a lot on the oppressive\ninjustice of the world you're not really\nfree to feel peaceful and content\nhow you think in large part dictates how\nyou feel and those feelings are\ngenerally observable so our thoughts are\ndisclosed through our emotions makes\nsense\nnow there's a second reason why i\nbelieve that thoughts aren't private and\nthat has to do with the fact that i'm\njust not a good enough actor\nif i harbor negative judgments about\nother people it's really only a matter\nof time before my unconscious\ncommunication betrays the presence of\nthose judgments the betrayal could be in\na glance it could be in a word choice it\ncould be in a gesture it could be in a\ntone of voice\nbut over a long enough timeline we can\nexpect that it will be something\npersonally i'm just not a good enough\nactor to control all aspects of my\nbehavior all of the time in order to\nprevent the disclosure of that attitude\nto someone who is even remotely\nsensitive to nonverbal communication\nthis is really really important\nespecially with respect to people who\nyou have to interact with on a regular\nbasis\nif you start to think ah this guy is a\nclown or i i gotta talk with this joker\nthen the more likely it will be\nthat those attitudes will subsequently\nbe betrayed by your unconscious\nnonverbal communication better to\nchallenge them in c2\nusing the block and replace technique\nsomething to keep in mind what do you\nthink drop a comment below and if you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psych hacks podcast at\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
