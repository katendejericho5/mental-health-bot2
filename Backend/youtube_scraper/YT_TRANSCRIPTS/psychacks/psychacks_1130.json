    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nto hope\nis to wait\nthis is a realization that i came to the\nother day while i was watching a\nportuguese language film\nin which the characters repeatedly use\nthe verb esperara\nnow many of you probably already know\nthat in several romance languages the\nverb esperar means both to hope and to\nwait which to my english language\nimagination always seemed like two very\ndifferent actions\nbut the more i considered it the more i\nrealized that there is an inextricable\ncomponent of waiting to hoping\nfor example\nlet's say you want to go to the movies\nbut when you stroll the theater there is\na line to speak to the cashier in the\nbox office\nmost likely you will decide to wait in\nthat line as you have a reasonable\nexpectation a reasonable hope\nthat if you exercise sufficient patience\nyou will eventually arrive at the front\nof the line\nand you can purchase a ticket to the\nmovie you hope to see\nit would be unreasonable to hope that\nthis would occur if you decided not to\nwait in the line\nor if you instead chose to wait in the\nline in front of a nightclub saying\nhope is not justified without waiting\nnor is it justified when waiting\ninappropriately\nsome people are just waiting\nthey're waiting in the wrong place\nwhich means that they're waiting without\nhope irrespective of whatever they\nhappen to be telling themselves this is\nfoolish\nthere must be an element of justified\nhope to our waiting otherwise we're just\nwasting our time\nso if you're waiting for something you\nhope to achieve\nbe sure that you're waiting in the right\nline\nhopefully that makes sense\nif you're watching on youtube please\ndrop a comment below and if you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
