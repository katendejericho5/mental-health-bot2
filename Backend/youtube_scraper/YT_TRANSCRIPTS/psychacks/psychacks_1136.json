    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe price of peace\nnow there was a time that i was living\nin san francisco\nand parking my car in the street\nand despite my best efforts about once a\nmonth on average i would get a parking\nticket\ni really dislike getting parking tickets\ni don't know where those parking\nenforcers in san francisco are hiding\nbut they're like ninjas you look away\nfor a minute there's a notice on your\ncar it's incredible\nanyway when this would happen\ni would invariably get upset and lose my\ncool\nbesides eventually developing a system\nwhereby i completely eliminated the\npossibility of getting another parking\nticket which i could probably talk about\nin another episode\ni sat down and i examined the\nrationality of my anger\nand when i thought about it i understood\nthat what my anger was communicating was\nthat my peace my emotional equilibrium\nwas worth less to me than an 80 fine\nby getting upset about a parking ticket\ni was communicating that i was willing\nto throw my piece away that cheaply\nnow i'm not a saint by any means and i\nstill lose my cool from time to time\nbut now i try to make sure that it's\nworth it to lose my cool you know what\ni'm saying\ni've come to value my peace more\nso the price of my piece has risen\nto the point that something has to be\nfairly expensive before i flip my lid\ni don't sell my piece cheaply\nhere's the same idea from a different\nangle\nwhat if someone offered you 500\nbut in return you had to feel angry for\nseveral days\nwould you take the money\nif no\nthen you've basically decided\nthat any loss damage or inconvenience\nthat is worth less than 500\nisn't worth getting angry about\nit's like how much would you need to be\npaid in order to abide in anxiety\ndespair rage how much would someone need\nto pay you to stay there for days weeks\nor even months at a time\nthat's the price of your piece\nand it's important to value peace highly\nbecause it's actually a rare and\nprecious thing\ni hope that made sense if you're\nwatching on youtube or instagram please\ndrop a comment below and if you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psychexpodcast gmail.com thanks\nfor listening"
