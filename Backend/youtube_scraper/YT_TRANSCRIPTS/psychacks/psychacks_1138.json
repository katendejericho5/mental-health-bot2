    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nthe topic of today's short talk is\nwanting is free i like this phrase\nwanting is free and i'm going to explain\nwhy in this episode\nthere are two ways of looking at this\nphrase the first is when someone else\nwants something\nthe second is when you yourself are\ndoing the wanting\nlet's break it down\nwhen someone else wants something\nespecially\nwhen someone else wants something from\nyou\nit's important to always remember\nthat wanting is free\nthat is\nit cost this someone\nabsolutely nothing to want this\nsomething from you your agreement your\ncompliance your understanding\nthey're free to want whatever they want\nand from a purely economic perspective\nit makes a lot of rational sense for\nothers to want things from you because\nagain that wanting cost them nothing\nand that wanting can sometimes obtain\nthe desired result\nbut in my mind this also makes it easier\nto reject\ndisappoint and otherwise turn down\npeople's desires since it cost them\nnothing to want to begin with you're not\nreally hurting them by saying no\nin tort law we could say that no loss or\nharm has occurred as a result so that's\none way to look at it\nanother way to look at the phrase\nwanting is free\nis from your own perspective that is\nwhen you yourself want something well\nagain wanting is free\ngetting\nis expensive\nso if you pass your time just wanting\nthings but not spending any of your time\nenergy or money in the pursuit of your\ndesires then\nyou're you're not understanding how this\nworks\ngetting\nis expensive\nif you want to start getting\nyou have to start spending\nthis doesn't necessarily mean money\nbut you have to spend resources broadly\ndefined in order to obtain the objects\nof your desire okay\nhope that helps\nif you are watching on youtube or\ninstagram please drop a comment below\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you later"
