    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nspeak what you want\ninto being\nlook\nspeech is magic i mean if you think\nabout it what are we really doing when\nwe speak\nby squeezing certain muscles in our\nlarynx we can vibrate particles of our\nexhaled breath such as they vibrate\nother particles propagating distributed\npatterns of energy through the air until\nsuch patterns are filtered into someone\nelse's inner ear and cause the little\nsilly in their cochlea to bend thereby\ntransmitting electrical impulses to the\nauditory processing center in their\ntemporal lobes which will reconstitute\nthose neuronal firings into hallucinated\nsounds which are recognized as concepts\nand in that way\nby squeezing my muscles\nin just the right manner\ni can literally put thoughts into your\nmind\ni'm doing it right now\ni can conjure things into existence by\nuttering the correct sequence of sounds\nit's an amazing power to be able to\nspeak\nin fact this is the meaning of the\nmagical phrase abracadabra it's a little\ncheesy now but abracadabra originally\nliterally meant\ni create as i speak\nso we see in that phrase the magical\nelement of the spoken word\nso this brief talk is about speaking\nwhat you want into being and i'm here to\noffer two simple tricks for doing just\nthat effectively the first is to use\nyour language to trap yourself\nsuccessfully that is to trap yourself\nfor your own good\nunfortunately we're often subject to\nusing our language to sabotage our\nprocess and the most frequent means by\nwhich we do this is by offering\nourselves\neasy ways out\nso for example\nwe might say something like i'll try to\ngo for a run tomorrow\ni mean\nwhat a soft statement\nif the threshold of successful action is\nmerely the attempt then how can we truly\nfail\nthat said you might not end up with\nanything worth having either\nthis type of language gives you a lot of\nopportunity to fail successfully\nand it does that by giving you an out\nyou don't actually have to run you just\nhave to try to run you see\ncontrast this with a statement like i\nwill go for a run tomorrow\nwell\nnow you're trapped by your own language\nnow you can actually fail\nbut the possibility of actual failure\nmight functionally increase the\nlikelihood that you engage in the\nintended behavior if for no other reason\nthan to avoid failing\nwhen you use phrases like i will do this\nor this will happen\nyou firm your intention into a\ncommitment which will make it more\nlikely to occur\nand if it's a commitment to a behavior\nin the service of your success\nthen why create loopholes that would\nallow yourself to break the commitment\nwithout consequence it doesn't make\nsense\nthe second trick when speaking what you\nwant into being is not speaking what you\ndon't want into being this means\nworrying complaining gossiping\nsomeone once said that worrying is like\npraying for something you don't want to\nhappen\nand i think that's true\non a side note i looked up who this\nsomeone was and apparently it was\nrobert downey jr go figure i don't i\ndon't know if that's an rdj original or\nif you got it from somewhere else but\nthat's what the fact checkers say so\nthanks robert downey jr it's a good\nphrase\nwhen you worry or complain you're giving\nthe undesired outcome time energy money\nand whatever we feed in this way gets\nlarger\nso rather than ruminate on what you\ndon't want\nor speak on the things that we fear\nmight transpire\nuse your words to cultivate desired\noutcomes and bring what you want into\nbeing\ni hope this helps\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcasts or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode and if\nyou're watching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
