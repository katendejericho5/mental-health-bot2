    "transcript": "punishing people for making an effort is\none of the shest ways to people up\npsychologically the people who are\npunished for doing what they are\nsupposed to do can become villainous not\na good idea it's also incredibly\ncounterproductive with respect to your\nchosen goals it's like fool me once\nshame on you fool me twice you ain't\ngoing to fool me again if you want to\ninfluence your partner to do what you\nwant them to do then you're going to\nhave to be patient you're going to have\nto be kind and you're going to have to\nbe generous and if you can't be those\nthings for whatever reason you probably\nshouldn't try to influence their\nbehavior because you're probably just\ngoing to it up and make it harder for\neverybody it's very difficult to change\na pre-existing Habit in some cases it's\nactually a better idea to just break up\nand start over with someone who is\nnaturally closer to the behavior you\nhave in mind than to try to shape a\npre-existing partner in the direction of\nthat goal if that behavior is that\nimportant to you"
