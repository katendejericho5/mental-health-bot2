    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nsleep and death\nin greek mythology\nhypnos the god of sleep and thanatos the\ngod of death were twin brothers\ni like to keep this in mind when i work\nwith folks with death anxiety the fear\nof dying\nand i actually find that this fear is\nmore prevalent among young people than\nit is among old people\neven a child can think\none day i will die\nbut a full emotional appreciation of the\nfact that one's own death is unavoidable\nand inescapable generally occurs in the\nlate teens to early 20s\nand this can be quite difficult to pass\nthrough\nmany will ultimately see this as a\npositive experience however few would\nlikely argue that it's a comfortable one\nnow\nas i've said\nyounger people tend to fear death more\nthan older people why is that\nwell from the perspective of the 20 year\nold death which at least could\npotentially occur at any time\nwhere to come now would take 60 70 good\nyears of life\ncontrast that with the 80 year old who\nmay already have lived a full and happy\nlife this isn't to say that 80 year olds\naren't or can't be afraid of death but\nin their cases there just is less time\nleft to lose\nso the stakes are lower relative to the\nyounger person\neven though the 20 year old is at\nsignificantly less risk of dying than is\nthe 80 year old that's not always how\ndeath is held psychologically\nand the concept of stakes indicates why\nthis might be the case so this is where\ndeath anxiety in young people comes from\nnow\nwhy else might an 80 year old have less\ndeath anxiety well i think for a similar\nreason why we generally don't resist\nsleep at the end of a long day\nif it's 11 a.m and we're forced to go to\nbed we would probably protest\nhe wouldn't be tired yet and we would\nlikely still have more to do\nbut if we were to work all day\nuntil arriving in the evening with a\nfeeling of connection and accomplishment\nif it were if we were in short to feel\nas though our time were spent well then\nsleep becomes a welcome respite\nit's something that most of us even look\nforward to at the end of the day sleep\nis rest after a day well spent\nwell that's potentially true both on the\nscale of a day\nand on the scale of a life\nand to bring it back around i think\nthat's why sleep and death are twin\nbrothers in greek mythology\nthe practice of embracing sleep at the\nend of the day\nis training\nfor embracing death at the end of our\nlives\nsleep\nis practice for death\nsince the two are twins that is\npractically indistinguishable\nand the best way to approach death is\nalso the best way to approach sleep\nas a welcome rest at the end of\nwell-spent time\nso don't hold back\nuse your time while you have it folks\nhopefully that makes sense if you're\nlistening on apple podcasts google\npodcast or spotify please like rate and\nreview this episode and if you're\nwatching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below finally if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat cychaxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
