    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to be more disciplined here we are\nin january 2022\npeople have goals for the coming year\nresolutions with respect to habits they\nwould like to adopt and vices they would\nlike to disabuse themselves of\nand all of these things require some\nmeasure of discipline for their\naccomplishment\nin today's episode i'm going to tell you\na very very effective hack for\nincreasing discipline with respect to\nany new habit you're attempting to\ncultivate\nit's psychologically true that human\nbeings will do more to avoid pain\nthan they will do to secure pleasure\nthis is why the stick is generally more\nincentivizing than the carrot some\ncarrots are good it's good to reward\nyourself and important milestones on the\npath to your goal but especially if\nyou're serious about achieving your goal\nit's also good to have sticks in your\ncontingency program as sticks tend to\nmotivate more consistently and\nenergetically than do the carrots\nnow i'm going to tell you how to do this\nit works 99.99\nof the time so it's basically a sure\nthing\nthe catch and there's always a catch\nis that people don't like to do it\nbut i'm here to tell you that it's\npractically guaranteed to increase your\nmotivation so if you're serious about\nyour goals it's something to seriously\nconsider\nit goes like this\nfirst\nthink of a group that you dislike\nthis could be a political organization\nor a religious institution or a\nnon-profit company it doesn't matter so\nlong as it's a legal entity\nnext\nyou're going to create a situation and\nyou might need some help from a friend\nor a parent or spouse for accountability\nhere\na situation where every day or every\nweek or every month you can decide the\ntime period\nthat you fail to execute the desired\nhabit\nyou will be forced to donate a certain\namount of money to that disliked\norganization\nthis means that the only way you can\navoid not paying the money is by\nsuccessfully executing the habit that\nyou're attempting to cultivate\nthis is called an escape contingency\ndevious isn't it\nnow\nwhen it comes to setting a penalty you\nwant to pick an amount that will\nactually hurt\nwe don't want it to break your bank but\nyou should feel the money leaving your\naccount it should sting especially since\nthe money will be going to that disliked\norganization\non certain days you might not feel like\nexecuting the desired habit\nbut i can almost guarantee that you'll\nfeel even less like cutting a check to\nthat political party\nthis\nreally really works and it works because\nwe're creating a cost associated with\navoidance that is even greater than the\npain associated with compliance\ni hope this helps and if you've ever\ntried this technique please drop a\ncomment below i'd love to hear from you\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsycaxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
