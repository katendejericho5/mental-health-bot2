    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nbet on yourself\ni heard this phrase recently from one of\nmy clients and it really resonated with\nme the moment i heard it the phrase\nimmediately made me think of the\nbaseball great pete rose for those who\ndon't know\npete rose holds the all-time major\nleague baseball record for total hits he\nhas more hits than any other player in\nthe history of major league baseball\nhe also won three world series\nchampionships with the cincinnati reds\nand went on to manage the team for\nseveral years i mean extremely\nimpressive guy\nhowever pete has also since been\npermanently banned from baseball\nin the baseball hall of fame where he\nvery likely belongs\nbecause he was betting on his games\nwhile acting as manager\nthat said pete's defense to these\ncharges is and has always been that he\nonly ever bet on the reds to win\nnow if he had ever been on the reds to\nlose there would have been an obvious\nconflict of interest with the\npossibility that he would have tried to\nthrow some of his games in order to make\nsome extra cash\nbut by betting on the reds to win\nhis goals as an individual gambler and\nas a team manager were aligned\nif anything his wagers might have\nincentivized him to be an even better\nmanager for his players\ni like this phrase to bet on yourself\nfor two reasons\nfirst\nwhen we bet on when you bet on yourself\nyou demonstrate at least to yourself and\nthat's no small thing\nthat you are confident in your own\neventual success it's like all things\nbeing equal i think i can do it i\nbelieve that i can win\nthat's important\nif you don't think you can do it\nwhy the heck would anybody else think\nyou could do it you at the very least\nhave to think that you can do it\nthe second reason why i like this phrase\nis that it incentivizes successful\naction\nwhen you bet on yourself you have some\nskin in the game this could look like\nsigning up for that course on business\ndevelopment or moving to a new city or\nrunning for elective offices elected\noffice when you do these things you're\nbasically saying i've got some money on\nthe felt now so i'm even more focused on\nand motivated toward a successful\noutcome\nbetting on yourself i think it's a\nreally useful idea\ni hope this helps if you're listening on\napple podcasts google podcasts or\nspotify please like rate and review this\nepisode and if you're watching on\nyoutube please drop a comment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
