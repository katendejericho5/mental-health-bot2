    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe town liar lies\nso this is a concept that i like to keep\nin mind whenever i'm personally dealing\nwith or helping someone else deal with\nthe frustrating or disappointing\nbehavior of others and the metaphor that\ni like to use in these situations is\nthe town liar lies\nthat's what the town liar does the town\nliar lies if you go to the town liar\nexpecting to hear the truth\nat a certain point it's your own damn\nfault if you get your feelings hurt over\nbeing lied to\nthat's because the town liar\nlies by definition the town hater hates\nthe town cheater cheats the town whiner\nwhines and the town gossip gossips it's\nwhat they do\nnow when i present this metaphor to my\nclients often i get a little bit of\npushback at this point\ntypically in the form of a moral\nrebuttal well\nthey shouldn't do that they they\nshouldn't lie\nwell\ni'd like to argue that a liar should lie\nlying is what makes the liar a liar the\ncheater should cheat\nif the cheater didn't cheat the cheater\nwouldn't be a cheater\nif the whiner didn't wind the whiner\nwouldn't be a whiner and so this line of\nreasoning makes no sense\nliars should lie haters should hate and\nso on\nand then we get to the real crux of the\nproblem\ndisbelieving that the town liar is\nactually a liar that the town gossip is\nactually a gossip etc\nthere's a refusal to accept reality in\nthis regard\nand my response to that is generally\nlook\nif it looks like a duck\nand walks like a duck\nquacks like a duck\nit's probably a duck\nso if this is someone who talks like a\nliar and acts like a liar\nand lies like a liar\nthen it's probably a liar more likely\nthan not right\nbelieving that something that looks and\nwalks and quacks like a duck could be\nand should behave like an eagle or a\npenguin or an ostrich makes no sense at\nall\nat bottom of this frustration we\ndiscover as is often the case an\nunwillingness to accept a certain aspect\nof reality this is what gets us into\ntrouble\nhowever by continuing to increase our\nacceptance of reality of what is over\nand above what should be\nwe typically become less frustrated and\nmore effective\nand that's what i got to say about that\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcast or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode and if\nyou're watching on youtube please drop a\ncomment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
