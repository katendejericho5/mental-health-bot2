    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic today's short talk is\ndealing with indirect requests i gotta\nadmit this is one of my pet peeves\ni'm not a big fan of indirect\ncommunication while i understand that\nthere is a time and a place for\nsuggestion\ni'll take direct straight talk any day\nof the week\nand nowhere\ndoes indirect communication seem to\ncause more trouble than in our romantic\nrelationships here's a simple example\nyou're sitting in your living room and\nyour partner turns to you and says\noh it's cold in here\nnow is this simply an observation on the\nambient temperature\nor is this an indirect request to turn\nthe heat up\nand that's why i personally find\nindirect communication distasteful it\nprotects the indirect communicator at\nthe expense of the other party why is\nthis\nwell in the first place if you never\nmake an actual request you can never be\nrejected after all you're not actually\nasking for anything\nso it protects the indirect communicator\nfrom this possible outcome\nand in the second place you retain\nplausible deniability\nso if the other party reads between the\nlines assumes the implied request and\ndenies the implied request or wrangles\nat the attempted manipulation then the\nindirect communicator can argue that\nthere was no request and why do you\nalways assume i'm asking for something\nit's a no lose situation for the\nindirect communicator and potentially a\nno-win situation for the other party so\nit's kind of a selfish way to interact\nwith other people and it can be very\nfrustrating to deal with\nso if this is an issue that's coming up\nin your relationship\nyou might have to kind of retrain your\npartner to be a more direct communicator\nhere's the best way i found to do that\nif you hear a statement that you\nperceive to be an indirect request\nthen your best move is to ask an honest\nclarifying question\nso for example in this case if your\npartner says\nit's cold in here\nyou could potentially respond by asking\nare you asking me to turn the heat on\nthe key here is to ensure that this\nremains an honest question by watching\nyour tone\nbecause if you come off as sarcastic or\nirritable it's probably going to provoke\ndefensiveness so phrase it as an honest\nquestion are you asking me to turn the\nheat on\nif the tone is correct\nthat honest question will often prompt\nthe other party to rephrase the initial\nstatement as a direct request if that\nwas in fact the intention like oh yeah\nwould you please turn on the heat\nand then of course you're free to\nrespond as you like\nthough when people make reasonable and\npolite direct requests of us\nwe're generally much more amenable to\nconcession so this strategy is generally\ngood for both parties and the more we\nset up win-win communication\nopportunities with our partner the\nbetter\ngive it a shot\nit might take some practice however\nasking honest clarifying questions in\nresponse to perceived indirect requests\ncan prompt your partner to be more\nmindful in asking for what he or she\nreally wants\nwhich is an essential relationship skill\nhope that helps if you're listening on\napple podcasts google podcasts or\nspotify please like rate and review this\nepisode and if you're watching on\nyoutube please drop a comment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychexpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
