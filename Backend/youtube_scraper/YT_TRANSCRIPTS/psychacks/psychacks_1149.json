    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\npersona 5 and confidants\nso this is another dive into pop\npsychology again with the fantastic rpg\npersona 5. this game does so many things\nright and in this episode\ni'd like to talk about how the game\nfunctionally lays down a blueprint on\nhow to make friends\nand this is something that i talk to my\nclients about\nevery single week\nthe fact of the matter is that the older\nyou get on some level the harder it\nbecomes to make new friends\nit's not like high school or college\nwhen people are just hanging out and you\ncan make spontaneous plans in adulthood\npeople have jobs people have families\nand relationships they're a bit more\nwary of folks and in many cases they\nalready have friends and family so\nthey're often not in the market to form\nnew friendships which as we'll see can\nbe time and energy consuming\nso it's hard to make new friends as an\nadult\nbut persona 5 lays out a pretty solid\ntemplate for how to do so\nfirst of all\nit's important to understand that to\nmake a friend you have to spend time\nwith them\nand in the game as in life\ntime is the most precious resource you\nhave\nobviously if you spend time with one\nperson the opportunity cost is that you\ndon't get a chance to spend that time\nwith anyone else\nwhich means that you deepen\nrelationships to a certain extent at the\nexpense of all other relationships you\nhave or might have\nso you have to spend time with people\nand this time will generally be spread\nout over months if not years\nit's really not possible to become close\nfriends with someone in less time\nso pace yourself for the long haul now\njust like in the game\neveryone starts as an acquaintance a\nclassmate a person in your community a\nchance encounter etc\nand you begin the path toward friendship\nwhen you take the first step to invite\nan acquaintance to a one-on-one\ninteraction that's the first step\nand usually that interaction revolves\naround an activity like with ryuji it's\ntraining you run or go to the gym with\nusuke it's art you go to a museum or to\nan inspirational location\nso that's another thing to keep in mind\nyou can't expect every acquaintance to\nenjoy every activity\nin the beginning\nthe burgeoning friendship is based\naround a shared interest\nand this becomes the common ground on\nwhich your relationship is based\nthis means that you have to pay\nattention to the interests temperament\nand personality of the people you're\ndealing with in order to propose\nactivities that might resonate with them\nand these factors are represented in the\ngame by the arcana associated with each\ncharacter which is a principle from the\ntarot which reveals let's say their\nessential nature\nso you need to spend time with people\none-on-one\nin an activity that reflects a shared\ninterest\nwhen this happens you tend to get\nsomewhat stereotyped compartmentalized\nrelationships this is my gym buddy this\nis my museum buddy etc\nthis isn't necessarily a problem however\nas this might be considered a necessary\nphase\ntoward deepening a friendship\nso how does that occur\nbasically\nstereotyped relationships are deepened\nby means of a gradual process of mutual\nrevelation\nin the first few interactions with\nsomeone you're both mostly going to be\ntalking about whatever you're there to\ndo\nlifting techniques artistic principles\netc\nbut then\nover time\npersonal details begin to emerge\npeople start to talk about things beyond\nthe present activity things that are\ngoing on at home in their personal lives\nor things that happen in their past\nand this is a key moment\nas it's basically a tentative invitation\nto greater intimacy\nand you can initiate this as well you\ndon't simply have to wait for the other\nperson to do it\nthe crux of the matter is determine\nwhether the intimacy is reciprocated in\nkind\nfor instance if the other person makes a\nself-disclosure and you don't mirror\nthis behavior with an appropriate\nself-disclosure of your own the\nrelationship is unlikely to progress\nhowever if you match your\nself-disclosure with an appropriate\nself-disclosure that is a\nself-disclosure about the same topic on\nthe same level of intimacy your\nrelationship will deepen\nthe path toward friendship is a sort of\ndance in which the steps are the matched\nreciprocity of self-disclosure\nand the last point i want to make is\nthat one of the best ways to accelerate\nthe process of intimacy in a\nrelationship is to overcome a challenge\ntogether\nthis is symbolized in the game by the\nfact that you generally have to\naccompany each of your confidants\nthrough a personal difficulty\nthere is a suffering to pass through or\na crisis to resolve\nand it's important to understand that\nyou don't actually have to eliminate the\nsuffering or mitigate the crisis either\nis really the other person's\nresponsibility\nyou simply accompany the person through\ntheir hardship with your steadfast\npresence\nthis is sufficient as it's actually\nquite a lot\nso an accelerant in intimacy is assuming\nshared hardship\nsomething to keep in mind\nthanks for listening if you're listening\non apple podcasts google podcasts or\nspotify
