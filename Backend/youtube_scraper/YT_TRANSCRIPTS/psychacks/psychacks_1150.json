    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhold people\nlike sand\ni remember some years ago i was at a\ngathering and i had the opportunity to\nobserve a nascent relationship\na woman who i had previously only known\nas a single person\nbrought her new boyfriend to the\ngathering i had never met the man before\nbut i had known the woman for several\nyears so it was my first time seeing\nthis woman in relationship\nand the way that she treated this man\nwas shocking to me\nthroughout the gathering she was\nconstantly criticizing his responses and\nmicromanaging his behavior and generally\ncorrecting his performance\nthe guy seemed pretty laid back and he\ndid his best to play it off but frankly\ni\ni had no idea how he put up with it\na few days later i pulled this woman\naside\nand i told her that if she continued to\nbehave like this her boyfriend would\nlikely leave her\nand the image that came into my mind in\nthat moment is that we have to hold\npeople like sand\nif you squeeze too tightly\nthe sand will just slip through your\nfingers\nand you'll end up losing what could\notherwise have been a valued\nrelationship\nhowever if you hold the sand loosely\nyou can actually hold a lot more for a\nlonger period of time\nno one likes to be controlled\nand when they inevitably become aware of\nthat intention\nmost people through a mechanism called\nreactants\nwill do what is necessary to reassert\ntheir autonomy and independence\nwhich in the case of relationships\nprobably means bye-bye\nand in fact this man did eventually\ndecide to end that relationship\nthis is really important\nto love someone well you can't be too\nloose but you certainly can't be too\ntight\nthis is really a form of respect\nand people aren't going to stay in\nrelationships where they don't feel\nrespected\nso if you want to have a stable loving\nlong-term relationship\nhold your partner like sand\ni hope that helps if you're listening on\napple podcasts google podcasts or\nspotify please like rate and review this\nepisode\nand if you're watching on youtube please\nlike and drop a comment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
