    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nsimple\nisn't easy\nnow every once in a while in the course\nof my clinical practice i get a little\npushback from clients who bulk at the\napparent simplicity\nof some of my proposed solutions for\ninstance\nin order to stop drinking you need to\nstop drinking\nor in order to stop procrastinating you\nhave to\nstop\nprocrastinating and all right fair\nenough this is obvious it's even\ntautological\nbut that doesn't mean it isn't true\ni mean abstaining from alcohol\nis the necessary and sufficient\ncondition to stop drinking\nif you do that and nothing else you will\nhave succeeded\nif you do everything else except that\nyou will have failed\nso what does this mean\nit means that the actual thing that\nneeds to change for a lot of people is\noften very very simple\nmost the time people even know what they\nneed to do to do it\nso what's the problem\nthe issue is that people are subject to\nconstructing a host of complexity as a\ndefense mechanism\nthat firmly embeds the problematic\nbehavior in their lives\nso a lot of the work that i do as a\ntherapist is to slowly and\nsystematically work to dismantle the\nunnecessary complexity that holds\nmaladaptive behaviors in place\nfor instance\nwhen you speak with an alcoholic there's\nalways a reason why he just can't stop\ndrinking\nwhen ultimately that's exactly what\nhe will have to do if and when he's\nready to move forward with that decision\nthere's always a reason why a person\nwill stop procrastinating\ntomorrow\nand those reasons which are often the\nproduct of distorted thinking\nare what defend the problematic behavior\nfrom intervention\nso part of the work is to\ncollaboratively discuss the truth and\nutility of some of these beliefs\nnow simple doesn't mean easy\nif simple meant easy then you'd already\nbe doing it\nsimplicity is a skill\nand it's a sign of mastery\nleading artists and scientists are\ndistinguished by their ability to\nexpress complex ideas in a simple and\nstraightforward manner none of us starts\nthere\nhowever it's a destination we can arrive\nto\nwith training guidance and repetition\nso the work here is to move in the\ndirection of greater simplicity by\nshedding the unnecessary complexity that\nmay be making our lives harder than they\nreally need to be\nthanks for listening\nif you're listening on apple podcasts\ngoogle podcasts or spotify please like\nrate and review this episode and if\nyou're watching on youtube please like\nand drop a comment below\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychxpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
