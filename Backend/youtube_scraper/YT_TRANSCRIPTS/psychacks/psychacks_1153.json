    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nattend to your soil\nso this is building on an episode i\npublished some time ago called be a\nruthless gardener\nin that talk i made the analogy between\none's consciousness or mental state in a\ngarden\nand that it's up to each one of us to\nderacinate to pull up by the roots the\nuseless and negative thoughts that\nproliferate like weeds in our minds\njust like in a garden these thoughts\ntake up space that could otherwise be\nallocated to more useful and attractive\nspecimens\nand much like a gardener who feels no\npity sympathy or remorse about pulling\nweeds you can likewise feel no pity\nsympathy or remorse about attending to\nthese negative thoughts\nnow on top of this though\nit's important to attend to your soil\nwhat does that mean\nwell some soil conditions are far more\nconducive to the growth of weeds than\nothers\nand if you simply limit yourself to\npulling up the weeds that sprout in your\ngarden without addressing the conditions\nfrom which they arise then you will\nlikely end up doing much more work over\nthe long run than you would otherwise\nneed to\nnow the soil is the environment in which\nyou live the environment from which\nthoughts emerge think about it\nare you more likely to experience\npositive confident and hopeful\ncognitions when you're tired or\nwell-rested\nwhen you're stressed or at peace\nwhen you're hungry or well-fed\nwhen you're hungover or sober\nwhen you're around disrespectful people\nor supportive friends\nwhen you're around users and enablers or\nsecure and interdependent partners\ni mean i think the answers are pretty\nobvious\nof course it takes time and effort to\ncultivate say inner peace or supportive\nfriendships\nhowever it also takes time and effort\nand potentially much more time and\neffort\nto continually cope with the\nconsequences of not doing so\nyou'll be pulling out weeds left and\nright if you don't work to change the\nsoil from which they emerge\nwith the right soil conditions you might\nnot have to pull so many weeds which is\nvery useful\nso how do you attend to your soil well\nin particular i'd like you to focus on\nyour social environment\nif you hang around five guys who sit on\nthe couch and smoke weed every night\nwell guess what it's only a matter of\ntime before you're the sixth\non the other hand if you surround\nyourself with people who know you who\ncare about you who support your growth\nand progress\nand who share your primary values\nthen you will be supported in becoming a\nbetter version of yourself you won't\nhave to do as much maintenance to cope\nwith the consequences of their company\nthere will simply be fewer weeds to pull\ni hope this helps if you're listening on\napple podcasts google podcasts or\nspotify please like rate and review this\nepisode and if you're watching on\nyoutube please like and drop a comment\nbelow\nfinally if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
