    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nbe afraid of your fear\nthat is be more afraid of the fact that\nyou are afraid than of anything you\nmight be afraid of\nby using fear in this way you can\nharness a powerful motivator for\nconstructive behavioral change\nso i'll tell you a little story\nmany years ago i wanted to overcome my\napproach anxiety\ni wanted to be able to go up to the\nattractive women that i saw on the\nstreets or in the bars and strike up a\nconversation with them to get their\nphone numbers and ask them out\nthe problem was of course that when i\nsaw an attractive woman i would get\nanxious hesitate in my approach and get\ntwo in my head\nusually what would end up happening was\nthat i would leave without saying\nanything\nand that would generally cause me to\nfeel very schmucky about myself\nand even when i set the intention to\novercome this approach anxiety this\nwould continue to happen\ni'd put on my suit get all hyped up and\ngo out to bars with the express\nobjective of picking up women however\nwhen i got there i couldn't screw up the\ncourage to talk to a single one\ni'd spend two three hours in a bar\nand then go home feeling like a schmuck\nthis happened five six seven times with\nthe exact same outcome and i ended up\nfeeling so\npathetic\ni'd be back at home alone\nlonely and beating myself up for being\nsuch a coward\nand every time this happened i would\nfeel a little worse than the time before\nbut i didn't give up\nnow at some point maybe it was the\neighth or ninth time we're going out\nsomething changed\ni was at a bar and i saw an attractive\nwoman and i felt an authentic desire to\napproach her so far so good\nand then suddenly instead of the usual\nself-consciousness that would arise at\nthis point what came into my mind very\nclearly\nwas everything that happens when i don't\napproach\nthe self-pity the loneliness the\ncowardice the frustration the despair\ni knew for sure\nthat if i were to succumb to my fear in\nthat moment that that is what was in\nstore for me i knew that with 100\ncertainty because it had already\nhappened nine times in a row why would\nthe tenth time be any different\nand i began to feel afraid of that\noutcome\ni began to fear feeling like a schmuck\nthis was interesting because fear\ncontains a behavioral impulse to avoid\nbut by becoming afraid of the outcome\nassociated with my avoidance i was\nfunctionally avoiding avoidance\nif i approached the woman\ni didn't know what was going to happen i\ndidn't know if she was going to like me\nmaybe she'd laugh or throw her drink in\nmy face but i knew for sure what was\ngoing to happen if i didn't approach her\nat that moment i became more afraid of\nthat inevitability than of anything that\nwoman could possibly have said or done\nto me and that is how i began to get\nover my approach anxiety i had to have a\nvery specific personal and powerful\naversion to doing\nnothing\nit's not that women became any less\nscary at that point\nbut rather that i became aware of\nsomething even scarier by comparison\nand i think this is generalizable to do\nsomething scary you kind of have to be\neven more afraid of not doing it the\nconsequences and meanings associated\nwith not doing it and the way to figure\nout what those are is to not do it and\npay attention to how your aversion makes\nyou feel\nthis will give you something to turn\naway from when the time is right and it\nturns out i've never had a woman so much\nas roller eyes at me let alone throw a\ndrink in my face\nof course i've been turned down a bunch\nof times but that really isn't that bad\nin fact i can say with confidence that\nbeing rejected feels significantly less\nbad than feeling like a schmuck\ni just had to get on the right side of\nfear\ni hope that was helpful if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
