    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion tarabam and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is do you\nwant your boss's job\nso most of us are not quite where we\nwant to be in terms of our respective\ncareer trajectories and this is normal\nsince we're talking about a process that\ncan often take years if not decades to\naccomplish\nwe're in a process of becoming\nand to this end it is\nvery very important to carefully examine\nwhether the path you're on will actually\ntake you where you want to go\nin the majority of cases the easiest way\nto do that is to ask yourself\nwould you want your boss's job\nif you continue on your current\ntrajectory the most likely outcome is\nthat one day\nyou will come to occupy your\nsupervisor's position\nis that position what you want\nlook carefully at what the person who\ncurrently occupies that role is doing\nthe actual duties and responsibilities\nwhat's the quality of this person's life\nlike\ndoes this person seem happy and\nfulfilled\nit's very easy especially when you're\nyoung and relatively new to business to\nidealize positions of power and\nprivilege in dominance hierarchies but\nthe truth is that it's not all fun and\ngames when you get up there\nin fact many of these folks are\noverwhelmed by demands responsibility\nand decision-making\nthey don't have good work-life balance\nand their roles often consume larger and\nlarger portions of their lives this is\noften due to the competitiveness of\nthese roles if they don't take on more\nthere will always be someone else who\nwill\nso for a lot of folks success actually\nproduces a rather joyless and stressful\nexistence\nthat said these folks are of course\ngenerally very well compensated however\nmany don't have time to spend the money\nthey work so hard to earn\nso their efforts often benefit others\nmore directly\nlook very carefully would you want your\nboss's job\nand if the answer is no\non some level you owe it to yourself to\nhave a really honest conversation with\nthe person in the mirror\nyou might need to course correct before\nyou invest even more years of your life\nto secure that outcome\ni mean if you don't want the prize don't\nplay the game\nplay a different game make sure that\nthat game has a prize you consider worth\nwinning\ni hope that makes sense if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening\nyou"
