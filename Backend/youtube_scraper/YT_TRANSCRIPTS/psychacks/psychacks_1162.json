    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nif you've done nothing wrong\ndon't apologize\nso\nit is sometimes the case that as we move\nthrough life\npeople might become angry or upset with\nus in response to something that we said\nor did or didn't say or didn't do\nand these folks will bring their hurt\nfeelings to our attention sometimes\ndemanding an\napology however the truth is that hurt\nfeelings are not in and of themselves\na sign of transgression\nif someone is upset with you it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you've done\nanything wrong maybe you have maybe you\nhaven't\nnow if folks bring their hurt feelings\nto you and you independently conclude\nafter examination in your own conscience\nthat the behavior they are indicting is\nin fact in conflict with your own moral\nor ethical beliefs\nthen such folks are your friends\nthey're pointing out something that you\nmay have missed or preferred not to see\nso that you can live in greater\nalignment with your own beliefs\nwhen this happens the right move is to\ndisabuse yourself with the behavior\napologize to those impacted and make\namends for any damages\nhowever\nif your independent examination\ncritically and dispassionately concludes\nthat the behavior they are indicting is\nnot\nin fact in conflict with your own moral\nor ethical beliefs\nthen you must conclude that you've done\nnothing wrong\nand in such cases you absolutely should\nnot apologize for that behavior\nthe issue here is that there are a lot\nof folks who are rather soft-hearted and\nconflict avoidant\nthey observe the other person's distress\nor discomfort they legitimately don't\nwant the other person to suffer\nand so they apologize in an attempt to\nreduce the other person's suffering\nsuch apologies are basically i'm sorry\nyou feel that way apologies which don't\nmake anyone feel any better\nin fact such compassionate apologies can\nmake the situation much\nmuch worse\nthis is because the person demanding the\napology can hear such an apology as an\nadmission of guilt\nan admission that the apologist has\ncommitted some form of wrongdoing\nand that the intentions imputed to the\napologist were correctly divined by the\nperson demanding the apology\nsuch an apology proves\nthat the apology demander was right\nfurthermore since apologizing is a\nconfession of guilt it often doesn't\nmollify the apology demander if anything\nthe apology can justify more punishment\nin the mind of the apology demander\nso only apologize if in your own\nconsciousness you conclude that you have\nin fact violated your own moral or\nethical code\notherwise anyone demanding an apology\ncan go pound sand\ni hope this helps if you like what you\nheard please drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychexpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
