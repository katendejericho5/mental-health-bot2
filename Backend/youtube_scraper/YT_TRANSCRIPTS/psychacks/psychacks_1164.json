    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\ncompromise versus sacrifice\ni'm not a big fan of compromise\nespecially in the context of romantic\nrelationships\nwhen i think about compromise\ni think two people not getting what they\nwant\nwell this might not be how it's supposed\nto work it's often how it does work in\npractice\nin a lot of relationships\ncompromise is a way of keeping score\nabout unhappiness\nit kind of goes like this\nwell i don't really want to spend next\nsaturday with your parents but you\nreally want me to be there\nso i'll agree to be unhappy for your\nsake in this case\nand that earns me the right to expect\nthat you'll agree to be unhappy for my\nsake at some future date when i want you\nto do something that you don't\nand in this way the couple moves forward\ninto the future and both participants\nincreasingly spend their time doing\nthings that half the couple doesn't want\nto do\nand i'm not entirely sure how such an\narrangement ultimately serves the\nindividuals in that relationship\nso i'm not a big fan of compromise for\nthis reason\non the other hand i am a big fan of\nsacrifice\nthe difference between compromise and\nsacrifice is that in a compromise you\nexpect something from your partner in\nreturn for your compliance\nnamely future reciprocated compliance\nhowever in a sacrifice you voluntarily\nchoose to alter your behavior for your\nown sake\nusually with the hope that you will\nreceive more benefit for yourself as a\nresult of the alteration\nlet me illustrate this with an example\nso imagine that one day your partner\ncomes to you and says i've noticed that\nyou've been playing a lot of video games\nyou play until 2 2 a.m you play 20 30\nhours a week\nand i'm not sure this is really good for\nyou\na compromise might be something like\nokay\nif i promise not to play during the week\nwill you agree to get off my case or\nif i'm not playing video games then you\nhave to stop going out with your friends\nas you can see the heart of compromise\nis negotiation\nand one partner generally sells\ncompliance for some future benefit from\nthe other\non the other hand if you were to take\nsome time to examine what your partner\nsaid because that person may in fact\nhave a point\nand you independently conclude that\nplaying video games like that isn't\nreally good for you that for example\nit's interfering with some of the other\nthings you want to do\nthen you can choose to voluntarily\nchange your behavior for your own sake\nin this case you would sacrifice playing\nvideo games in the hope that doing so\nwill accrue benefit to yourself\nin the form of say\nincreased opportunity to pursue other\ninterests\nsacrifice is saying i choose to give\nthis up because i hope to benefit\ncontrast this with compromise which says\ni agree to be unhappy because i hope to\nsecure compliance from you\nconsequently in sacrifice you don't\nexpect reciprocity from your partner on\nsome level your partner isn't even\ninvolved in this decision it's a\ndecision between you and yourself\nit's a selfish decision\nand the fact is that by making such a\nselfish decision you potentially improve\nthe interpersonal space in which the\nrelationship exists\nyou're choosing to change and expect\nnothing from your partner\nhow does that not improve freedom and\nrespect in a relationship\nfrom a certain perspective selfishness\nis exactly what is necessary to keep a\nrelationship healthy as it doesn't\nimplicate the other in the unhappiness\ndebt swapping of compromise\nin fact relationships become effortless\nto the extent that they're based upon\ncomplementary selfishnesses\ni hope you found that helpful if you\nlike what you heard please drop a\ncomment below and if you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psych hackspodcast gmail.com talk to\nyou soon\nyou"
