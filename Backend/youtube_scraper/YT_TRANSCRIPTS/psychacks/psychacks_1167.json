    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nif you're in the park you must have a\nticket\nthis talk will be a continuation of a\nprevious episode entitled life is like\ndisneyland in that episode i use\ndisneyland as a metaphor for life\nremember you can't do disneyland wrong\nif you want to ride all the rides once\nthat's the right way to do disneyland\nfor you\nif you want to ride space mountain 50\ntimes in a row that's the right way to\ndo disneyland for you\nif you just want to watch other people\nride the rides that's the right way to\ndo disneyland for you you can't screw up\ndisneyland and in a certain sense you\ncan't screw up your life you just get to\nchoose which rides you go on i.e which\nexperiences you choose to have\nso\nhopefully this metaphor helps to relieve\nsome of the pressure associated with\nquote living correctly\nthat said sometimes i talk with folks\nand they suffer from what you might call\nexistential uncertainty\nthey're not sure why they're here\nor even if they should be here\nand they feel as if they have to do\nsomething in order to justify their\nexistence\nthis could be getting married having\nchildren becoming rich\nsuccessful being loved and respected\nmaking their mark on history and or\nachieving something great and impressive\ni call these self-justification projects\nand they're all doomed to failure\nbecause you cannot solve an internal\nproblem with an external solution\nwhat i'd like you to consider is that\nyour life\nis already justified\nwhy\nbecause you're already here\nyou're already in the park\nat disneyland there are hundreds of\nworkers who are constantly employed in\nletting in those who should be in the\npark and keeping out those who shouldn't\nthere are fences and gates security and\nguards that exist to fulfill this\npurpose\ntherefore we can reasonably assume that\nanyone inside the park is there because\nthey had a ticket\nperhaps they're not really aware of\ntheir ticket because who really worries\nabout their ticket after it's been used\nto secure entry\nbut that doesn't mean that they aren't\nsupposed to be there\nif you're inside the park you must have\na ticket\nand if it's that hard to sneak into\ndisneyland how much harder do you think\nit must be to sneak into existence\nwithout the knowledge or approval of\nwhatever higher power or universal force\nis responsible for the gateway into\nbeing\nyou are not an exceptional oversight\nyou did not break and enter your way\ninto life\nand you are not the result of spiritual\nnegligence\nif you're here it's because you should\nbe\nnow you might not remember buying a\nticket\nand that's because most likely the\nticket was gifted to you\nyou certainly didn't earn the ticket as\nyou might not have existed previously\nand there's no need to repay the ticket\nas it was given as a gift of grace\nand this is a relief because what could\nyou possibly do in your life to repay\nthe debt associated with the opportunity\nto exist\nall the accomplishments and achievements\nin the world would not be sufficient\nit's a debt that\nit's not a debt that could be repaid\nwhich is why it's not a debt that must\nbe repaid\nyou can't get blood from a stone\ni'd like you to consider that the ticket\nwas a gift of grace\nfreely given\nthat needn't be earned or repaid\nand that you must have been gifted one\nby virtue of your own existence\nsince only people with tickets are\nallowed inside the park\nso this whole headache about proving\nthat you deserve to exist is totally\nunnecessary\nimagine spending the day at disneyland\ntrying to justify that you deserve to be\nspending the day there i mean what would\nthat even look like\nif you're already in the park there's\nnothing more that you need to do\nthough there might be plenty that you\nwant to experience\nthanks for listening if you like what\nyou heard drop a comment below and if\nyou'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
