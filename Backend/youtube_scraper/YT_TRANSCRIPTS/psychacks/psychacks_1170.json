    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe mind cannot decide\nthis is a limitation of the analytical\nthought process that is very important\nto appreciate especially if you're prone\nto using logic and reason as the\nprincipal tools by which to navigate\nreality\nso\nwhen we're confronted with a major\nchoice point in our lives it makes sense\nto collect information relevant to the\ndecision and to extrapolate possible\noutcomes associated with the options\navailable to us\ndoing both allows us to make informed\ndecisions correct\nhowever\nsometimes folks are subject to\noverreaching the capacities of the\nanalytical mind believing that it's\ncapable of actually making the decision\nfor them\nincorrect\nif we're honest the highest to which the\nanalytical mind can attain is the\ncalculation of odds ratios associated\nwith various outcomes given a model\nutilizing certain assumptions\nbasically assuming these things to be\ntrue and given the data that we have\nthere is a 87 percent chance that\noutcome a will obtain and a 42 chance\nthat outcome b will obtain and so on\nthat's the best the analytical mind can\ndo\nit cannot answer the question as to what\nyou should choose or whether something\nis worth doing\nthe answers to both of these questions\ndepend on value judgments and value\njudgments are irreducibly subjective\nsince they can't be objectively measured\nthey are non-quantifiable which means\nthey don't really lend themselves to\nquantitative analysis\nfurthermore your rational analysis will\nbe flawed\nbecause there will be inaccuracies in\nyour measurements and incomplete because\nthere will be unknown unknowns that were\nnot included among your assumptions and\nboth will inevitably skew the accuracy\nof your predictions\nthe decision\nto move forward is not an analytical\ndeduction\nit is an act of the will\ndecision is an act of the will\nand as such it's more emotional than\nrational\nit's like yup i've done my due diligence\ni know i have an 87 chance of success\ngiven my model of reality i know it\nmight work i know it might not work and\ni'm ready to roll the dice i'm good to\ngo i've decided\ndecision is a turning in a certain\ndirection as a result of a willful\nchoice\nso it's fine to use the analytical mind\nto do your due diligence in the service\nof that decision\nbut it's actually not rational to expect\nthat analysis to decide what you should\ndo this will likely only increase your\nconfusion and indecision\nappreciate the limitations of the\nanalytical mind and spare yourself the\nheadache\ni hope this helps if you like what you\nheard drop a comment below and if you're\ninterested in scheduling a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
