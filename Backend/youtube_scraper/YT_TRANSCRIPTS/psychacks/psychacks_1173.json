    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nassume you've already won\nthis is a belief i try to put into my\nmind whenever i enter into a difficult\nconversation or a delicate negotiation\nit makes me think of an excellent scene\nin an old movie called searching for\nbobby fisher which is a fictional\naccount of a young chess prodigy\nin this scene the protagonist is playing\nin the championship match of a\ntournament against his rival\nthe protagonist is able to look at the\nboard and recognize that he has\ncheckmate in 15 moves\nnow out of sympathy for his opponent the\nprotagonist offers his rival a draw\nhowever because his rival cannot see\nthat far ahead\nhe contemptuously dismisses the offer\nthat said the rival's inability to see\nthe reality of his own situation doesn't\nchange that reality one bit\nso the match plays out along the\npredetermined lines of action and the\nprotagonist eventually secures the\nvictory that had already been\nestablished\nnow once the protagonist recognized the\npath to checkmate there was no urgency\nin his action\nthere was no anger or irritation in his\ndemeanor on the contrary he seemed to\nfeel pity or compassion for his opponent\nwho was doomed to lose in light of that\nrecognition\nat times you might find yourself talking\nto folks who don't understand that\nthey've already lost\nhowever if you can approach these\nsituations with the attitude that you\ncan see clearly the pathway to victory\nthat in some sense you've already won\nand the other person just hasn't\nrealized it yet\nthen the fear and uncertainty are\nremoved from the exchange\nand when this occurs you can then\ncalmly and compassionately\nmove through the required steps to\nobtain the predestined outcome\nwhich can make that outcome more likely\nto occur even in situations where the\nresult isn't as guaranteed as a chess\nmatch\nthis belief allows me to approach\ndifficult conversations with an attitude\nof confidence and serenity\nboth of which are highly conducive to\nsuccess\nsomething to consider\nif you have any thoughts on the matter\nplease drop a comment below\nand if you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to you\nsoon"
