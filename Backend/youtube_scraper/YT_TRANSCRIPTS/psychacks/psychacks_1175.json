    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is cycax\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\ndon't try to change the weather\nwhy not\nwell among other things it's really not\npossible to do so\nrather than working to change the\nweather focus on becoming a better\nsailor\nthe better sailor you become\non some level the more irrelevant the\nweather becomes\nand this is because skillful sailors can\nuse most conditions to further their\ngoals\nwhat's more since improving your\nseamanship is actually within your\ndomain of control\nyou're much more likely to make progress\ntoward your identified goal this way\nof course you'll use due prudence wise\nsailors don't plunge heedlessly into\nvicious squalls without good reason but\nin general\nskillful sailors are concerned about\nprevailing conditions in inverse\nproportion to their level of competence\nin sailing\nmore competence less concern\nso this of course is a metaphor for\ninternalization and externalization\nwhen we externalize we attempt to\ncontrol the environment in order to\ncultivate or preserve preferred\nemotional states or conversely to reduce\nor eradicate unpreferred emotional\nstates\nhowever this is an expensive exhausting\nand ultimately futile endeavor\npredicated upon an unrelenting campaign\nof manipulation and control\nsince such methods tend to alienate and\noffend others over time\nthey're also not a good long-term\nsolution despite the seductiveness of\ntheir apparent short-term effectiveness\non the other hand when we internalize we\naccept the environment for what it is in\norder to cultivate or preserve preferred\npersonal virtues\nor conversely to reduce or eradicate\nunpreferred personal vices\nwe see each circumstance as an\nopportunity to rise to the occasion\nwhatever that occasion might be\nrather than put our trust in prevailing\nconditions\ninternalization empowers us to put our\ntrust in ourselves\nand in our ability to overcome\ndifficulties and tolerate discomfort\nsuch methods tend to attract and inspire\nothers over time\nso they are a good long-term solution\ndespite the fact that they might take a\nwhile to get off the ground\nso let the weather do what it wants\nfocus instead on continuing to become a\nbetter sailor\nthat's what i have to say for today if\nyou have a topic you'd like to suggest\nfor a future episode or you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychexpodcast gmail.com thanks for\nlistening"
