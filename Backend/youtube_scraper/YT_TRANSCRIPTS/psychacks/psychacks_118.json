    "transcript": "every woman on this planet possesses\nthese two versions of themselves and\nthis means that every woman on this\nplanet has to learn how to navigate this\nambiguity within themselves especially\nbecause women receive all kinds of\nconflicting messages about their\nsexuality from society some women\nattempt to resolve this ambiguity by\njust collapsing the dichotomy they're\nhyper controlled and generally hyper\ncontr controlling and they try to\ncivilize the bedroom as much as possible\nthere is no Wild West anymore just LA\nand order all the time under a Vigilant\nsurveillance State on the other hand\nthere are women usually young women who\ncollapse the dichotomy in the opposite\ndirection they're underregulation with\npoor boundaries and inappropriately\nsexualized interactions that have no\nbusiness being sexual with these women\nit's only the wild west and anything\ngoes as might be expected neither one of\nthese situations is particularly ideal\nand most women resolve this ambiguity by\nkind of compartmentalizing the two in\ndifferent dimensions of reality"
