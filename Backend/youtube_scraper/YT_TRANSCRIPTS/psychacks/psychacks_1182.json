    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nsuffering is expensive\nwhen i was in grad school\ni read a research paper on an experiment\nthat surveyed tens of thousands of\npsychotherapy patients in america on a\nnumber of issues\nand one of the survey items was the\namount of time\nthe psychotherapy patient spent\nsuffering from the problem for which he\nor she sought therapy before\nactually contacting the therapist\nand apparently on average\nan american experiences a problem for\n10 years\nbefore contacting a therapist 10 years\non average\nnow on some level this is understandable\ntherapy is expensive and we don't want\nto incur unnecessary expenses\nit's true that we can get stuck from\ntime to time in our lives but we often\nfind ways to get ourselves unstuck of\nour own accord\nand it's generally a good idea to make\nas much progress on our own regardless\nof the endeavor before enlisting the\nhelp of a professional\nthat said i was flabbergasted by this\nstatistic\n10 years is a very long time it's a\ndecade of time\nand we only have so many good decades in\nour life what six as an adult seven if\nwe're lucky\nten years is a significant portion of\none's life\nto suffer potentially unnecessarily\nbut with all this\nsometimes people balk at the cost of\ntherapy\nuh it's 200 bucks an hour it's\nand is it even really going to help you\nknow that kind of stuff\nnow one way that i ask folks to consider\napproaching this issue of cost is like\nthis\nthink about whatever problem you're\ndealing with right now\nif you could write a check for ten\nthousand dollars\nand this problem would just go away\nwould you do it\nthis is an interesting thought\nexperiment because if you're like um\nno maybe not 10 000 bucks then on some\nlevel you might be fortunate because\nmaybe you're not actually dealing with\nthat significant of an issue but if\nyou're like yes absolutely who do i make\nthe check out to then on some level\nyou're willing to spend at least that\nmuch money on a solution\nand ten thousand dollars is a year\nof weekly therapy at 200 an hour\nand that unlike the magic check in this\nthought exercise\ncould actually help to solve your\nproblem\nyou're obviously willing to spend the\nmoney and you could potentially save\nyourself nine years of unnecessary\nsuffering i might i mean you might not\neven need a year\nif you think about this in this way it's\nway\nmore expensive to suffer\nit's a useful thought exercise put a\nprice tag on the magical removal of your\nproblem that is actually your budget for\nsolving that problem\nhope this helps if you'd like to suggest\na topic for a future episode or you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psych's podcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
