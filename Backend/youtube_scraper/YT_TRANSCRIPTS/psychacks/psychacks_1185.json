    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is serial\nsevens\nserial sevens is something that i'm\nstealing from the psychiatric mental\nstatus exam which is something that\ndoctors use to very quickly assess basic\ncognitive functions\nand serial sevens is one of the best\ntechniques that i've discovered to\ndistract myself from unwelcome thoughts\nwe all have thoughts that sort of show\nup uninvited\nthoughts that if we attend to them\npredictably lead us to certain\nunpreferred emotional states whether\nthat's anger or jealousy or despair\nthese thoughts that show up uninvited\nare not our friends\nand the earlier we can disrupt the\nprocess that leads from thought to\nfeeling the less time we're gonna have\nto spend both residing in and coping\nwith the unpreferred emotional states\nand if they never get a chance to\nfluoresce at all well so much the better\nserial sevens is a technique that can be\nused to very quickly and effectively\ndistract ourselves when we become aware\nthat certain unfriendly thoughts have\nshown up uninvited in our consciousness\nso what is it\nserial sevens is very simple\nbasically you start with a random number\nlike 150 and you mentally try to\nsubtract seven from that number every\nsecond so it's like 150 143 136\n129 122 115 108 101 94\n[Music]\nyou can even speed it up if this is too\neasy for you now this is a challenging\ntask for most people because sevens\ndon't have an easily recognizable\npattern\nso it generally requires our focus and\nattention to implement this quickly\nand that's kind of the point the idea\nhere is to create a task that you can do\nanywhere\nat any time within your own\nconsciousness that actually consumes\nyour cognitive resources that's the\nsecret of serial sevens you're\ntemporarily making your situation more\ndifficult so that all of your\nattentional resources become absorbed in\nthis task that way there aren't any\nresources left over to attend the\nunfriendly thought that showed up\nuninvited\nso we want to observe all of our\nattention into this task we want it to\ncrescendo and then we actually want the\ntask to fail\nwhy is this\nbecause when we fail at a task that has\nabsorbed all of our attentional\nresources it's almost like a hard reboot\nafter a cpu crash\nit force closes any open applications\nand refreshes them to their normal\noperating settings\nand when our attention comes back online\nwhatever we were thinking about before\nisn't going to be there anymore that's\nthe whole point\nand the beauty of it is that this can\ngenerally be accomplished in 30 seconds\nor less\nserial sevens is entirely covert\ncompletely free\nand highly effective\ntry it out yourself\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nthat you'd like discussed in a future\nepisode or you'd like to schedule a\nconsultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
