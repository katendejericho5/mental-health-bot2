    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nthe three keys to effective boundary\nsetting\nso setting boundaries with other people\nis very important irrespective of the\nrelationship\nthis is because setting boundaries\nteaches people how to love and respect\nus without that feedback it's not really\npossible to reasonably expect to be\nloved and respected by other people in\nthe way that we would prefer without\nboundaries this would only happen by\naccident or coincidence\nso it's important to learn how to set\neffective boundaries with others\ni'm here to tell you that there are\nthree key components to effective\nboundary setting first be very specific\nwith respect to your target behavior\nask for what you want or what you don't\nwant\ni know these conversations can be\ndifficult but the vaguer and more\nindirect your language the easier it is\nfor misunderstanding to occur\nif you want your partner to stop\ndrinking say i want you to stop drinking\nif you want your friend to stop making\ndisrespectful jokes in public say i want\nyou to stop making disrespectful jokes\nin public\ndon't say something like i want you to\ntake better care of yourself or i want\nyou to be nicer to me\nthere are so many different ways that\nthose requests can be interpreted and\nthe vast majority of them won't result\nin changing the target behavior so it's\nimportant to be as specific as possible\nwith respect to defining the target\nbehavior\nthe second key is to create an\nactionable timeline\ntimelines are important because they\ngive a sense of urgency to the behavior\nchange\nwe want timelines to be reasonable but\nwe also don't want them to drag on for\ntoo long otherwise the whole point of\npriority is lost\nthis could mean something like if i\ndon't see some action in the direction\nof this goal by the end of the month\nthen\nor i need to stop by the end of the year\nor\nwe'll get to what comes next in a minute\nthat's the third key but the point here\nis that we want to have a very explicit\ntimeline in order to have an effective\nconversation about boundary setting\nand the third key is probably the most\nimportant\nyou need to have a clear consequence\nthat's within your control\nand that you're willing to execute\nin most relationships the best leverage\nyou have with respect to boundary\nsetting is to apply the consequence of\ntaking yourself out of the relationship\nit's like i can't control what you do\nbut i can control whether i continue to\nparticipate in this relationship that's\nalways your trump card and it's\neffective in direct proportion to how\nmuch you bring to the table if you're a\nloving partner or a competent employee\nthen refusing to participate in the\nrelationship will obviously be more\naversive than the converse\nthat said if you're not willing to walk\naway from the relationship for whatever\nreason\nthen don't nominate that as a\nconsequence only pick consequences that\nyou're actually willing to execute and\nfor that matter that you can reliably\nexecute because the consequence is\nwithin your domain of control\nso\nbe very specific when defining the\ntarget behavior create an actionable and\nrealistic timeline and identify a clear\nconsequence within your control that\nyou're willing to execute\nif you do all three\nyou're well on your way\ni hope this was helpful if you have a\ntopic that you'd like discussed in a\nfuture episode or you'd like to schedule\na consultation you can reach me at\npsychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to you\nsoon"
