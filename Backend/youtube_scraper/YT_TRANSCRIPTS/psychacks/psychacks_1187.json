    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is don't\nfeel guilty\nnow i'm going to approach this subject\nfrom a slightly unconventional angle\nwhich is basically this\nin the vast majority of cases\nguilt is a form of ineffective expiation\nso what does that mean\nxb8 kind of means to do penance\nto feel pain in order to absolve\nyourself of wrongdoing\nso generally when we do something that\nwe know we shouldn't have done\nor when we didn't do something that we\nknow we should have done\nthere's this tendency to engage in\nself-castigation beating yourself up in\nother words\nand the idea here is that if i inflict\nsufficient pain on myself well one no\none else will come to inflict more on me\ni'm hurting myself so you don't have to\nand two\ni can then remove the guilt from my\nconsciousness comfortably\ni don't have to feel bad anymore about\nwhat i did because i've already punished\nmyself for it\nso in this way guilt kind of has this\npotential to remove the pain associated\nwith wrongdoing from one's consciousness\nby inflicting another usually lesser\nform of pain in its place\nthe problem with this is that generally\nthe issue recurs\nand when it does you got to get out the\nold whip again and give yourself the\nlashes\nand this continued self-punishment can\nbe very exasperating both for yourself\nand the people around you because\nwithout addressing the underlying issue\nthe problem just keeps coming back\nso what i'm going to suggest is that\ninstead of feeling guilty\nyou strive to feel contrite\ncontrition is another word that we don't\nuse very often\nmaybe because like expiation it has\nslight religious undertones but it comes\nfrom the latin words khan meaning with\nand tristitia meaning sadness\nso contrition means with sadness\ncontrition means that we really allow\nourselves to feel the pain associated\nwith our behavior the pain we caused\nother people\nand the pain we really caused ourselves\nwithout substituting a lesser pain like\nguilt which is really a pain about pain\nin its place\nand the idea is that when we come into\ncontact with the pain of contrition\nwhich is more intense than the pain of\nguilt\nand we don't try to avoid feeling the\npain we caused others and ourselves\nit's usually unbearable and this\nexperience can motivate reality-based\nsustainable behavior change\nthis can include making amends to others\nbut it can also mean making a sincere\nenduring commitment to not repeat that\nbehavior\nnow that we've really emotionally\nexperienced the consequences of that\nbehavior\nso don't feel guilty because in many\nways that just lets you off the hook for\na repeat offense\nif you're serious about getting to the\nbottom of this\ninstead\nstrive to feel contrition\nby empathically entering into the\nexperience of others in order to feel\nthe emotional consequences of your\nactions\nthis will not only better repair your\nrelationships\nbut will set you up for more sustainable\nbehavior change moving forward\ni hope you found this helpful if you'd\nlike to suggest a topic for a future\nepisode or to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psycaxpodcast\ngmail.com thanks for listening"
