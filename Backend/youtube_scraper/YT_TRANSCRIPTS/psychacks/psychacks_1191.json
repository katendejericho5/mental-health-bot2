    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is the\nfunction of grief\ngrief if you've experienced it is just\nan extremely painful emotion i mean\ni don't think it's an exaggeration to\nsay that it can be excruciating\nit's one of the most intensely negative\nexperiences from a purely hedonic\nperspective a human being can pass\nthrough grief can be very challenging\nand having passed through grief a number\nof different times in my life i had to\nquestion\nwhy\nwhy does this exist\nwhy is the human heart the human mind\ncapable of experiencing so much pain\nit's like i get it can't it just stop\ncan't it be over already does it have to\nbe so painful for so long\nit's so difficult to deal with sometimes\nand this is something i really had to\nexamine because i don't like the idea of\nsuffering pointlessly of suffering\nwithout good reason so there has to be a\nreason behind the suffering associated\nwith grief at the very least a reason\nfrom an evolutionary perspective because\nbecause if grief had no function it\nwould have been selected out long time\nago\nand this is what i was able to come up\nwith\nbasically grief has to be painful\nit has to be as painful as it is because\nits function is to force a person to\nstop\nit has to be so painful that it causes\nlife to more or less grind to a halt\nanything less painful\nwould not cause a person to stop\ngrief forces people to stop so that they\ncan re-evaluate the structure of their\nlives\nand make changes in a reality-based way\nthat accommodate the loss of the loved\none\nwhat does this mean\nwe can all understand rationally\nintellectually that someone is gone but\nif we were to continue to live in such a\nway that we still on some level\nbelieved that that person might come\nback\nthat that person\nis still in our day-to-day lives\nthen we could run into some serious\nproblems further down the road\nfor instance we might count on a source\nof support that wouldn't actually be\nthere when we really needed it\nso the point of grief is to disrupt\nhabit\nthe habits that we had created over time\nin relation to the lost loved one\nits role is to force us to examine these\nhabits that have been integrated into\nthe structure of our lives\nand to make more intentional conscious\nchoices moving forward\nthat way we can develop a new structure\nto get our needs met without relying on\nthe lost loved one anymore\nso grief is actually in the service of\nour survival our long-term survival\nthough that of course is presuming that\nwe use grief appropriately that is for\nthat purpose\nif we believe on some level that grief\nis just this cruel and sadistic torment\nthat rubs salt in the wound of the\nperson left behind\nthen on some level we're still gonna\nsuffer\nbut we're gonna suffer for no good\nreason\nso this is the possibility\nfor grief to redeem our lives\ni hope this helps\nin the meantime if you'd like to suggest\na topic for a future episode or you'd\nlike to schedule a consultation you can\nreach me at psychxpodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
