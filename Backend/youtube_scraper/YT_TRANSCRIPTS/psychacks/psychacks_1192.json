    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nemotions and mastery\namong other things emotions are tools\ngiven to us by evolution to facilitate\nour survival\nand this is because contained within\nevery emotion is a behavioral impulse\nthat has persisted to the present day in\nlarge part because the ancestral\norganisms that relented to this impulse\nwere more likely to survive and\nreproduce all things being equal than\nwere those organisms who were limited to\na different impulse\nas a rule the stronger the emotion the\nmore difficult it is to resist the\nemotional impulse contained therein\nhowever there are folks who find it very\nchallenging to resist their emotional\nimpulses across the board so let's talk\nabout this\nthe fact that matter is that it's\ngenerally only a good idea to relent to\nan emotional impulse if it arises in the\ncontext of a domain of mastery\nwhat does this mean\nwell let's take as a concrete example\nthe domain of chess\nif you're a chess beginner if you just\nlearn the way the pieces move and what\nthe victory conditions are then it's\nprobably a terrible idea to let your\nemotions influence your decisions you\ncan't really think to yourself hmm i\nhave a strong feeling that it would be\nbest if the horse he went over here and\nexpect that you're actually going to win\nthe game\non the contrary if you're in the process\nof learning how to get good at chess\nit's generally a good idea to doubt your\nemotional impulses\nand to scrutinize them with respect to a\nrationally explicated model of reality\nsome kind of chess strategy or principle\non the other hand if you happen to be a\nchess grand master and you've played a\nhundred thousand games\nthen you will be able to feel through\nyour intuition\nwhat the next best move might be\nwithout being able to explicate a\nspecific rationale for this feeling\nand that's because the emotional impulse\nin this case arises out of years if not\ndecades of unconscious procedural\nknowledge and deep pattern recognition\nso it makes sense for the grand master\nwithin his domain of mastery to relent\nto emotional impulses that arise from\nthat knowledge base\nwhereas the beginner who does not yet\nhave such a knowledge base\nshould submit his emotional impulses to\nrational scrutiny\nnow what does this mean for us\nwell our mastery is not evenly\ndistributed over all domains\nthe grand master might not have mastery\nin the domain of dating in relationships\nand vice versa\nthere are parts of our lives where we\nhave more mastery than others and it's\nimportant to recognize when we happen to\nbe in those domains as this is our cue\nto relent more uncritically to our\nemotional impulses since they've been\npractically vetted by years of survival\nand if we happen to not be in one of\nthose domains then we can and should\nexercise greater skepticism with respect\nto the wisdom of those same\nimpulses i hope this helps in the\nmeantime if you'd like to suggest a\ntopic for a future episode or you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psychexpodcast gmail.com thanks\nfor listening\nyou"
