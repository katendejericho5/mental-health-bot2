    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is the\ngame of please know\nmany of you might not know that\npsychology is actually my second career\ni got my start as a theater actor and i\nwas a professional actor for over a\ndecade in new york city\ni began this career at a very\nprestigious acting conservatory there\nand for the entire first year of my\ntraining my acting class was entirely\ndevoted to one single exercise which was\ncalled the game of please know\nand i've since come to understand the\ngame of please know is the fundamental\ngame of human interaction\nso i'd like to briefly describe what\nthis game entails and why i think the\nway that i do\nthe game of please know is very simple\nit's always played between two people\none person can only say the word please\nand the other person can only say the\nwords yes or no\nand this person has to start from a no\nposition\nthe game is over when the please actor\nsuccessfully persuades the no actor to\nsay yes\nthat's it\nno other words are allowed and the game\ncan go on as long as it needs to\namong other things this game is an\nexcellent way to develop non-verbal\ncommunication skills tonality proxemics\nposture gesture rhythm pacing etc\nhowever the aspect of the game that i\nwant to focus on today is its relation\nto the negotiation at the heart of all\nhuman interactions in the real world\nas i've mentioned in a previous episode\nthe universe lives closed which is to\nsay that the default starting position\nof the universe is no\ncan i have this job no can i have this\nhouse no can i have this date no\nand at the end of the day people are\nsuccessful in life in direct proportion\nto their ability to transform no's into\nyeses\nor to put it another way in direct\nproportion to their mastery of the game\nof please know\nif you ever decide to play this game\nyourself you'll very quickly learn that\nsuccess is not a one size fits all thing\nthe same game played between the same\ntwo individuals on one day will have a\nvery different progress and potential\noutcome than the same game played\nbetween the same two individuals on\nanother\nover time you'll also see that the\nvarious methods or strategies utilized\nby the please actors to secure their\nyeses are varied but not infinite\nin fact they tend to fall into a few\neasily identifiable general categories\nsuch as seduction\nintimidation\nhumor\nsupplication earnestness etc\nand these strategies will work\ndifferentially on different people on\ndifferent days\nthe trick to mastering the game of\nplease know is being able to suss out as\nquickly and reliably as possible\nthe strategy that is most likely to be\neffective in that particular moment with\nthat particular individual\nand you do this\nby learning to listen more carefully to\nthe no response\nand becoming more sensitively perceptive\nto the information contained therein\nbecause the fact of the matter is that\nthe way a person says no always contains\na clue\nabout how to get them to say yes\nprovided you know how to listen\ni think that's good for an introduction\nwe'll definitely talk about the game of\nplease know in future episodes in the\nmeantime if you'd like to suggest a\ntopic for a future episode or you'd like\nto schedule a consultation you can reach\nme at psych hackspodcast gmail.com\nthanks for listening"
