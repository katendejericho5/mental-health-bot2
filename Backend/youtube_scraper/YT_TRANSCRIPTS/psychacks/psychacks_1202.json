    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the coin\nflip technique i like the coin flip\ntechnique it's very useful when dealing\nwith indecision which we're all subject\nto from time to time\nbasically it goes like this\ntake out a quarter heads and tails\ndefine your outcome heads i stay tails i\ngo\nnext make a binding commitment to\nyourself that no matter what you're\ngoing to follow through\non whichever outcome the coin indicates\nif it's heads i'm gonna stay no matter\nwhat if it's tails i'm gonna go no\nmatter what no exceptions\nand once you've defined the outcomes and\nmade your commitment\nall that's left is to flip the coin\nand see what happens\nnow the point of this exercise is not\nactually to do what the coin tells you\nto do\nthough it's helpful to pretend that\nthat's what's at stake\nthe point of the exercise is to notice\nhow you feel immediately after seeing\nthe result of the coin flip\nthis helps to reveal to yourself your\nown attitudes and preferences with\nrespect to the decision under\nconsideration\nit helps to confirm that deep down this\nmight be what you really want for better\nor for worse\nwhen it's not entirely clear what that\nis\nso for example\nif you look at the coin and it's a heads\nand you feel an immediate sense of\nrelief\nthat's likely the outcome that in your\nheart of hearts you really want\non the other hand\nif you look at that heads and you think\nmaybe that was just a practice throw\nthen you're likely leaning towards the\noutcome represented by the tails in this\ncase you see\nagain the point of the coin flip\ntechnique is not to do what the coin\ntells you\nbut rather to reveal your own hidden\nemotional preferences with respect to\nthe decision\nand it might be a good idea to move in\nthe direction indicated by your\nemotional response all things being\nequal try it out for yourself\nhopefully it helps to get you out of\nindecision as quickly as possible so\nthat you can move on with the rest of\nyour life\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like discussed in a future episode\nor you'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
