    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych's\nbetter living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe myth of closure\nclosure is something we all seek after\nto varying degrees in the wake of a\nsignificant relationship rupture\nand we have all of these fantasies\ntypically propagated by popular culture\nabout what closure looks like\nand it's often the case that heartbroken\nfolks looking for closure can attempt to\nrestage their own versions of these\nhollywood scenes\nusually with disastrous results as the\nother person generally hasn't read the\nsame script\ni'm sure you can picture it the former\nlovers come back together the truth is\nfinally revealed the remaining questions\nare finally answered the long sought\nafter apology is offered the loose ends\nare tied up and both parties are open\nand honest about their true feelings for\neach other and as a result the two\nformer lovers are able to move forward\non their respective paths of life\nwithout looking back\nthe issue is that this doesn't happen in\nreal life\nand this is because closure does not\ncome from another person\nif you need closure from somebody then\nwhether you like it or not you're\nputting this somebody in a position of\npower relative to you\nas you've decided that they now have the\nability to bestow or withhold a desired\ngood\nthe idea is to take that power back\nby seeking closure in ourselves\nthe fact of the matter is that we do not\nneed the other person to experience a\nfeeling of closure with respect to a\nrelationship\nthis is because closure is not when all\nthe loose ends are tied up and all the\nlingering questions are answered that\nnever happens that never\nhappens\nclosure occurs when we internally decide\nwe are ready to move on\nit's easy to say it's not always easy to\ndo\nbut that's the truth closure occurs when\nyou make the decision that you're ready\nto move on\nit's so simple\nand that's why people miss it\nthink about it\nwhat would actually happen if the former\nlover came back and told you all the\nthings that you had been waiting and\nhoping for them to say\nyou might imagine that upon hearing\ntheir apology or confession that all of\nthe confusion and pain and resentment\nthat you've been harboring for months or\nyears just disappears like some kind of\nmagic spell\nhowever that's absolutely not what\nactually happens\na much more likely response especially\nfrom someone who hasn't yet healed and\nsought closure and himself or herself is\nyou you think you can just waltz\nback into my life say i'm sorry and\nexpect to live happily ever after take\naway my pain and give me back my time\nyou see\nthat's the proof that closure doesn't\ndepend on the other person's behavior if\nit did\nthen the apology or the confession would\nimmediately resolve the inner turmoil\nand we know that it doesn't\ni suppose it's nice to hear\nhowever if we don't heal ourselves first\ntheir words probably won't change a\nthing\nhopefully that was helpful\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or you'd like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychaxpodcast gmail.com talk to you\nsoon"
