    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nget some side quests\nin case you don't know i'm a big fan of\nvideo games and of role playing games or\nrpgs in particular and i'm stealing the\nconcept of the side quest from this\nsource\nin your average rpg you have kind of\nyour main story arc in which you and\nyour fellow adventurers are trying to\nsave the world or something\nhowever along the way there are often\nhundreds of opportunities to engage in\nsmaller tasks at smaller stakes and we\ncall these side quests\ncompleting them isn't necessary to\nprogress the game but they can be a lot\nof fun and a welcome break from pure\nplot development they also generally\noffer a host of rewards both tangible\nlike money and items and intangible like\nstat increases in character development\nand finally they could simply be a means\nto a virtual trophy or a sense of\ncompletion accomplishments in their own\nright\nin my clinical practice i highly\nrecommend that my clients get some side\nquests\nthe main story arcs of your life your\ncharacter development your marriage and\nfamily take\ndecades to complete\nif you don't interrupt their development\nfrom time to time with some more\nimmediately rewarding goals\nyour life is subject to becoming a\njoyless slog with little novelty or\nvariety\nside quests spice things up and help\nensure that you receive some meaningful\nintermittent rewards along the way to\nyour ultimate destination\nso let's identify some side quests\nto do this i would encourage you to\ndifferentiate the various domains of\nyour life your personal life your health\nand fitness your friendships your\nspiritual development etc\nand then come up with some goals for\neach one of these domains and these\ngoals should have different deadlines as\nwell\nfor instance there are some goals that i\nwould like to accomplish before i die\nwhich means that i take meaningful\naction towards their completion every\nyear\non the other hand there are some goals\nthat i would like to accomplish within\nthe next 12 months which means that i\nneed to take action toward their\ncompletion every week\nthis is important because if i've\nalready enumerated all of these goals\nwhenever i have some free time on my\nhands i can just go to my menu\nperuse the list of side quests i've\naccepted and determine which would be\nthe easiest to complete given my current\nstatus\nand in this way\ni can lead a life that's rather varied\nand productive and interesting and\nrewarding and if i can do it you can do\nit so get yourself some side quests\nthey're where the fun is\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like discussed in a future episode\nor you'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
