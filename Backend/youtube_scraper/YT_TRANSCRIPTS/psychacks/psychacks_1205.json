    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nnever reject yourself\nnever reject yourself always force other\npeople to reject you this is extremely\nimportant\na lot of people miss out on all kinds of\ninteresting and rewarding opportunities\nwhether they're romantic or professional\nbecause of the lack of self-confidence\nin their ability to perform\nit is not for you to decide what is\nvaluable to somebody else\nit's not even for you to decide what\nwould be sufficient or adequate for\nsomebody else\nwhen you reject yourself you're\nbasically saying i already know what\nworks and what doesn't work for you\nand i've judged myself negatively\nrelative to those projected standards\nconsequently i'm either going to drop\nout entirely or volunteer the\ninformation that will allow you to\nevaluate me as negatively as i evaluate\nmyself\nsecretly of course the hope is that the\nother will accept me anyway\nand i will be able to secure the\nopportunity with a clean conscience and\na divestiture of responsibility\nfor instance i might have a hunch that\ni'm not exactly what an employer is\nlooking for in an employee\nmaybe i don't have exactly the\nexperience the company is looking for\nhowever if i say that in a job interview\nand i'm accepted anyway\nit's kind of the company's fault if i\ndon't perform on par with expectations\nmy conscience is clean because i didn't\nlead anybody on of course saying\nsomething along those lines in a job\ninterview is an excellent way to be\nrejected for a position\nand i could very well have been mostly\nwhat the company was looking for\nbut because of my self-rejecting\ndisclosures everyone kind of loses as a\nresult\nit's kind of like poker man\nyou see your cards\nnobody else does\nyou could be looking at your hand and\nyou have a 2-7 man i got a handful of\nnothing but if you fold your hand out of\nyour own hopelessness without anybody\ncalling or raising then you've\ncompletely eliminated the chances of a\nsuccessful outcome however slim you\nperceive such an outcome to be\nmaybe the situation will change on the\nflop\nmaybe the situation will change because\nother people will see that you've hung\non that long and they'll begin to doubt\ntheir own hands as a result like man he\nmust have something or else he would\nhave given up by now\nyou don't need to have pocket aces to\nwin a poker hand you just need a better\nhand than everybody else at showdown and\nmost hands never even get to that point\na high card can win a poker hand so you\ndon't have to optimize you don't have to\nbe the best and you certainly don't have\nto fold your own hand even if there's a\nlow chance of success very\nvery important to keep in mind\ndon't ever undercut yourself don't ever\nreject yourself\nalways force other people to expend the\nenergy to reject you\nand if that's not happening if you're\nnot being actively rejected assume that\nyou're good enough\nassume that you're good enough until you\nreceive feedback to the contrary\nthanks for listening if you have a topic\nyou'd like discussed in a future episode\nor you'd like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
