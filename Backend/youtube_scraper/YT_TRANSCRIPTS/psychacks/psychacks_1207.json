    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nmemento mori and happiness\nas you likely know memento mori is a\nlatin phrase that means reminder of\ndeath namely one's own death one's own\nmortality\nwe all know intellectually that we're\ngoing to die\nbut the vast majority of us live in a\nkind of emotional denial of that reality\notherwise how could we go about our\neveryday lives\nit would be very difficult to sustain\nthe structure of society if we weren't\nin denial with respect to the\nephemerality of our existence\nbut this isn't something that society\ndoes to us per se it's generally\nsomething that we do to ourselves\ncoming into emotional contact with our\nown mortality is kind of like staring at\nthe sun\nit's not something that we can do for\nvery long\nbut it is helpful to look at it every\nonce in a while our own mortality that\nis\nand to look at it as long and as\nsteadily as we can tolerate\nand this does two things\none\nis that when we remember that we're\nactually going to die\nin that our time on this planet is\nlimited\nwe get busy doing the things that really\nmatter\nif our time is short\nwhy bother spending it doing things that\nin your heart of hearts you don't really\nwant to do\nthat aren't furthering your growth that\naren't making you happy that are\ncreating a positive legacy in their wake\nin order to avoid pain and\ndisappointment\ni mean those things are going to happen\nanyway\nthere will be pain and disappointment in\nthe path you take to pursue your dreams\nas well as on the path you take to avoid\nthem\nso why not live in such a way that you\ncan look back and say like frankie hey i\ndid it my way\nget busy doing the things that really\nmatter so momento mori first and\nforemost helps us to prioritize that\nwhich is most important in our lives\nand the second thing it does\nis to help us let go of the small stuff\nthink about it\nif today we're the last day of our lives\ndo we really want to spend it\ncomplaining\nor regretful\nor resentful\nor heartbroken\nif it's overcast on your last day on\nthis planet don't complain about the\nlack of sun go out and play in the\npuddles\nlet go of all the needless suffering\nabout the small stuff\nmaybe today is as good as it gets\nmaybe tomorrow onward will be a slow or\nnot so slow decline into decrepitude in\noblivion\nso do you really want to spend what\ncould potentially be your last best day\nwhining and irritable\nlet's hope not\nso that's what memento mori does it\nhelps us to focus on what really matters\nand allows us to let go of all the rest\nthanks for listening\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation you can reach me\nat psychspodcast\ngmail.com\nuntil next time"
