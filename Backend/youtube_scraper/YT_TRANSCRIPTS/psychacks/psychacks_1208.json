    "video_title": "\"No\" is sufficient: how to reject an offer with confidence",
    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nno\nis sufficient\nso this is something that i encourage\npeople to keep in mind whenever they're\nin a negotiating posture relative to a\nromantic partner an employer or even a\nfriend or family member\nand there is on the table a request that\nfor whatever reason you don't want to do\nthe vast majority of folks when put in\nthe situation will attempt to identify\nseveral plausible reasons\nwhy fulfilling the request would be\nimpractical or inconvenient or unlikely\nto succeed etc\nand they base their rejection of the\nrequest on a constructed scaffold of\nreasons\nand i generally discourage folks from\ndoing that\nthe fact of the matter is that those\nreasons are almost always more like\nrationalizations how can you tell\nwell if you really wanted to accept the\nrequest then you would likely do so in\nspite of the difficulties involved\nso\nthey're not\nthey're really not the reasons why you\ndon't want to do something\nthe reason why you don't want to do\nsomething in the vast majority of cases\nis that you don't want to do it\nand my argument is that that's\nsufficient\nyou're not wanting to do something is\nsufficient grounds for not doing that\nsomething\nyou're wanting to do something is\nsufficient grounds for doing that\nsomething\nthe more we come up with reasons why we\neither do or do not want to do something\nthe more we inadvertently devalue the\ncurrency of our own wills and desires\non some level we're communicating that\neven we don't believe it's enough that\nwe don't want to do something\nthat our reasons are more valid than our\ndesires\nand this is how people over time can\ncome to undermine the legitimacy of\ntheir own experience\noverall i think it's better to see our\nagencies in our wills\nthan it is to make our agencies\ncontingent on more circumstantial\nfactors\nand this is important to consider with\nrespect to negotiation as well because\nif you reject an offer and you provide a\nbunch of reasons why you're turning it\ndown well that actually leaves the door\nopen for counter offers in future\ndiscussions\nbecause if the other person is taking\nyour rejection at face value they think\nokay this person has an issue with x y\nand z which means that if i address\nissues x y and z then the basis of the\nrejection disappears and i can expect to\ntransform this rejection into an\nacceptance when the fact of the matter\nis that if you really don't want to do\nsomething it won't really matter whether\nthat person addresses issues x y and z\nyou're still not going to want to do it\nthe danger here is that the other person\nwill take the time to address your\nstated concerns which kind of puts you\nbetween a rock and a hard place\neither you're gonna have to admit that\nthose really weren't the reasons for\nyour rejection or to create even more\nreasons for your continued rejection\nor you're gonna go along with something\nyou really don't want to go along with\nin order to save face\nmost likely you'll reject the amended\noffer anyway and then everyone's going\nto kind of feel a little resentful\nbecause their time was wasted\nit's much better to just say that you\ndon't want to do it from the outset why\nbecause i don't really want to do it\nthat's the end of the conversation\nyour no is sufficient\nso that's what i have to say on the\nmatter if you have a topic you'd like to\nhave discussed in a future episode or\nwould like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach me at psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com until next time"
