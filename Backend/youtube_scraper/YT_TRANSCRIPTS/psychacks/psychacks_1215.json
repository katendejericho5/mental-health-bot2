    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis money is incentivized altruism\nnow freud once said the whole point of\npsychotherapy\nis to enable people to love and to work\nthose two things he believed are the\nfoundation of a successful adult life on\nthis planet the ability to love\nand the ability to work and in my own\nclinical experience\nit's the fact that people generally\nreach out to me when they're\nexperiencing difficulties\nin one or the other domain on the one\nhand\nissues attracting quality partners or\nmaintaining satisfying relationships\non the other hand career dissatisfaction\nand financial concerns\nso i actually talk about money a lot\nwith my clients as i think it's often\nvery clinically relevant\nand in the scope of my practice i have\nencountered some individuals\nthey're generally young people in their\n20s who have very negative beliefs about\nmoney\nthings like money is the root of all\nevil money corrupts people\nmoney turns people into slaves and that\nthe world would just be a better place\nwithout it\nand in my opinion money is inherently\nnone of those things\ninherently money is sort of neutral it's\npotential\nand certainly that potential has been\nand continues to be used in\ninappropriate ways\nhowever in the vast vast majority of\ncases\nmoney is used very very constructively\nmoney is functionally used to\nincentivize\naltruism if you look at the world\nand the billions of people going about\ntheir jobs\npeople picking up your garbage and\nmaking your clothes and growing your\nfood and building your furniture and\nhealing your wounds and teaching your\nchildren and producing your leisure\nall of these jobs are focused on\nproviding a service to\nother people often people that they\ndon't even know\nnow if we were to take the money out of\nthe equation\nwe would call these people saints in\ntheir devotion to serving others\nbut because they're getting paid for\ntheir work we generally think they're\njust doing their job or they're just\ndoing it for money\nbut money is just a piece of paper or\nincreasingly some ones and zeros it has\nlittle to no inherent value\nmoney is a socially fabricated fiction\nthat we all collectively choose to\nbelieve in because it generally\nmotivates pro-social behavior\nit's such a cunning trick of the mind\ntell folks they're working for something\ncalled money\nand they spend all day helping other\npeople\nnow i don't know about you but on my day\noff in my spare time\ni'm not volunteering at the local\norphanage i'm not building\nhouses for the homeless i'm typically\nnot helping other people at all\ni don't know about you but if you're\nlike me i generally devote that time to\nmy own self-interest and pleasure\nand i believe that's how most people\nalso choose to spend their free time\nor how they would choose to spend all\ntheir time if they were liberated from\nthe quote necessity\nof earning money it's not like most\npeople would naturally just\ngo around helping other people out and\nthe few who chose to\nwould not be able to help other people\nout at anywhere close to the same scale\nthat most of us currently enjoy in\nmodern civilization\nyou hear what i'm saying so without\nmoney\nthat fiction that incentivizes altruism\nthe whole system which has now become a\nglobal network with\nbillions of interconnections falls apart\nthe vast majority of the global economy\nis based on helping other people\neither by providing them with a needed\nservice or by offering them a product\nthat solves one of their problems\nsomeone i don't know someone i probably\nwon't ever know\ngrew my food and made my clothes and\nbuilt my house\nand that's actually kind of a beautiful\nthing\npeople helping others without even\nnoticing who's benefiting from their\nactions\nif you can see money as the fiction that\nit is\nthen suddenly the world becomes a vast\nnetwork of people helping people\nand the only way this could ever happen\nwithout money on this planet\nis through the threat of force either\ndirect violence\nor indirect ostracization and that's\nwhat we see occurs in communist\nsocieties\nthe fact the matter is people just\naren't that motivated to be pro-social\nand altruistic\nof their free and spontaneous will need\nproof\njust look at your own behavior how do\nyou spend your free time\nyou're probably not out there serving\nother people so there needs to be some\nsort of motivating factor\nthe carrot or the stick as for me\ni much prefer the carrot so money can be\nconsidered a\nsocial good because it creates the\nfiction\nthat incentivizes altruism\nso those are my thoughts for what\nthey're worth if you have a topic you'd\nlike discussed in a future episode or\nwould like to schedule a consultation\nplease reach out to psychaxpodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
