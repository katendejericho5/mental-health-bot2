    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\novercoming emotional manipulation\nso i have a slightly controversial\nperspective on this subject\nwhich is that it's not actually possible\nto emotionally manipulate\nanother person however what is subject\nto occurring\nis that we end up emotionally\nmanipulating ourselves\nso let me explain the way that this\nself-manipulation\ngenerally works is that another person\nsucceeds\nin saying something or doing something\nthat provokes a distressing negative\nemotion inside of us\nand we all have emotions that are just\nway more difficult to deal with than\nothers for some people it's guilt\nfor other people it's fear for another\ngroup it's envy or jealousy\nwhatever the emotion is this other\nperson has succeeded in triggering the\nemotion inside of us\nand what seems to happen within the\nsubjectivity\nof that emotional response is that we\nnow have no choice\nbut to agree to something that we\nwouldn't otherwise do\nin order to appease the apparent source\nof the emotional distress\nwhich we see as the other person\nhowever the fact of the matter is that\nthat person's words or actions\ndidn't actually cause that negative\nemotional response inside of you\nif they did they would pretty much cause\nthe same negative emotional response in\nothers which we can fairly safely assume\nisn't universally the case it's more\naccurate to say\nthat the other person's words or actions\nwere stimuli\nfor certain judgments associations or\nmemories within your own mind\nand that your emotional response is a\nreaction\nto these inner psychological events or\nto put it another way\nno one can actually make you feel a\ncertain way without your being complicit\nto a certain extent in the decision your\nfeelings are your responsibility\nokay so accepting that is true now that\ni'm\nholding this negative emotion the trick\nto withstanding the bid to appease the\napparent source\nis to increase your capacity to tolerate\nthat specific negative emotion and this\nbasically means your ability to feel\nsomething to feel that despair to feel\nthat terror to feel that rage\nwithout doing anything about it to think\nit's gonna be okay this isn't what i\nwould prefer to feel right now\nbut the feeling isn't going to kill me\nand i can withstand its pressure\nwithout necessarily taking action in\nfact\nthe feeling is probably going to go away\nall by itself in 15 or 20 minutes\nif i don't do anything so all i need to\ndo\nis get through the next quarter hour\nwithout making a decision\nthat will make my situation much much\nworse in the long run\ni don't need to appease the apparent\nmanipulator\njust to escape this distressing emotion\na few minutes earlier than i otherwise\nwould\ni'm going to tolerate this emotion i can\nwatch it fluoresce\ncrescendo and diminish over time\nand i can come out on the other end of\nthat emotional experience without having\ncompromised my values or sacrificed my\nagenda\nso the trick to dealing with emotional\nmanipulation is on the one hand\nbecoming increasingly aware of the ways\nin which we trigger\nourselves and taking responsibility for\nour emotional responses\nand on the other hand increasing our\ncapacity to tolerate those negative\nemotions\nonce they do appear whatever you're\nfeeling it will\nchange over time and you don't\nnecessarily have to do\nanything to speed up that process thanks\nfor listening\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation\nplease reach out to psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
