    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis rule out the confounds rule out the\nconfounds\nso this is something that is extremely\nuseful to do\nbefore seeking out professional help\nand yet i see folks not doing this all\nthe time\nin my clinical practice basically it\nmeans\nhave you already attempted to exclude\nall\nother plausible contributors to your\ncurrent problem\nbefore seeking the assistance of a\nprofessional\nit sounds simple but you'd be surprised\nhow often folks\ndon't go through this process before\nengaging my services\nso for example a person might come to me\ncomplaining of high levels of anxiety or\neven a history of panic attacks\nand in the course of treatment it comes\nout that he's drinking\nsix or seven units of alcohol on a\nnightly basis now\nif you don't know this alcohol is a\nneurodepressant it inhibits\nthe sympathetic nervous system and in\nits attempts to restore homeostasis\nthis stimulates the sympathetic nervous\nsystem to work more intensely\nto counteract the effects of the\nsubstance so that when the alcohol\nintoxication eventually wears off the\nsympathetic nervous system no longer has\nan inhibitor to push against and it now\nfeels like it's kicked into overdrive\nand in many respects\nthe felt experience of the elevated\nsympathetic response\nis functionally indistinguishable from\nanxiety\nand so now the question is complicated\nis this person legitimately dealing with\nan anxiety disorder or is he\nexperiencing\nthe withdrawal syndrome of acute alcohol\nwith\nwithdrawal and until the individual\nmakes an attempt to abstain from alcohol\nfor a while there's really no way to\nresolve the ambiguity satisfactorily\nand it's hard to create an effective\nintervention or treatment plan\nif the actual problem hasn't yet been\nreliably identified\nand this is something that a person in\nmost cases\ncould have done on his own before\ncontracting with a therapist\nas hard as it is let's try to go two\nweeks without drinking and observe its\neffect\non anxiety best case scenario hey\ni'm not getting as anxious maybe i need\nto focus on restricting my alcohol\nintake\nas opposed to seeking help for panic\nattacks and on the other hand\nif that person were to stop drinking for\ntwo weeks only to find no\nchange in his anxiety levels then that\nwould be useful information for the\ntherapist he may\nsubsequently choose to engage to treat\nthe anxiety i mean\nany decent therapist will conduct a drug\nand alcohol history\nfairly early in the course of treatment\nespecially if someone presents with\nsymptoms of an anxiety disorder or\na mood disorder in general then the\nindividual can say to the professional\nhey\ni tried this this and this didn't\nactually solve the problem\nwhat else you got this will help make\nthat session\nway more useful effectively giving you\nmore bang for your buck\nand increasing the likelihood that\nyou're both on the right track\nso if possible rule out your confounds\nbefore\nseeking out professional help so that's\nwhat i've got to say\nif you have a topic you would like\ndiscussed in a future episode or would\nlike to set up a consultation\nyou can contact me at sitecax podcast\ngmail.com talk to you soon"
