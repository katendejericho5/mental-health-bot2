    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis this is it\nso this is something that often comes up\nwhen i'm speaking to folks in their 20s\ngenerally older populations don't\nexperience this issue to the same degree\nbasically it's the feeling that i'm\nmissing out\ni'm wasting my time that i'm not doing\nenough\nor that i'm here and life is somehow\nsomewhere else\nand though this can be a bit of a let\ndown\ni generally ask these folks to consider\nthe possibility\nthat there might not be anything else\nout there that they're missing out on\nmaybe this is it maybe this\nis life and they have just as much life\nnow wherever they happen to be whatever\nthey happen to be doing\nas they would have in some other time\nand place that the fabric of life here\nat an essential level\nis functionally identical to the fabric\nof life where they imagine they\nneed to be life just is what it is\nyou're not missing something the life\nyou're currently living\nis just as full and complete in terms of\nits existential attributes\nas it would be in a mansion or in a\ncommitted relationship or with a\nmaster's degree or while touring around\nthe country in a sprinter van\netcetera i think this\nillusion that there is something more to\nlife\narises out of the modern experience of\nchildhood and adolescence\nin our society young people are put into\na really\nstructured linear progression from\nelementary school\nto middle school from middle school to\nhigh school from high school to college\nfrom college to first\njob and those first few years in a\ncareer are also generally characterized\nby\na rapid succession of promotions and\nincreases\nso as a result of the experiences of the\nfirst 25 years of life\na lot of folks enter into their\nadulthood proper with the expectation\nthat life is just this gradual but\ninevitable upward trajectory a line\nwhose slope is just always up and to the\nright\nhowever at around 25 the\npromotions start to arrive less\nfrequently and there is no clearly\ndefined linear track\nand folks are just doing life\nyou're in the role functioning adult\nthat the linear progression prepared you\nfor\ngoing to work buying groceries going to\nbed at a reasonable time\ntrying to find time to exercise rinse\nwash repeat\nand what about the next milestones\ngetting married and having children\nand beyond that retirement three steps\nover 40 years so the progression really\nbegins to plateau around this time\nand they think often erroneously that\nthey're doing something wrong or that\nthey're missing out in some capacity\nbecause their life\nisn't accelerating like it used to well\non some level\nthat linear growth was somehow\nartificial and arbitrary\nand this is well this is life\nand of course life has other plans for\nus life has victories and pleasures in\nstore\nyes but it also has sickness and loss\nand heartbreak and difficulty and\nunkindness\nthat's part of the fabric of life it\ndoesn't always look like how we imagined\nit would be\nand part of growing up is kind of\naccepting\nthe inevitable disappointments of\nreality\nbut just as a silver lining once you\narrive at that place of acceptance\nthat it is what it is you're also\nliberated from this self-imposed\npressure that you have to do something\nthat your life is already complete and\nfull\nand on some level all of your efforts\none way or the other\nwouldn't change that fact one bit\nthere's no need to\ndo you can just be\nyou can just live your life without the\npressure or compulsion of action\nand this is actually extremely peaceful\nit is an immense emancipation to arrive\nat that place\nbut to do so you have to pass through\nthis gate of disappointment to get there\nso those are my thoughts on the matter\nhope they were helpful if you have a\ntopic you'd like discussed in a future\nepisode would like to set up a\nconsultation\nyou can contact me at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\nthanks for listening"
