    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis should and anger\ngenerally behind most angry emotions\nis a thought that contains the concept\nof should\nsomething like i shouldn't have to deal\nwith this or\nthis person should have known better and\nthese thoughts\ncan be very dangerous it's not really\npossible to think these thoughts give\nthem attention\nvalidate them with belief and not feel\nangry\nso i'd like you to consider that\nthoughts like these are really\nanger pathogens they're what create\nanger\nthe i the issue is that when people use\nthe concept of\nshould in this way they're really using\nit incorrectly\nand that incorrect usage is what\ncontributes to the emotional suffering\nthe incorrect use of the word should is\nanything\nthat suggests that reality has a moral\nor ethical\nobligation to be anything other than\nwhat it actually is\nthat it has a moral or ethical\nobligation to be aligned with what\nthey believe reality should be thinking\nin this manner is just\nasking to be outraged there is also\nreally no basis for such beliefs\ni mean where is it written that reality\nmust align with our own hopes and\ndesires\nhowever virtuous and noble those hopes\nand desires might be\nthat's not really how things work on\nthis planet\nalternatively a better use of the word\nshould\nis as a kind of shorthand for given the\nconfluence of factors that are exerting\nthemselves on a given situation\nthe most likely outcome is so that's a\nbit of a mouthful so i'll say it again\na better use of the word should is as a\nkind of\nshorthand for given the confluence of\nfactors that are exerting themselves\non a given situation the most likely\noutcome is\nso for example if i were to go up to the\nroof of my house\nand i were to drop a glass bottle from\nthat height it should break when it hits\nthe ground\nthat is due to the force generated by\nthe rapid deceleration when the bottle\ncomes into contact with the ground and\nthe structural integrity of the bonds\nbetween the molecules comprising the\nglass and several other factors\nthe most likely outcome is that the\nbottle breaks as a result of that\ncollision\nif it breaks it should have broken\nif for some reason it doesn't break it\nshouldn't have broken\nbecause apparently the forces exerted on\nthat bottle were not sufficient to cause\nthat to happen\neverything is as it should be\nso you'll notice instead of starting\nwith our ideals\nand trying to impose them on reality and\ngetting angry when there's a lack of\nalignment between how things are and how\nwe want them to be\nwe start with reality and allow reality\nto dictate our models of\nand beliefs about the way things should\nbe this attitude is actually very\nscientific rather than attempting to\nforce reality into a pre-existing\nframework\nwe can functionally go to reality and\nsay teach me\nhelp me understand why this happened the\nway that it did\nthrough an examination of the forces\nthat conspired to create this outcome\nas surprising or personally distasteful\nthis outcome happens to be for me teach\nme\nand if i were to continue to stubbornly\ninsist\nthat this shouldn't have happened or\npeople should behave in a certain way\nthen i'm turning a willfully blind eye\nto the reasons why reality is the way\nthat it is\nwhich actually robs me of the\nopportunity to grow into greater\nalignment with those forces for my own\nbetterment\nthe more i listen to reality the more i\ncan build\naccurate representations of reality with\nmy words and beliefs\nwhich in turn will help me stay safe and\nget what i want\nmoving forward hopefully that was\nhelpful\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation\nplease reach out at psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\nwe'll talk more in future episodes"
