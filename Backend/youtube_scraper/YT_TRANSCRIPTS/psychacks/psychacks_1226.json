    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis the captain can't complain\nso this is something to keep in mind\nwhenever you find yourself in a position\nof leadership you can only complain\nup so on a ship the sailors are\ncomplaining to the deck officers\nand the deck officers are complaining to\nthe first mate and the first meme is\ncomplaining to the captain\nand that's where the buck stops the\ncaptain can't complain\nit's one of the duties that accompany\nthe privilege\nof occupying a position of power because\nimagine what happens if this obligation\nwere violated\nlet's say the first mate comes into the\ncaptain's quarters one night and asks\nhey cap how you doing\nand the captain responds oh man i don't\nknow i'm not so good\ni'm really anxious i can see that we're\nabout to enter into a\ndangerous section of the ocean i mean\nlots of shoals just beneath the surface\nand and there's definitely could be some\nthat don't even appear on the map\nand if that's not bad enough i'm getting\nsome attitude from the sailors and\nand i'm not sure if they're going to\nfollow my orders when necessary i mean\nsome of them\neven complain about me behind their back\nand that doesn't really\nmatter since we could all just end up\ndrowning in our sleep anyway\nso thanks for asking have a good night\nthe first mate is going to leave\nand think holy we're completely\nwe've either got to stage a mutiny or\nfind a way to get off this boat while we\nstill have our lives\nthe reason why the captain can't\ncomplain\nis that there are others who are\ndependent upon him within a given\nhierarchy of power\nand when you perturb those who are\ndependent upon you\nyou shake the very foundation of their\ncontingent positions\ndependency naturally creates awareness\nof vulnerability\nand this vulnerability must be respected\nby those in positions of power\non some level we need our leaders\nto exhibit confidence in their ability\nand firmness\nin their direction in order to willingly\nfollow them through the dangerous shoals\nof life\nnow does this mean that captains can\nnever be perturbed\nthey can never be afraid they can never\nbe uncertain\nof course not just talk to other\ncaptains about it\nget a captain support group buddy or if\nyou're back on land\ngo and complain to your admiral but\nwithout exception\nif you're occupying a position of power\nyou cannot complain downward this is\ntrue at work\nin your romantic relationships in your\nfamily whoever has more power\nalso has the responsibility to protect\nthose with less\nfrom unnecessary anxiety so that's what\ni have to say for today\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode or would like to\nschedule a consultation\nplease reach out to psych hackspodcast\ngmail.com\nwe'll talk more in future episodes"
