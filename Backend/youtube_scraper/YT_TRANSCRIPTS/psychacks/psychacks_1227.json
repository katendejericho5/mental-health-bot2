    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psychex\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis how to confront a friend\nthis is actually very very difficult to\ndo\nthe reason is that when we're in close\nrelationships with friends and loved\nones\nwe often depend on that relationship\nboth emotionally\nand instrumentally in a lot of different\nways and when a loved one begins to\nmanifest\nproblematic behavior one that is\ncorroding the quality of that\nrelationship\nwe can feel reluctant to confront the\nother out of\nfear of losing the relationship so\nsometimes we end up\nenabling behaviors out of a desire not\nto lose a relationship\nthat is let's say mostly good but is\nbecoming increasingly problematic\nthat said i think it's important to call\npeople out on their behavior\nespecially if those behaviors left\nunchecked\nwould naturally bring about the\ndegradation of the relationship\nall by themselves so let's take a simple\nexample like\nflakiness flakiness is one of my\npersonal pet peeves i hate it\nand throughout the years some of my\nfriends and acquaintances have\ndemonstrated flaky behavior\none way i've learned to deal with this\nis by calling them out on this behavior\nearly on in the process by revealing\nwhat the impact of their flakiness\nis on my willingness to continue the\nrelationship\nand this is especially powerful if this\nimpact\nis kind of an organic natural emotional\nresponse\nso for instance a friend makes plans\nwith me\nand at the last moment he flakes so i'll\ncall him up and say something like hey\nman\ni've noticed that you've been flaky the\nlast couple times we've made plans\nand i just want you to know that your\nflakiness makes me more reluctant to\nmake plans with you which\nsidebar is the natural human emotional\nresponse\nwhen people consistently cancel plans\nyou come to not trust\nthat they're going to follow through and\nso you kind of organically begin to pull\nback\nand this of course isn't news to anyone\nit's likely exactly how the flaky person\nfeels\nwhen someone consistently cancels plans\non him\nso you just share with them how their\nbehavior makes you feel you don't come\ndown heavy saying things like people\nshould keep their word or\nyou need to get your act together\ninstead just say something like the\nnatural consequence of you doing this\nis that i don't really want to make\nplans with you moving forward\nand that's concerning to me because i\nlike our relationship i value\nour friendship and i'd like us to\ncontinue but i've noticed that i'm kind\nof starting to pull back and withdraw\nfrom you\nas i'm often left with the fuzzy end of\nthe lollipop is this something you're\nopen to changing\nat this point if you succeeded in\nconfronting your friend with i\nstatements\ntalking about your own subjective\nexperience non-judgmentally\ninstead of coming down with a lot of\nblame and shame most people\nare going to be like yeah you're right\nokay my bad i'll try harder\nand then you can see if their behavior\nactually changes moving forward because\npeople can say whatever they want in\nthat moment the real apology has changed\nbehavior\nand that's kind of how you go about the\nbusiness of confronting a friend you\nspeak about the natural\nemotional effect the behavior has on you\nand you confess that it's compromising\nyour ability to participate\nauthentically in the relationship okay\ni hope that's helpful if you have a\ntopic you'd like discussed in a future\nepisode or would like to schedule\na consultation please reach out to psych\nhacks podcast\ngmail.com we'll talk more in future\nepisodes"
