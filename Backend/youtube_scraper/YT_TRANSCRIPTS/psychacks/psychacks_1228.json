    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban\nand this is psych hacks better living\nthrough psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nfear\nof disappointment this is something that\ni encounter\nfairly frequently in my clinical\npractice people who are\noverly concerned about disappointing\nothers\nthese are generally folks who by their\nown admission are people pleasers\nso more agreeable versus disagreeable\npersonality types\nand in these cases the fear of\ndisappointing others can be\nso paralyzing that it can lead the\nsyndromes of chronic worrying or even\npanic attacks\nof course the fear of disappointing\nothers is bound up with abandonment\nconcerns\nthat is if i were to estrange this\nperson's feelings if they were to not\nlike me anymore they would simply\nleave me to my own devices okay so\nlisten there is justified disappointment\nand unjustified disappointment justified\ndisappointment\noccurs when a mutually agreed upon\ncommitment\nis unilaterally violated by one of the\nparties involved\nso for example if you were to make a\nplan to meet your friend at the pub down\nthe street tomorrow night at 8 pm\nand at 7 45 your buddy calls you up and\nsays oh\nman dude i'm so sorry i can't make it\ntonight\nthat is justifiable disappointment maybe\nthe guy is a good reason\nmaybe he doesn't but the fact is that\nthere was a mutually agreed upon\ncommitment\nthat was unilaterally violated so your\ndisappointment in this case may be\njustified\nyou came to expect that a certain thing\nwould happen\nat a certain time and now that\nexpectation has been betrayed\nhowever if there is no mutually agreed\nupon commitment\nif there's just a personal preference or\nstandard\nor an expectation that hasn't been\nverbalized and that exists only in your\nmind or someone else's mind\nthen any violation of that expectation\nwould create an\nunjustified disappointment not\nmeeting the unexpressed expectation of\nanother\nisn't your problem that's their problem\nand their disappointment is their\nresponsibility\nfor choosing to expect compliance with\nan unexpressed commitment\ndisappointment in this case is like\ntrying to enforce\na non-consensual contract since\nat least one of the parties involved\nwasn't aware of the terms of the\nagreement\nthis definitely wouldn't hold up in a\ncourt of law\njust to further demonstrate how\nridiculous this notion is\nimagine coming into work on monday\nmorning and running into your boss\nwho says something like you know i was\nreally disappointed to see that the\njohnson report\nwasn't waiting for me on my desk when i\narrived and you said\nwhat are you talking about i've never\nheard of the johnson report and your\nboss said\nwell that's no excuse a good employee\nwould have taken the initiative\nto see if there were any reports i\nwanted to compile you should have known\ni mean in this case you'd have an\nactionable complaint with hr\nrather a reasonable person would respond\nwith something like\nyou mean we actually haven't discussed\nthe johnson account\noh well it makes sense that you wouldn't\nhave compiled the report that you\ndidn't know existed i'm sorry so\nwhat you need to do is da da da da da\nthat's how a mature person would respond\nto learning\nthat one of his or her unexpressed\nexpectations has been violated\nnot with anger and blaming but with\nunderstanding and apology\nso don't worry about disappointing\nothers it's really nothing to be scared\nof\ninstead focus on fulfilling your own\ncommitments\nas this is the only way you could\njustifiably disappoint another person\nand this fulfillment generally lies\nsquarely within the domain of control\nanyway\nso that's what i have to say if you have\na topic you'd like discussed in a future\nepisode or would like to schedule a\nconsultation\nplease reach out to psych hacks podcast\ngmail.com\ntalk to you soon"
