    "transcript": "it's actually very very difficult to\ntell what a woman's bedroom Persona will\nbe until you get her in the bedroom even\nthrough careful observation of her\npublic facing Persona it will be\ndifficult to predict what she's going to\nbe like behind closed doors there are\ngirls who seem to be squeaky clean on\nthe outside like they seem conventional\ninnocent even pure nice girls but who\nare the nastiest freakiest girls\nimaginable when the curtains have been\ndrawn by the same token there are some\nwomen who looked toally wild they're all\ntatted up with provocative clothing and\nedgy attitudes but who are fairly timid\nand conservative when you get them in\nthe bedroom the upshot is that the\npublic facing Persona rarely affords\ngood consistent information with respect\nto the bedroom Persona and women I think\noften don't adequately appreciate how\ndifficult it is for most men to navigate\nthis dichotomy For Better or Worse we\ntend to think that how she is out in\npublic is more or less how she is going\nto be in the bedroom"
