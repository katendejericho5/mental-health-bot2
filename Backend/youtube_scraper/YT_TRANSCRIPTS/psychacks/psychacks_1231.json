    "transcript": "i'm dr orion tarabin and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis don't play dress-up\nnow this is something that i see a lot\nof younger men do with respect to\nimportant decisions in their lives\nwho to get into romantic relationships\nwith what city in the world to live in\nwhat career path to take they don't\nreally have a clear idea of what they\nwant and so they engage in a kind of\nfantasy narrative\nthat i call playing dress-up so\nfor example a guy might not know exactly\nwhat he wants\nin a romantic relationship it'll meet a\nwoman and he'll find a little bit more\nabout her\nand discover okay she's one of those\nhigh-powered\ncorporate types and he'll think to\nhimself\nokay that that's not really my life but\nbut i can make it work\nyeah she'll be out working late and so\ni'll do the chores and have dinner on\nthe table when she comes home and\nand we'll go to holiday parties and\nswanky bars with with\npadded leather booths and we'd fly first\nclass to europe for a\nholiday once a year and we'll hire nanny\nto take care of the kids\nit'll be great we'll be like a power\ncouple slaying it in the business world\nyeah that'll be our thing or he'll meet\nanother woman\nand learn that well she's a country girl\nat heart\nshe likes horses and knows how to shoot\na gun and he'll be like\nokay i've i've never lived in the\ncountry but i'm willing to try it out\nyeah i could learn how to fire a gun and\nbail hay i'll\ni'll ride a horse buy a hat we'll have a\nbunch of\nhonest apple cheeked children who'll\nhelp me chop the firewood yeah\ni can make it work that's playing\ndress-up\nand these relationships are almost\nalways doomed to failure because they're\nnot really grounded in reality\nthey're not really grounded in a firm\nsense of what a person wants\nand that's because a firm sense in what\na person wants\nis always based on accurate\nself-knowledge\nat a certain point in life you kind of\nhave to understand\nand accept who you are not who you think\nyou are\nnot who you could be not who you want to\nbe\nbut who you actually are\nwhat you like what you don't like what\nworks for you\nwhat doesn't work for you and out of\nthat understanding\nwill come authentic preferences values\nand priorities and when you have this\nexplicit understanding\nyou can evaluate opportunities that you\nencounter on your\npath to the extent that they align with\nyour own criteria\nabout what you want so rather than\ntrying to fit yourself\ninto each opportunity that presents\nitself you\nbegin to evaluate the likely match\nbetween the presented opportunity and\nyour own desires\nwhen a new relationship or career\nprospect presents itself\nyou assess it through the lens of what\nyou're looking for\nand if it meets enough of your criteria\nyou say great let's go for it this seems\nlike it could work\nand if it doesn't you say yeah thanks\nbeen no thanks\nand in this way you enter into\nrelationships and careers\nthat have goodness of fit and these\nrequire\nso much less effort to initiate\nmaintain and flourish so those are my\nthoughts on the matter\nif you have a topic you'd like discussed\nin a future episode\nor would like to schedule a consultation\nyou can reach out at\npsych hackspodcast gmail.com or leave a\nmessage in the comments below\nplease like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
