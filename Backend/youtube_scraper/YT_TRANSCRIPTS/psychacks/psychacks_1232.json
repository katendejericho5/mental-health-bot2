    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology the\nsubject of today's short talk is\nfollow the function okay i'm kind of\nstealing this from\num investigators police investigators\nwho often say okay you want to know who\nthe culprit is\nfollow the money who stands to benefit\nas a result of this crime\nso if you want to potentially look at\nyour life and you see certain habits or\ncertain behaviors\nthat on the surface seem to cause a lot\nof harm or distress or difficulty for\nyou but\nyou still have trouble getting rid of or\nchanging to a more\nadaptive version follow the function\nwhat is this behavior\ndoing in the context of your life it has\nto serve a function or else it still\nwouldn't be there\neven if it's dysfunctional remember most\nof the word dysfunction\nis the word function most of what is\ndysfunctional\nis functional it just creates additional\nproblems\non top of the problem that it's been\ndesigned to solve\nso in the vast majority of cases\nmaladaptive habits vices behaviors\nthey serve a function that in the mind\nof the individual\nis a net positive so for example\ni often work with people who are chronic\nworriers\nthey worry about things all the time\nhundreds of times a day they know\nrationally that most of the things\nthey're concerned about will never\nhappen and yet they sort of feel\npowerless\nto to block this compulsion\nand they often resist efforts to\nintervene and address the issue\nand this has to do with the function\nthat that behavior is serving in that\nperson's life\nwhich is within their own subjective\nexperience they believe\nat a deeper level that the worrying\nbehavior keeps them\nsafe that if they weren't worrying about\nthings in the future\nthey would be even more exposed and\nvulnerable than they already are\nso even though they understand that the\nworrying corrodes their quality of life\nthey believe you know as a sum total\nthat behavior to be a net positive\nbecause the preventative or safety be\num associations with respect to that\nbehavior\noutweigh the negative deleterious\naspects of that behavior\nso they keep it because it's a net\npositive and that's true for pretty much\nany quote unquote dysfunctional behavior\nthat you have in your life\nis it's still around because on some\nlevel you believe it to be a net\npositive\nthat it's preferable to giving it up\nwhich might expose you to more distress\nor more harm\ndo you see what i'm saying so that means\nto address for example the issue of\nchronic worry you have to find some\nother more adaptive behavior\nthat still meets that function i.e the\nfunction of reducing my feeling of\nvulnerability\nor the function of increasing my feeling\nof safety\nin my life both of which are important\nneeds the issue is that\nthis behavior meets those needs while\ncreating a lot of\nother problems in the in the meantime so\nif you're having difficulty\nunderstanding why\nsomething persists in your life despite\nit causing you pain or distress\nfollow the function what is it doing in\nyour life how\nis it on some level a net positive\nwithin your own\nsubjective understanding that's what i\ngot for you today please like and\nsubscribe\nwe'll talk more in the future"
