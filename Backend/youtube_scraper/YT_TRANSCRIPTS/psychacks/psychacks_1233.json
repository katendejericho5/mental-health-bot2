    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychax\nbetter living through psychology\nand the subject of today's short talk is\nhow over\nwhat what does this mean so a little\nwhile back i posted a video that was\ncalled everyone is\ncompletely unique and totally\nreplaceable and that's\nthe paradox of human interpersonal\nrelationships\nbut let's dive a little bit deeper into\nthis idea what\naspect of our relationships is the\nunique part and what aspect of our\nrelationships is the replaceable part\nand i think it breaks down pretty cl\nevenly\ncleanly along the concepts of how versus\nwhat\nso in our relationships there's always a\nwhat\ncomponent like what's the function that\nwe perform\nwithin this role in the relationship\nprofessionally it could be i'm here to\noversee this team of 10 people\ni compile according to reports i perform\nthe financial analysis\net cetera you know romantic\nrelationships it could be i provide\nemotional support\ni provide sexual intimacy i provide\ninstrumental support and counsel\netc the thing is is that the\nwhat that we bring to a relationship is\nactually the replaceable aspect of that\nrelationship\ndo you think you're the only person to\ncompile a quarterly report\nno way there are millions of people who\ncould probably do that\nyou think you're the only person to\nprovide sex and intimacy get out of here\nthere's\nliterally billions of people that could\nperform that role\nso we need to not ignore the what\nbecause that's basically how we earn the\nprivilege of remaining\nin that role in that relationship by\ndischarging the what the function\nof that role but if we if we prioritize\nthat\nand neglect the other components we\nleave ourselves vulnerable\nto being more easily replaced when it\nbecomes convenient or expedient for\nsomeone else to do so so what's the\nunique aspect the unique aspect is the\nhow\nyeah you might compile quarterly reports\nbut if you bring your own\nunique perspective or insight or flare\nor\nelocution to that report that's\nsomething that they're not going to be\nable to find anywhere else\nyes you can have sex and intimacy with\nlots of other people\nbut what's the quality the emotional\nquality of that experience\nthat might be something that is very\nunique and\nspecial to that dynamic of people\nso if you want to maintain a\nrelationship\nnot only do you have to discharge the\nthe what\nbut you have to prioritize increasingly\nthe how\num what is your attitudes your\nvalues your perspectives your insights\nyour\nyour vibe for lack of a better word that\nyou're bringing to a relationship\nbecause the more that they\nyou give people the opportunity to feel\nthat and to experience that\nthe more likely they're going to\nassociate you with something\num that especially if they if they\nresonate with it with something that\nthey need to keep in their lives\nand they're going to focus more and more\non on that vibe as opposed to the\nfunctions\nthat you are um let's say discharging as\na matter of course\nso that's my thoughts on the matter\nplease like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
