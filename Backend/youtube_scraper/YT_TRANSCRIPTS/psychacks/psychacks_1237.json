    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis and is expensive\nthe concept of and drives\ncost what do i mean by this very simple\nexample you go into your local cafe\nyou say i'd like a cup of coffee please\nthey said that's three dollars and\nyou're like wait a minute\nwell what if i want a cup of coffee and\ni want some steamed milk\ninside of it they say oh that's a latte\nokay well that's going to be four\ndollars well wait a minute\nwhat if i want a cup of coffee and\nthere's steamed milk\nand there's some sort of caramel flavor\noh well that's going to be a\ncaramel frappe whatever that's 450. you\nget what i'm saying\nevery time you say and\nthere's going to be a greater cost\nassociated with\ngetting more of what you want now this\nisn't necessarily an\nissue so long as you're prepared to pay\nmore\nevery time you say the word and this is\na very obvious example when it comes to\ncafes but think about it both your\npersonal and your professional life\nsometimes i coach folks who are trying\nto level up their careers or take a new\ntrajectory\nprofessionally and they think okay well\ni want\na high paying job and i want to be my\nown boss and i want to work with whoever\ni want to work with and i want to do it\neverywhere in the world\nand i don't want to have to go back to\nschool and it's like well\nit's going to be very you can get all\nthose things\nbut it's going to it's going to be very\nvery expensive\nnot in terms of money though obviously\nthat could be one of the costs\nbut in terms of time sacrificed in order\nto obtain the desired result remember\nvalue is derived by sacrifice i i made a\nvideo about that a while back\nand the biggest sacrifices that we can\never make are time-based sacrifices\nthere's also sacrifices of effort there\nare sacrifices associated with\ndiscomfort letting go of comfort letting\ngo of certainty\nsame thing in your personal life okay\ni'm looking for a relationship okay i\nwant this person to be\na nine or a ten i want them to be\nworking out three or four times a week\ni want them to be making six figures i\nwant them to have a house\ni want them to have their life together\nthey need to be emotionally available\nthey can't smoke it's like okay\nyou can have all those things but what\nare you prepared to sacrifice\nto obtain the desired result which in\nthis case would be\nwhat are you doing to make yourself more\nattractive\nto the kind of person that you want to\nhave into your life like if you want all\nthose things okay\nwell if you demand eight things of your\nhypothetical partner\nthen are you prepared to meet his or her\ntop eight demands\nfor his or her hypothetical partner if\nnot\nthen it's kind of an unreasonable\nrequest\nyou know what i'm saying so you're free\nto\nto want whatever you want but you can't\nwant whatever you want at the price that\nyou would prefer to pay\nevery time you say and the price goes up\nso that's my thoughts on the matter\nplease like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
