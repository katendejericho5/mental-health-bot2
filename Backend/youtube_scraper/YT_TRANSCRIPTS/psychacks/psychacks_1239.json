    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk is\ndon't be harmless don't be harmless\nlook the basis of respect\nin any relationship whether it's\npersonal or professional\nthe basis of respect is fear\nwe don't like to talk about this but\nthat's the basis of respect\nthat i'm afraid potentially of\nwhat this other person could do\nto negatively impact my life i'm afraid\nof being rejected\ni'm afraid that if i escalate this it\nwill lead to a physical altercation\ni'm afraid of being fired this person\nhas some power whether it's a physical\npresence\nwhether it's authority over me within a\ncertain relationship\nor hierarchy this person has the power\nto create harm\nthat's the basis of respect\nwhat makes a good person a good person\nis not being harmless\nit's being it's cultivating the capacity\nfor harm\nand simply choosing not to exercise it\nor choosing to exercise it only under\nvery restrictive conditions\nit's like think about all the\nsuperheroes\nthat exist in our popular culture it's\nlike take superman\nthat guy could become an unstoppable\nsuper villain\nhe's got he's nearly indestructible he\ncan fly around at the speed of sound\nnothing stops him he can shoot laser\nbeams and heat waves it's like\nthat guy could take over the world in a\nin a week\nif he wanted to and he simply chooses\nnot to because of his moral or ethical\nprinciples his values\nbut if he didn't have all of those\npowers which could have the potential to\ncreate harm for other people\nhe wouldn't be a hero and he certainly\nwouldn't command respect\na person who is harmless cannot create\ngood the inability to do harm\ndoes not make you good it just makes you\nharmless\nit's like a rabbit a rabbit\nis a prey animal it doesn't create a lot\nof problems for people but it doesn't\ncreate a lot of good either\nso those people the rabbits\nthey the harmless individuals they often\nstruggle with feeling disrespected in\ntheir relationships well that's why it's\nlike what's the basis of respect what\ncould they do\nthat would command that respect what's\nthe power that they have\nso if we want to be successful in our\nrelationships\nin our lives we want to cultivate our\npower which is\nparadoxically our capacity to do harm\nbecause the same capacity to do harm\nwhen it's applied in a different context\nor in a different aim actually creates\ngood\nso it you know that's something to keep\nin mind\ndon't try to be harmless don't try to be\nnice don't try to be agreeable\ncultivate that side of yourself that has\nthe potential\nto create real harm for others and\nchoose to use it\nbeneficially because then you actually\ncreate value you actually create\ngoodness\nso that's my thought on the matter uh\nplease like and subscribe we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
