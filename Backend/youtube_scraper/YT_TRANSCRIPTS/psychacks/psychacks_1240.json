    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology so the\nsubject of today's short discussion\nis that\nvalue is derived from sacrifice\nso let's talk about this in kind of a\nbasic everyday example so\num it's you know a little afternoon i'm\nthinking about going to a cafe getting a\ncup of coffee\nin order to secure that desired good i\nhave to sacrifice\nthree dollars to obtain it\nif i don't feel like the coffee is worth\nthe three dollars\ni can keep my three dollars and be happy\nabout it if i believe\nit's a fair transfer or even that the\ncoffee is is worth more to me than\nthree dollars i'll hand it over gladly\nbut i can't\nhave the coffee and the three dollars at\nthe same time\nand on some level the fact that i'm\nwilling to sacrifice\nthe three dollars in the act the\ntransfer is actually what gives\nthe value of the coffee it's three\ndollars it's it's just hypothetical\nit's value until i actually put the\nmoney\non the table for the cashier then it's\nlike oh this coffee really is worth\nthree dollars because i'm paying\nthree dollars for it okay so what does\nthis mean this means that um\nthe values the things that we have that\nwe value in life\nhave costs associated with them that's\nwhy they are called values they're\nvaluable\nand sometimes people have to pay a lot\nin order to secure them\nand the the simplest most basic way that\npeople pay for their values is with\nmoney\nthe more complex ways that people pay\nfor their values\nis through their security through their\nfreedom through their time\nthrough their energy through opportunity\num\nit's that which we choose to sacrifice\nin order to secure\nthe desired good so what does this mean\nthis means that sometimes\nwe're given the opportunity to\nunderstand just how much\nwe value our values when we have to make\nsacrifices in order to\nsecure them or to maintain them\nit's very easy to believe certain values\nit's quite another thing to have to put\nmoney on the table\nas it were or time or opportunity or\nsecurity or freedom\nin order to secure them oftentimes\npeople then\nbulk at the price they like the idea of\nthe value\nbut they aren't often willing to pay the\nprice to secure it in which case the\nvalue is actually hypothetical\nif if i'm not putting the three dollars\non the table on some level that coffee\nisn't really worth\neven three dollars to me so\nour beliefs are revealed by the extent\nto which we sacrifice to obtain or\nmaintain them\nso this can be a crossroads for people\nand one of the things i counsel my\nclients is to see\nthe opportunity to sacrifice as a good\nbecause once you sacrifice in the\nservice of your values\nthey become that much more they become\nthat much more\nworth worthy to you more valuable to you\nand those values can can support you in\nin positive and important ways\nmoving forward so that's what i have to\nsay about that please like and subscribe\nwe'll talk more in future episodes"
