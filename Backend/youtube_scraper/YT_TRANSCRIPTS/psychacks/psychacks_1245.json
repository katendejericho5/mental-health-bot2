    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis the very worst question you can ask\nyourself and i talk about this with my\nclients all the time\nit's a very innocuous seeming question\nand it is\nwhat do i feel like doing today\nnow the question what do i feel like\ndoing today seems very harmless on the\nsurface but in my opinion is one of the\nmost\ndangerous questions a person can ask him\nor herself and the reason for that\nis that if you're like me\nin the vast majority of human beings\nyou're likely\nin any given moment going to prefer\nthe comfortable the easy\nthe convenient the painless\noption among your\nyour currently available menu of\nalternatives\nuh it seems like human beings were just\nsort of biologically\nprogrammed in that way and you know it's\nnice to feel pleasure it's nice to be\ncomfortable from time to time\nbut nothing worth having in life\nis ever gotten through taking the easy\nconvenient comfortable path\nand if we leave our day\nto be decided by our emotions\nour days are mostly going to be tending\nin the direction of the comfortable\neasing the convenient which is generally\nto the detriment of our long-term plans\nso rather than ask ourselves what do i\nfeel like doing\nwe plan at least\none day in advance which means that we\nplan tomorrow today\nnow you don't have to plan it down to\nthe minute but you should know more or\nless\nwhere you need to be when and what are\nthe tasks that you've decided that you\nwant to accomplish\nfor that day before it happens\nso that when the time shows up and you\nshow up into tomorrow\nyou can just you can just show up you\nalready know what you're there to do\nyou can just you can just go through it\nand pass through that moment and do what\nhas already been decided\ntreat that activity planning as if\nit's a decision that is ironclad like it\ncame from something\nother than yourself um\nand then you just have to show up and\nlook pretty as i say you get to\nenjoy the experience and pass through\nthe experience and\nas a result of that you've accomplished\nthings at the end of the day\nyou've either made money or you've\nworked on writing that book\nor you've done the gardening that you've\nbeen putting off or you've called that\nperson that you've been\nsort of avoiding for a while it's like\nat the end of the day\nyou can see i did this this this and\nthis not because i\nfelt like doing it but because it had\nalready been decided\nthat today was the day that i was going\nto do x y and z\nand in this way you can begin to more\nintentionally shape\nthe course and direction of your life\nso that you can meet\nreally impressive and meaningful\nlong-term personal goals so we'll\ndefinitely talk more about this in\nfuture episodes please like and\nsubscribe and\ni'll see you next time"
