    "transcript": "[Music]\ni'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's brief conversation\nwill be to be to have a peaceful garden\nit's necessary to be a ruthless gardener\nokay so if you want to be able to enjoy\na quiet\nand well-ordered garden where\nthings flourish in proportion to each\nother\nwhere the herbs and the flowers um\nyou know pour forth their redlands and\ntheir bounty\nwhere everything is sort of sweet and\nlively it's actually behind the scenes\nrequired to be\na ruthless and cruel\ngardener to everything that isn't\nconducive to that environment we don't\njust like\nyou know cut cut the weeds down a good\ngardener\npulls the roots out from its the weeds\nout from their very roots there's this\ngreat word called deracinate which means\nto pull out from the roots\nand it does it even when it's small and\nsoft and vulnerable it cruelly\nand callously takes it out of the earth\nwhich is you know\nthe medium of cultivation for it to grow\nso there is a sort of discipline around\nbeing a gardener which is that you\ncan't allow weeds to proliferate\nand the longer you wait the more of a\nproblem you tend to have on your hands\nit's not like the weeds will ever really\ngo away by their own accord the problem\nonly gets bigger\nand more extensive as time goes on\nso the idea here is to know what type of\ngarden you want\nand to take action in defense and in\nsupport of that\nenvironment because you know a weed is\ndetermined\nit's the unwanted flower there's nothing\nnecessarily\ninherently bad about that plant it's\njust that it's not wanted\nat that time in that place in that\nvision of a garden\nso what uh what is a wheat is defined by\nour vision\nif we don't have a vision then it's like\nwhat's a weed uh what's a flower\nyou know anything can kind of grow there\nand it's just this sort of\nyou know chaos this profusion of\nundifferentiated life\nso once you have a vision of what you\nwant then implicitly you kind of have an\nidea of what you don't want\nand what is not conducive to its\nrealization\nso in order to def defend\nto guard against um the encroachment of\nchaos\nwe have to be vigilant and disciplined\nwith the deracination\nof that which undermines our vision\nkind of no exceptions it needs to be\npulled out by the roots\nit needs to be you know exterminated at\nits source\nso this is something that\nwe can do specifically in our own minds\nso this is a metaphor for our own\npsychology our minds are like gardens we\ncan\nlive inside of them in an ordered and\npeaceful way but in order to do that we\nhave to\nbe very disciplined and energetic\nabout exercising the weeds which are the\nthe\nthinking the thoughts the cognitions\nthat contribute to undermining that\norder and peacefulness so that's what i\nhave to say about that\nplease like and subscribe and we'll talk\nmore bye"
