    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is every\nwoman is two women this is very\nimportant for all men to appreciate more\naccurately each woman is at least two\nwomen but today we're going to focus on\nthe two women that absolutely live\ninside of every woman the first woman is\nthe public facing Persona this is the\nwoman that you know and interact with on\nthe job or in the Community or on a date\nand the second woman is the bedroom\nPersona this is the woman that you only\never meet behind closed doors in the\ncontext of a sexual encounter and these\ntwo women are not the same\nwomen sometimes not even close and I'm\ngoing to be talking about some of the\nrepercussions of this dichotomy in\ntoday's talk in the first place you need\nto understand that I'm talking about the\nbedroom metaphorically not the literal\nphysical location which is present in\none spot but a contextual location which\nis present whenever and wherever sex\noccurs now when it comes to sexuality\nthe bedroom is like the wild west and it\nwill kind of always be like that\nconnected as it is to reproduction and\ntherefore to life itself sex will never\never be wholly civilized after all all's\nfair and Love and War which is to say\nthat where survival is at stake either\nthrough life or death we acknowledge\nthat all bets are off this is why the\nbedroom is kind of an anything goes type\nof territory with very few if any rules\nthat govern what actually go down in any\ncase there's the public facing Persona\nand the bedroom Persona and they're not\nthe same person for all intents and\npurposes just like it would be\ninappropriate to engage the public\nfacing Persona sexually even if you were\nin a sexual relationship with that woman\nit's kind of appropriate to engage the\nbedroom Persona\nnon-sexually either one is likely going\nto lead to complaints and hurt feelings\nit's like the public facing Persona has\nto be treated in a certain way and the\nbedroom Persona has to be treated in a\ncertain other way each after its own\nfashion and this is important for men to\nremember for a number of reasons first\nand foremost it's actually very very\ndifficult to tell what a woman's bedroom\nPersona will be until you get her in the\nbed room even through careful\nobservation of her public facing Persona\nit will be difficult to predict what\nshe's going to be like behind closed\ndoors from my own experience there are\ngirls who seem to be squeaky clean on\nthe outside like they seem conventional\ninnocent even pure nice girls who to\nlook at them you might think they had\nnever even had a naughty thought but who\nare the nastiest freakiest girls\nimaginable when the curtains have been\ndrawn by the the same token there are\nsome women who look totally wild they're\nall tatted up with provocative clothing\nand edgy attitudes but who are fairly\ntimid and conservative when you get them\nin the bedroom the upshot is that the\npublic facing Persona rarely affords\ngood consistent information with respect\nto the bedroom Persona and women I think\noften don't adequately appreciate how\ndifficult it is for most men to navigate\nthis dichotomy For Better or Worse we t\nto think that how she is out in public\nis more or less how she is going to be\nin the bedroom and this misunderstanding\ncauses both men and women to miss out on\nall kinds of potentially satisfying\nrelationships now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing then please consider sending\nthis episode to someone who might\nbenefit from its message because it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally helped to make the channel grow\nI'm also proud to announce that I'll\nsoon be publishing my book the value of\nothers so if you'd like to learn more\nabout that then you can go to my website\nand sign up for my Weekly Newsletter\nfinally please fill out an inquiry form\non my website if you're interested in\nbooking a paid consultation the link is\nin the description okay let's get back\nto\nit probably one of the most common\ninstances of this fallacy this\nconflation of the public facing and the\nbedroom personas is the phenomenon of\nthe boss so there are a lot of\nwomen in the west today who are doing\nvery well at least from the standpoint\nof material success many are competent\nand accomplished and they have attained\nto positions of power and authority and\nall kinds of organizations now the\npublic facing personas of these women\ntend to be more masculine or assertive\nbecause those traits functionally help\nthem to compete successfully in the\nprofessional Arena however it would be a\nmistake to assume that this is how these\nsame women necessarily behave behind\nclosed doors in fact many of women are\nlooking to relax into their feminine if\nnot be outright dominated in their\nsexual\nrelationships the issue is that men kind\nof assume that the public facing Persona\nis isomorphic with the bedroom Persona\nand this scares a lot of guys off not\nbecause these women intimidate like men\nare not afraid of these women but\nbecause assertiveness and\ncompetitiveness isn't what the vast\nmajority of men are seeking in their\nintimate relationships most guys want to\nbe the in the dominant role Visa their\nwomen and they think H it's going to be\na power struggle every time I try to\ntake the lead here and they pass these\nwomen over and this is potentially\nunfortunate because it's actually quite\npossible that the woman might want the\nsame thing as the man but that's not the\nvibe she's putting off with her public\nfacing Persona so she's got a marketing\nproblem on her hands now some women are\ninappropriately competitive with their\nmen and some some women are going to\nfeel more comfortable in the driver's\nseat but I would say that most women\nactually want the man to wear the pants\nin the relationship so guys it's\nimportant to remember that how she\nbehaves out in public is not necessarily\nhow she's going to behave behind closed\ndoors and ladies it's important to\nremember you're potentially dealing with\na target audience who finds it difficult\nto remember that the same thing goes for\nwomen who seem too pure for this world\nmen might pass them by because they\nmight think well I'm full of all these\ndepraved sexual desires and there's no\nway this woman would go in for that\nhowever that isn't necessarily true\neither and in general the more a woman\nis attracted to you the more she's going\nto be willing to at least try out\ncertain things in the bedroom trust me\nit's often the case that women are even\nfreakier than the men they get involved\nwith so try not to make assumptions\nabout her desires before they're\nwarranted now a deep appreciation of\nthis fact will start to mess with your\nconceptualization of women because I'm\ntelling you every woman is these two\nwomen that means your sisters are these\ntwo women your mothers are these two\nwomen all of your female classmates and\ncolleagues and neighbors are these two\nwomen every woman on this planet\npossesses these two versions of\nthemselves and this means that every\nwoman on this planet has to learn learn\nhow to navigate this ambiguity within\nthemselves especially because women\nreceive all kinds of conflicting\nmessages about their sexuality from\nsociety some women attempt to resolve\nthis ambiguity by just collapsing the\ndichotomy they're hyper controlled and\ngenerally hyper controlling and they try\nto civilize the bedroom as much as\npossible there is no Wild West anymore\njust Law and Order all the time under a\nVigilant surveillance State yay\non the other hand there are women\nusually young women who collapse the\ndichotomy in the opposite direction\nthey're under regulated with poor\nboundaries and inappropriately\nsexualized interactions that have no\nbusiness being sexual with these women\nit's only the wild west and anything\ngoes which will eventually motivate you\nto develop Vigilant surveillance as you\nwon't otherwise know when you're about\nto be ambushed as might be expected\nneither one of these situations is\nparticularly ideal and most women\nresolve this ambiguity by kind of\ncompartmentalizing the two in different\ndimensions of reality but that leads to\nthe misunderstanding that I discussed\nearlier in this episode and this is also\na big part of why sexual relationships\nare generally a role of the dice which I\nwill discuss more in future episodes\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below
