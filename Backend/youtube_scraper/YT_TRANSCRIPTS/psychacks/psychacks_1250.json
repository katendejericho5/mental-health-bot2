    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis love is abundant this is also\nsomething\nthat i discuss over and over again with\nmy clients\na lot of people stay in less than\nsatisfying relationships or even\ndestructive or abusive relationships\nbecause of their scarcity mentality\nwhich is basically like hey\nyou know this is a problematic\nrelationship and yet it might be the\nbest relationship i've been able to get\nup until this point in time\ni remember how difficult it was to even\nget this flawed relationship\nisn't this flawed relationship better\nthan no relationship at all\nwell that's not always true actually\nsometimes being in a bad or mediocre\nrelationship\nprovides an opportunity cost that\nprevents you from getting into a better\nmore rewarding relationship\nthere's that um\nbut the issue here is that there's a\nscarcity mentality which is that love\nis a rare precious\nunusual element\nlike uranium and it's something that\nhas great value and\nwe don't just we don't just throw it\naway when it um\nlike uranium when it burns us and\nwhat i'd like to suggest is that love\nparticularly between\num people in a romantic relationship is\nvery abundant love is extremely\ncommon and it's it's something that\nevolves and develops along very\npredictable\nlines it's also an experience that you\ncan have\nwith literally millions and millions of\nother people on this planet\nif you take two people and you\nrepeatedly see each other\nonce or twice a week for a few months\nif you throw in regular sexual contact\num\ni don't care what your intentions were\nthat you're just going to keep it casual\nthat you don't want to catch feelings um\nif you spend time with somebody\nover and over and over again and you\nthrow in sexual intimacy\nit's inevitable that you will become\nemotionally\ninvolved with that person it's\nit happens whether you want to or not\nnow some people might deny that and they\nmight resist it\nor they might take action in the\nrelationship in the structured\nrelationship\nto prevent it from fluorescing however\nthat's it\nit's like that emotional attachment you\nhave to somebody is is largely\num familiarity plus intimacy and that's\nsomething that you can literally have\nwith almost anybody on the planet who's\nwilling to\nto show up and reciprocate in that way\nthis of course means that one it's\nimportant to\nbe intentional about who you decide to\nspend your time with\nbecause it's inevitable that emotional\nbonds will develop\njust through repetition and exposure but\nit also means that you don't need to be\nso protective about\nletting go of something that's no longer\nserving it doesn't even have to be bad\nmaybe just\nyou want something different or this\nisn't the direction that you want your\nlife to go in at a\ncurrent moment to know that there are\nplenty of other people in the world\ni can spend time with them i can\nopen myself up emotionally and and to\nwitness the\nemotional opening of the other person\nand if you do that\nyou know you mix it up you bake for\nfour to six months that's what you're\ngonna get um\nvery common love is very common all\nright\nthank you for listening we'll talk more\nin future episodes please like and\nsubscribe"
