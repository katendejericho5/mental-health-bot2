    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\ntoday i'd like you to consider that your\nfeelings\nare not personal this is a\nsomewhat very strange to talk about\nfeelings in this way because\nfor a lot of us feelings are like the\nmost personal part of our experience\nit's because of all of the chemicals\nthat create the somatic\nexperience inside of us the fact that i\ncan't feel your feelings\nyou can't feel my feelings uh people are\nsubject to identifying with their\nemotions as a result\num but i'm under the opinion that our\nfeelings aren't really\npersonal rather they're the consequence\nof our thinking behind every feeling\nis a thought and thoughts are\nare fairly impersonal i could write down\nsome of my thoughts on a piece of paper\nhand it to you you could read\nthat piece of paper and suddenly my\nthought is in your head\nand if we both choose to believe the\nsame thought we will likely\nthen experience very similar emotions as\na result\nso for example if i were to think the\nthought you know i'm a worthless\nindividual and nobody loves me\nand i really were to believe that to be\ntrue\nit would be very difficult for me not to\nfeel somewhat dejected\nand depressed and if you also were to\nthink that thought that that i am a\nworthless individual nobody loves me and\nyou really believe that it's true\nyou likely will also feel dejected\nand um somewhat depressed it would be\nvery difficult to think\nthat thought believe it to be true and\nfeel let's say content\nand confident so\nour feelings have more to do with what\nwe\nchoose to believe to be true than who we\nare as a person\nand on some level the same feeling or a\nvery similar feeling\ncan be cultivated in other people simply\nas a consequence of sharing similar\nideas or beliefs\nso what does this mean this means that\nif we want to\ncultivate different emotional states we\nhave to be\nvery intentional about the thoughts that\nwe\nchoose to validate the thoughts that we\nchoose to believe to be true\nit's not possible to believe certain\nthings are true\nand feel however we want this is\nsomething i often say to my clients\nis that you're free to think however you\nwant\nhowever you're not free to feel however\nyou wish\nas a consequence of what you choose to\nthink so for example if a person chooses\nto think those thoughts\nlike for example i'm a worthless\nindividual and nobody really cares about\nme\nthat person really on some level isn't\nfree\nto feel contented and confident\nas a consequence of thinking those\nthoughts\nnow it's not an easy thing to simply\nchange the way that\nsomebody thinks but it is possible and\nit's the best\none of the best routes towards creating\nsustainable\nemotional change in an individual we'll\ntalk more about how to do that in future\nepisodes\nso please like and subscribe and stay\ntuned for some more"
