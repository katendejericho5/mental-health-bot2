    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks\nbetter living through psychology and the\nsubject of today's short talk\nis be the person that you can love\nso i talk to a lot of folks in my\nclinical practice and\nthey often feel in the core of their\ntheir being\nthat they're not enough that they're\ninsufficient or that they're\nunlovable for some reason and that's\nobviously inherently painful and it\ncauses them to go out in the world and\ntry to prove\nto themselves through other people that\nthey are enough\nand they try to substitute let's say the\napproval or the respect\nor the recognition of other people\nto fill in that hole inside of their own\nheart\nthat says that they're actually not\nenough and this is\nthis is a losing game i've discovered\nthat you can't\nsolve internal problems with external\nsolutions and\nvice versa it's like square peg round\nhole so\nwe want to heal that wound directly that\nsays that i'm not enough\nthat i'm unlovable nobody likes me or\nrespects me\nand the solution to that is to be the\nperson\nthat you can love so do some\nvisualization it's like\nwhat do you look like what kinds of\nthings are you doing what's your job\nwhere are you living who are you\nassociating with\nthat's the person that you could be\nmaybe not\nin six weeks or six months but maybe in\nsix years you could be that person or at\nleast you can make significant progress\ntowards approximating that person and\nthat's kind of the art of life\nwhere we take on this role of creator\nand\nyou know our own our own bodies and\nminds are the\nthe medium for that artistry is that we\ncan transform and create ourselves\nin line with our vision of who we want\nto be\nand the idea here is to choose a vision\nof ourselves it's not based on what we\nthink that we should be or what our\nparents think we should be or what our\nsociety thinks that we should be\nbut who we would\nactually authentically legitimately love\nand respect\nit's very hard to love and respect\nyourself if you're not doing anything\nlovable or respectable\nso that's kind of that's kind of it\nfirst stop doing the things\nthat make you feel ashamed or\npathetic and start doing the things that\nyou\nyourself can love and admire and respect\nso this generally means some kind of\ngoal attainment or achievement\nso get busy doing things generally\nchallenging things that you can\nappropriately overcome so you can say\nwow um i did that and i can actually\nfeel proud of myself for having done\nthat\ni've never run a marathon for example\nbut i know that it would take\nsix months of training it would be very\npainful i'd have to overcome the obvious\ndiscomfort and difficulty with this\nthe day of the marathon my shoes might\nfill with blood i want to give up\nthere's a stitch in the side and if i\ndon't quit and i actually quit i\nfinished\nacross that finish line i'm going to\nfeel legitimately proud of what i was\nable to accomplish\nand you chain enough of those things\ninto your life\nand you become somebody that you can\nrespect\nand the whole problem of getting other\npeople to acknowledge that it sort of\ndisappears\nbecause the internal problem has\nresolved itself with an internal\nsolution\nso the seeking after the external\nsolution it becomes redundant and\nirrelevant\nokay that's my thoughts on the matter\nplease like and subscribe and we'll talk\nmore in future episodes"
