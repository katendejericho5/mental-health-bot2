    "transcript": "my rule of thumb though the France\nexample kind of contradicts that what\nI'm about to say is it's the cultures\nthat haven't historically been steeped\nin judeo-christian religion so either\nChristianity or Islam in particular they\ntend to have a more let's say honest\ntolerance for almost like human nature\nand I think part of what makes that kind\nof monogamish or asymmetrical\nrelationship difficult in the west is\nthat the primary value in the west is\nequality and egalitarianism whereas in\nthe East you have more of a confucianist\nthing that even if it's not completely\npracticed today it's like in the culture\nit's in the tradition which is people\nare not equal but there are\nresponsibilities and privileges owed and\nexpected of each person in that unequal\nrelationship and as long as everybody\nkind of honors those responsibilities\nand expectations there is social harmony\nbut we don't want to pretend that\neverybody is the same and everyone is\nequal"
