    "transcript": "do you think the concept of monogamy is\nmaybe outdated some people are wired for\nmonogamy other people it not so much\nthere's a concept of being monogamish I\ndidn't invent that word I think that\nmight have come from maybe Esther Perell\nbut don't quote me on that monogamish is\nthe idea that I can be 90 95% sexually\nexclusive but attempting to be 100 is\nprobably going to lead to Too Much\nTemptation over a long enough timeline\nand it will lead to lying cheating and\nthe dissolution of the relation ship so\nwhy even do that if I know that I can't\ndeal with that over a long enough\ntimeline why put my neck in the news and\nthe fact of the matter is though they\nmight not publicly admit it if your 95%\nas a man is significantly better than\n100% from the other men that woman could\npotentially transact with she's not\ngoing to like the idea but she's\nprobably not going to cut off her nose\nto spider face"
