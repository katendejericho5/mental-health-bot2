    "transcript": "I found that people who tend to\nprioritize self-respect Effectiveness\nabove the others also tend to have a\nrather expansive sense of self and\nbecause of this their egos tend to\nbruise easily and their pride is easily\nhurt they seem to have a lower threshold\nwith respect to what they perceive to be\na slight or an insult or a disparagement\nas a consequence these folks end up\nfighting a lot of battles and dying on a\nlot of Hills which doesn't win them many\nfriends and doesn't help them become\nsuccessful these people often end up\nalone and frustrated which ironically\ncauses them to prioritize self-respect\neven more because what else do they have\nso it can be a vicious cycle the fact of\nthe matter is that in order to get what\nyou want in life or to have satisfying\nharmonious relationships with people you\ncan't always insist that how you are\nbeing treated is the most important\nthing in life"
