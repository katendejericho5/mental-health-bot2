    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is being\nfamous is like being a woman so I'm\ngoing to go out in a limb on this one\nbecause I'm only a little bit famous and\nI'm clearly not a woman however becoming\nwell known through the YouTube channel\nhas afforded me some interesting\nexperiences experiences that as far as I\ncan tell just wouldn't have been\npossible as the functionally anonymous\nman I was just year ago and I'd like to\nshare some of those experiences with you\ntoday nowadays I get recognized when I\ngo out in public and people from all\nover the world both men and women reach\nout to me unprovoked for all kinds of\ndifferent reasons needless to say\nneither of these things tended to happen\nbefore the channel blew up and I'd like\nto start by talking about one of the\nfirst such messages I received about a\nyear ago back when the channel had just\na few million views I actually can't\nremember if this was a comment or a DM\nor an email and I'm embarrassed to say\nthat I don't remember the name of the\nsender or the business but I do remember\nthe thrust of the message which is the\nimportant part for our intents and\npurposes apparently the guy who\ncontacted me was a barber who worked at\na barber shop in San Francisco he told\nme that he and all the other guys in the\nshop loved my stuff and when they\nlearned that I lived in the area they\ncollectively invited me to come in for a\nhaircut on the\nhouse now I never took the guy up on his\noffer but I wish I could give him a\nproper shout out nonetheless because his\noffer was very sweet and genuine he\nclearly didn't have to express his\nappreciation like that and I was touched\nthat he did so now it took me some time\nto realize this like it didn't hit me\nright away but this was the first time a\nstranger like someone I had never met in\nmy life had ever offered to give me\nsomething at least as far as I can\nremember I'm sure some adults gave me\nlittle treats when I was a kid but here\nI was 40 years old and I was being\noffered a gift by a stranger for the\nfirst time in my adult\nlife maybe you know where this is going\nas I often do I started to look at this\nexperience through the lens of\nBehavioral economics and the sexual\nMarketplace so the value of a haircut is\nabout 40 bucks and all I apparent had to\ndo to earn that gift was to provide\nvalue to a few million\npeople now 40 bucks is like two drinks\nat the bar over the course of my\nadulthood to how many women have I made\nan equivalent\noffer like the barber I was often a\ntotal stranger to these women and I was\njust showing up unannounced with an\noffer to give them something and I and\nnot because they did anything\nparticularly impressive or useful or\nexciting or virtuous but just because I\nthought they looked cute and I did this\nnot because I was grateful like the\nbarber was after all what did I have to\nbe grateful for these women hadn't done\nanything but because I thought that\noffering that gift would increase the\nchances of initiating a sexual\nrelationship with her and of course if I\nwas offering these gifts to her how many\nother men were doing the same now before\nI go any further if you're liking what\nyou're hearing then please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow I'm also proud to announce that\nI'll soon be publishing my book

you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to it\nthis is why being famous is like being a\nwoman on the whole when you're famous\npeople treat you really really\nwell like at this point I can kind of\ncount on a guy coming up to me to pay\nhis respects like several times a week\nhe'll come up and say hey are are you\nthat guy whoa let me shake your hand I\nreally love what you do you've helped me\nout so much thank you for all the great\ncontent keep it up keep it up man and\nlet me tell you that's really cool like\nit's it's one of the best things about\nthe success of this channel one of the\nbest things about the success of this\nchannel is that it's allowed me to meet\nso many interesting people that I\nprobably would never have met otherwise\nand because I'm just here in my house\ntalking to a camera it's really great to\nbe able to meet the people on the other\nend of the line especially since they're\ngenerally so grateful and positive and\nencouraging like it always makes my day\nI feel happy when it happens and it\ndefinitely helps me to feel more\nconfident about moving forward with the\nchannel and now I can also kind of\nimagine what it might be like to be a\nwoman who can kind of count on a guy\ncoming up to her to pay his respect\nseveral times a week like excuse me wow\nyou're beautiful I'd love to be able to\nbuy you something sometime like a drink\na meal what do you say would you go out\nwith me like even if I was happily\nmarried how wouldn't that feel good\nhow wouldn't that feel validating and\nflattering I'm sure it would make my day\na little brighter and put a spring in my\nstep but of course the difference would\nbe that as a woman I wouldn't think that\nI did anything to deserve that kind of\nattention or\ntreatment no I would just think that I\nwas someone who deserved that kind of\nattention or treatment and why wouldn't\nI even I would know that I didn't do\nanything to earn that attention\nwhich would mean that if I was receiving\nthat attention it must be because of who\nI was not because of anything that I\nmight have done and this in turn might\ncause me in time to believe that I was\nentitled to that treatment in kind of\nthe same way that I as a man believe\nthat I'm entitled to like basic human\ndignity this is why I think so many\nwomen think that they're the prize like\ninherently most women are kind of\nlowgrade famous\nin the sense that they receive treatment\ncomparable to someone with a few hundred\nthousand followers on social media like\njust for breathing and I can only\nimagine what it would be like if people\nwere coming out of the Woodworks to pay\nme compliments and offer me gifts from a\nvery young age like what a distorted\nview of my own selfworth would I likely\nhave of course those gifts often come\nwith strings attached as I admitted\nthey're designed to functionally lure a\nwoman into a sexual Rel relationship\nhowever that would have to be mystified\nthose strings would have to stay very\nwell hidden because if I believed that I\nwas entitled to those gifts just by like\nbeing a good person I would absolutely\nbe insulted by any insinuation of an\nulterior motive or any expectation of\nreciprocity on the other hand as a man\nI've kind of had to earn any good\ntreatment that I've received generally\nby providing value to others and in this\ncase by providing value to a lot of\nother people so it's not something that\nI take for granted however I doubt that\nI would ever have thought that there was\nanything odd about this Arrangement\nuntil I attain to the very special form\nof success called Fame my dude's Fame is\nnot like wealth or ABS or status and\nthat's because those things aren't\nalways visible and obvious Fame is like\nbeing hot regardless of how physically\nattractive you actually are\nbecause like hotness Fame is highly\nvisible and immediately apparent and let\nme tell you women respond to fame the\nsame way men respond to hotness and this\nis why I have advised you guys many\ntimes to find ways to become visibly\ncompetent the kind of attention you\nreceive as a man by being visibly\ncompetent is a force multiplier in the\nsexual Marketplace like you might even\nbe disgusted by how easy things become\nbecause potentially nothing else about\nyou has changed except for the fact that\nmore people now know that you\nexist in any case my point is this I\ndon't think I would have ever fully\nappreciated how tough and unfair life\ncan be for men until my life started to\nbecome a little\neasier like I didn't even think that was\npossible\nI just kind of thought that the way\nthings were were the way they had to be\nthey're not and if we men can do one\nthing to effectively change a situation\nthat we were complicit in creating it's\nthis stop giving women unearned\nattention I know it's hard to do I did\nit myself for years but it's absolutely\na big part of why women today walk\naround with certain delusions about\ntheir own self-worth they were trained\nto think that way by the men around them\nmen like you and me something to\nconsider what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening
