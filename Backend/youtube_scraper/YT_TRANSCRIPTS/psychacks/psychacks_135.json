    "transcript": "by selectively choosing what you will\nrespond to you effectively sell your\ntime and peace and attention at a higher\nprice point communicating both to\nyourself and others that these are\nvaluable resources coming from a person\nof some worth and dignity many people\naren't respected at the levels they\nwould prefer precisely because they\ndevalue these resources through\ninflation giving your attention to\neveryone who asks for it is functionally\nlike printing more money all it\neffectively does is diminish the value\nof the resource already in circulation\nyou can never increase the value of\nsomething by creating more of it only by\ncreating less of it so by letting most\nthings slide you will begin to carry\nyourself with greater dignity and\nself-possession"
