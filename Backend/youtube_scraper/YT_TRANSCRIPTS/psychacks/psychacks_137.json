    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the court\ndoes not deal in Trifles so this is a\nphrase that I learned from a friend back\nwhen he was going through law school\napparently the Supreme Court of the\nUnited States hears between 100 and 150\ncases every year that's their session\nhowever the court is asked to review\nover\n7,000 cases a year that means that\nbetween 98 and\n99% of all petitions are dismissed\nthat's a very high reject rate and\ngenerally when the court rejects a\npetition they provide a reason for their\ndecision to do so and one of the reasons\nthe Supreme Court can give when they\nreject a petition for a hearing is the\ntitle of this episode namely the court\ndoes not deal in Trifles and this is a\nnice polite way of saying this isn't\nworth our time I first heard\nthat phrase the court does not deal in\nTrifles when I was 21 years old and it\nhas stuck with me ever since my friends\nyou have to understand that just like\nthe Supreme Court of the United States\nyou have a limited amount of time a\nlimited amount of resources and a\nlimited amount of bandwidth with which\nto deal with the of everyday\nlife and if you give your time resources\nand bandwidth to to any one thing you\nare not giving it to anything else\nwithin the context of necessary scarcity\nattending to that which truly does not\nmatter is an enormous liability for\nseveral important reasons in the first\nplace it lowers your station and dignity\nthings only really have value at the\npoint of transaction and that includes\nintangibles that means for instance if\nyou're going to lose your every\ntime you suffer a minor inconvenience\nthen that's exactly how much your piece\nis worth a minor inconvenience and it's\nworth that much because apparently it\nonly takes a minor inconvenience to\npurchase your\npiece by the same token if you're going\nto respond to every niggling criticism\nsomeone throws in your general direction\nthen that's exactly how much your time\nis worth a niggling criticism and it's\nworth that much because apparently it\nonly takes a niggling criticism to\npurchase your time and you've decided\nthat your peace and time are worth that\nmuch because you decided to engage which\nis to say you decided to transact at\nthat price point on the other hand by\nselectively choosing what you will\nrespond to you effectively sell your\ntime and peace and attention at a higher\nprice point communicating both to\nyourself and others that these are\nvaluable resources coming from a person\nof some worth and dignity many people\naren't respected at the levels they\nwould prefer precisely because they\ndevalue these resources through\ninflation giving your attention to\neveryone who asks for it is functionally\nlike printing more money all it\neffectively does is diminish the value\nof the resource already in circulation\nyou can never increase the value of\nsomething by creating more of it only by\ncreating less of it so by letting most\nthings slide you will begin to carry\nyourself with greater dignity and\nself-possession in the second place it's\nimportant to understand that not all\ntime which is generally your most\nvaluable resource is equally valuable\npeople say that you have 24 hours in a\nday that's not really true you're\nspending at least 10 of those hours\nsleeping and attending to necessary\nself-care that leaves 14 hours however\nyou don't even really have 14 hours in a\nday\nthis is because people have a limited\nbandwidth with respect to their focused\nattention for most folks this is between\nfour and six hours a day I call these\nhours the golden time and it's when\npeople are at their Peak mental\nfunctioning for all intents and purposes\nthese are the only hours you really have\nin a given day at least with respect to\nany tasks requiring high levels of\ncreativity or concentration or physical\nexertion or careful reasoning or\nperformative Charisma Etc that means\nthat if you squander these hours you\nfunctionally squander the entire day now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really helped to make the channel\ngrow I'm also proud to announce that\nI'll soon be publishing my book the\nvalue of others so if you'd like to\nlearn more about that then you can go

let's get back to\nit now your golden time should be\nguarded very jealously you should not be\nresponding to emails during that time\nyou should not be sitting in meetings\nduring that time you should not be\nallowing your wife or your friends or\nyour family to introduce unnecessary\nproblems into that time this is because\nattending to these demands during the\ngolden time is a\nmisallocation of resources if the\nSupreme Court used one of its 100\nhearings to adjudicate a spat between\nneighbors with respect to where their\nproperty line is to be drawn that would\nbe a slap in the nation's face by the\nsame token if you are texting with your\ngirlfriend about her frustrations with a\ncoworker during your golden time that\nwould be a slap in your own face you\nwould would be disrespecting your own\ntime and you communicate that your time\nisn't worth much more than serving as a\npassive receptacle for an impotent\nfrustration guard your time more\njealously don't expect others to do it\nfor\nyou this means that you will likely have\nto start saying no a lot more often and\nthat's not a word that is often well\nreceived especially by women however\nthat's not your problem how people\nrespond to feedback is their problem how\nyou guard your own time is your problem\ndon't get it mixed up this means that\nyou don't have to manage their reaction\nto your feedback and they don't have to\nprotect your time everyone has enough on\ntheir own plates without eating off\nanyone else's and guess what if a\ncertain problem is a trifle then any\nproblem created by not dealing with that\ntrifle is also a trifle it's even\nsmaller than a trifle it's it's like a\nmicro trifle it's like a nanot trifle\ndon't allow other people's reactive\nnoise to influence your judgment over\nthe significance of the original issue\ntelling people no will be disappointing\nto certain people however you have to\nappreciate that the alternative to this\nis disappointing Yourself by doing\nviolence to your own judgment and\npriorities and if you're ever put in a\nsituation which is usually done against\nyour will by another person in which you\nare forced to make a decision between\nbetween disappointing yourself and\ndisappointing someone else than failing\nany explicit agreement to the contrary\ndisappoint the other person like that\nshould be the default decision\nhere now if you say you're going to do\nsomething you should do it and if you\nsay you're not going to do something you\nshouldn't do it but in the absence of\nThat explicit agreement if someone is\njust operating under the unjustified\nexpectation that they somehow deserve\nyour time or they are entitled your\nattention or they should be able to\nexpect certain consideration just\nbecause they are dating you or because\nthey are a friend or a family member\nthen they are mistaken this is not\nnecessarily true like we certainly\nprioritize these people over random\nfolks in society but even these Intimate\nRelationships do not come with\nfunctional entitlements that haven't\nbeen mutually and explicitly\nnegotiated failing to appropriately\ndisappoint others often creates\nresentment which will corrode a person's\ncontentment and willingness to\nenthusiastically remain in the\nrelationship in the long term and this\nis your responsibility to do just like\nit's the Court's responsibility to\nreject 99% of its petitions this is\nespecially important to remember because\nthere are plenty of people who exist in\nthe world who will keep taking until\nthey are actively\nresisted they're not going to pick up on\nyour sign signals or read the room or\nknow better that's an extremely passive\nif not an extremely passive aggressive\nposition to take and it also disempowers\nyou as it functionally Awards another\nperson control over your time and peace\ntake that power back say no reject deny\ndisappoint ignore why because the court\ndoes not deal in Trifles just because\nit's important to someone else does not\nnecessarily mean that it has to be\nimportant to you don't even give your\nattention to things if they don't pass a\ncertain threshold of significance\nsomething to consider what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below as\nalways I appreciate your support and\nthank you for listening and
