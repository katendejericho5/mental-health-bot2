    "transcript": "we have to understand that we we don't\nhave a lot of good models for\nrelationships like on some level it's\nmarriage or hooking up or nothing at all\nand that doesn't work for a lot of\npeople and the way that we kind of\napproach marriage in in this culture is\nI call it a hyper conflated idea because\nwe want lots of different things we want\na legal contract we want a religious\ncommitment we want cohabitation we want\nco-parenting we want a passionate lover\nwe want a best friend and other people\nmight want a therapist or a mommy or a\ndaddy or a personal chef or a maid all\nkinds of things right and that's just\nreally really hard to deliver all of\nthose things indefinitely to one person\nfor the remainder of your life and I\ndon't think that's necessarily what we\nshould be doing I don't think that's how\nit was 100 200 years ago we didn't put\nthat pressure that our spouse was going\nto be an entire Village of people"
