    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nproblem with\nself-respect like anything under the sun\nthere is nothing that is completely\npositive everything is a trade off\neverything is a mixture of positive and\nnegative of benefit and liability\nfurthermore everything comes with a cost\nincluding values in fact that's one way\nto think about values they Valu well bow\nwhich is to say they're costly they're\nexpensive and self-respect is no\ndifferent and I think this is really\nimportant because in today's day and age\nwe collectively seem to act as if there\nis no downside to self-respect that is\nnot only is self-respect unilaterally a\npositive but that it is a value all\npeople should prioritize Above All\nThings in fact when people prioritize\nanother goal above their self-respect we\ntend to think that they must be weak or\nscared damaged or otherwise pitiable and\nwhile they're absolutely is a time to\nprioritize\nself-respect it's probably less often\nthan most people\nbelieve let me\nexplain since I've already spoken on\ndialectical behavior therapy a few times\non this channel you know that I hold\nthis treatment in very high regard in\nthe interpersonal Effectiveness module\nof DBT Marshall linahan talks about the\nthree possible goals of any human\ninteraction ideally we achieve all three\nof these goals however like any ideal\nthis is actually extremely rare in any\ncase even if we do achieve all three we\ntypically can't achieve all three\nequally which suggests that we have to\nprioritize these goals in our dealings\nwith others and linahan argues that to\nthe extent that we do this skillfully\nand intentionally which depends among\nother things on our ability to flexibly\nadapt to changing conditions we are more\nlikely to have satisfying relationships\nas with many things pertaining to mental\nhealth flexibility is key if people just\nprioritize one of the goals all of the\ntime irrespective of the goal this tends\nto lead to suboptimal outcomes so what\nare the three goals they\nare objective Effectiveness which is\ngetting what you want relationship\nEffectiveness which is making sure that\nthe other person feels good about you at\nthe end of the interaction and\nself-respect Effectiveness which is\nmaking sure that you feel good about\nyourself at the end of the interaction\nagain ideally people get all three\npeople feel good about giving us what we\nwant and we feel good about getting it\nhowever in reality this is not always\nthe case depending on the situation we\nsometimes need to prioritize one of the\ngoals over over the other two and this\nobviously comes at a cost namely the\ncost of the other two\ngoals to understand what that might look\nlike let's consider some extreme\nexamples prioritizing objective\nEffectiveness over relationship and\nself-respect Effectiveness could look\nsomething like I don't care if you hate\nme I don't care if you never speak to me\nagain and I don't care what I have to do\nto get it but I will get it I will beg\nborrow and steal to get it I will\nperform any number of shameful Unholy\nacts to get it I am prioritizing my goal\nabove all other\nthings okay and there is a time and a\nplace for that strategy on the other\nhand prioritizing relationship\nEffectiveness over objective and\nself-respect Effectiveness could look\nsomething like I don't care if I don't\nget what I want I don't care if my\npreferences or interests or desires are\ntaken into account I just want you to be\nhappy I just want you to get what you\nwant even if that means that I have to\nperform any number of shameful and\nUnholy things to ensure that\ngoal all right and there's a time and a\nplace for that strategy as\nwell and what happens when people\nprioritize self-respect Effectiveness\nover objective and relationship\nEffectiveness this could look something\nlike you crossed a line that shouldn't\nhave been crossed at this point\nI don't even care if I get what I want\nand I certainly don't care if you hate\nme or never speak to me again I'm\nprepared to hold this line and to pay\nany price and incur any expense in doing\nso to stand up for myself or to stand up\nfor this value on\nprinciple make sense and there's a time\nand a place for this strategy as\nwell at this point however the\nliabilities associated with unduly\nprioritizing self self respect\nEffectiveness should be obvious people\nwho tend to prioritize self-respect\nabove all other things tend not to get\nwhat they want and tend not to be in\nrelationships and this is expected\nbecause they sacrifice the other two\ngoals objective Effectiveness getting\nwhat they want and relationship\nEffectiveness maintaining their\nrelationships in order to prioritize\ntheir self-respect\nit should go without saying but it can\nbe very difficult to deal with people\nwho tend to unduly prioritize\nself-respect over the other two as a\nhabit and this is due to the fact that\nthese people\nunfortunately operate under the\nassumption that they can be difficult\nand contentious and\nself-focused and other people will still\nhappily give them what they want and\nthis my\nfriends is insane for For Better or\nWorse the cost of self-respect is the\nother two goals the more a person\ninsists on the one the more he or she\nforos the\nothers now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode

in\nbooking a paid consultation the links to\neverything are in the description below\nplease check them out because it's how\nyou can support this Channel and its\nMission I really appreciate it okay\nlet's get back to\nit I found that people who tend to\nprioritize self-respect Effectiveness\nabove the others also tend to have a\nrather expansive sense of self and\nbecause of this their egos tend to\nbruise easily and their pride is easily\nhurt they seem to have a lower threshold\nwith respect to what they perceive to be\na slight or an insult or a disparagement\nas a consequence these folks end up\nfighting a lot of battles and dying on a\nlot of Hills which doesn't win them many\nfriends and doesn't help them become\nsuccessful these people often end up\nalone and frustrated which ironically\ncauses them to prioritize self-respect\neven more because what else do they have\nso it can be a vicious\ncycle the fact of the matter is that in\norder to get what you want in life or to\nhave satisfying harmonious relationships\nwith people you can't always insist that\nhow you are being treated is the most\nimportant thing in life for example\nobjective Effectiveness is often\nassociated with learning how to play the\ngame if you want to climb the corporate\nladder or further your career you can't\nbe standing up for yourself all the time\ncan you sometimes you have to go along\nwith things that you disagree with\nsometimes you have to strategically\ncultivate relationships you're not going\nto get there by just insisting that you\ndeserve better by the same token if you\nwant peaceful loving relationships you\ncan't always be putting your own\nsubjective experience front and center\ncan you sometimes you have to learn to\nshut the up to bite your tongue to\nlet things slide and to give other\npeople what they need and want if you\nhave no filter fter if you are difficult\nand\ncontentious if you won't give other\npeople what they need and want then\ndon't be surprised if people don't like\nyou as much pride is cold company don't\nexpect other people to love and respect\nyou if you behave this way now as I've\nalready said there is a time and a place\nto prioritize self-respect however this\nis typically when dealing with flagrant\ndisrespect or some form of abuse\nexploitation though the definition of\nall of these words has expanded\nsignificantly in the past few years\nwhich is actually very problematic for a\nnumber of reasons people shouldn't be\ndealing with these things on a regular\nbasis and this means that prioritizing\nself-respect shouldn't be a frequent\noccurrence and if you do find yourself\ndealing with these things on a regular\nbasis you might better Serve Yourself by\nexamining why you seem to end up in\ndisrespectful abusive or exploitative\nrelationships on a regular basis than by\nfighting yet another battle in an\ninterminable succession of conflicts get\nout of the situation and do some\nself-reflection remember prioritizing\nobjective Effectiveness or relational\nHarmony over your self-respect doesn't\nnecessarily make you weak or damaged or\nbeta or whatever negative judgment you\nwant to use it might make you\neffective however like so many things in\nlife the trick is to cultivate the\nwisdom to know when to prioritize one\ngoal over the others what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below as\nalways I appreciate your support and\nthank you for listening"
