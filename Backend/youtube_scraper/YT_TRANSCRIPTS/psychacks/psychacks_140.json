    "transcript": "when I talk to women about this I always\nask well why don't you approach men and\nask them out and they invariably say\nwell I'm nervous well what are you\nnervous about I guess I'm nervous about\nbeing rejected it's like you don't Fu\nsay the same is true for men men are\nalso afraid of being rejected and\nfrankly the risks associated with men\napproaching women these days are much\nhigher than the risks associated with\nwomen approaching men and yet you women\nstill don't do it do you so if you're\nnot going to approach men at least make\nit easier for the men you like to\napproach you the more signs you give a\nman that you are open to a conversation\nthe more signals you give him that you\nwould say yes if he asked you out the\nmore likely he is going to approach you\nthis is because these signs will\nsignificantly impact his risk reward\nassessment of transgressing that social\nnorm and guess what you're in control of\nthese signs"
