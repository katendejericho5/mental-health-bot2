    "transcript": "I once read an article I think it was in\nTime magazine or some a female author\nwas expressing her dumbfounded over why\nso many like presidents and magnates and\nsuccessful men cheat and it's like she\ntotally didn't get it it's like the men\nbecame successful in order not\nnecessarily to cheat but in order to\nhave access to more and more attractive\nreproductive opportunities and on some\nlevel that's why I often recommend that\nmen try to hold off making that\nlong-term commitment as late as possible\nbecause they're generally all things\nbeing equal unless they things up\nthey're going to have more and more\nattractive opportunities with women as\nthey age as they increase their status\ntheir Prestige and their wealth and then\nthey can make a determination as to I\ncan choose my best possible option or I\ncan enjoy my optionality just like those\nyoung women did when that man\npotentially 15 years ago asked that girl\nto be his girlfriend and she said no I'm\njust not ready to have a relationship\nyet it's kind of for the same reason\nyeah"
