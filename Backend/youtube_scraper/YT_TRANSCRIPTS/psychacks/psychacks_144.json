    "transcript": "now you might think well Orion what's\nthe problem with that what's the problem\nwith more new medicines to treat new\nproblems as we discover them and I would\nrespond are we discovering them or are\nwe creating them remember according to\nthe psychiatrists themselves there is no\nconclusive diagnostic assessment for any\none of their mental disorders so how can\nyou really prove that a drug is\neffective in treating a disorder when\nyou can't even prove that the disorder\nobjectively exists in the first place\nand if objective corroboration of any\nnew disorder is unnecessary then we're\nbasically now in the realm of metap\nphysics we're arguing functionally how\nmany angels can fit on the head of a pin\nit used to be two now it's 300 and I\nguarantee we'll find more ways to fit\neven more angels on that pin with each\npassing year because why not since their\nrelationship with objective reality is\ntenuous already we can continue to split\nthe categories even finer that way the\nnew conceptualizations can be\nmedicalized and a new pharmaceutical\nsolution for that conceptualization can\nbe brought to market after all it\ndoesn't really work if you sell the\nsolution and then create the problem\ndoes it"
