    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what most\npeople don't understand about mental\nillness the business of suffering so\nthis is the second part of a two-part\nepisode so be sure that you listen to\nthe first part first let's jump back in\nas I mentioned at the end of the first\nhalf the biggest issue associated with\nthe reification of mental disorders is\nthat it Fosters dependence on a\nprivileged class of Specialists who\nenjoy a monopoly on the indicated\ntreatment in the popular\nimagination okay what the heck does this\nmean now I'm a clinical psychologist\nthat means that I talk to people about\ntheir problems and advise them on\nSolutions on the level of their own\nself-experience this means for example I\nmight recommend say Activity scheduling\nor behavioral activation to\ninterventions within an individual's\ndomain of control associated with high\nrates of success for someone who comes\nin feeling depressed these are solutions\nthat the individual in question can even\ndo for himself much like a person who\nwants to lose weight can eat less and\nexercise more without necessarily hiring\na nutritionist or a personal trainer I\nmight help people get there faster than\nthey might otherwise on their own but\nI'm not necessarily doing anything that\nthey couldn't at least theoretically do\nfor\nthemselves however that's not how the\nmajority of mental illness is treated in\nthis country do you remember who writes\nthe DSM it's the American Psychiatric\nassociation now at this point you might\nreasonably ask but Orion why do\npsychologists and counselors and\ntherapists of all Stripes people who\nprimarily use Psychotherapy and human\nlevel solutions to address suffering in\nthe mind and in the heart why do these\npeople use the diagnostic categories and\nformulations of\npsychiatrists who are medical doctors\nand I would say that that is an\nexcellent question worth exploring in\ntoday's day and age there are a lot of\ndifferent degrees out there MD PhD Sid\nLCSW mft and many many others it's\ndifficult to navigate and even people in\nthe industry don't always know the\ndifferences here however for our present\npurposes let's just compare\npsychologists with\npsychiatrists they both have doctorates\nand are both the top of their respective\nfields in general psychiatrists can do\nanything that psychiatrist can do with\none important exception which serves as\nthe biggest practical difference between\nthese two professions namely a\npsychiatrist being a medical doctor can\nprescribe\nmedication that's kind of their Racket\nand they guard it very jealously because\nit's extremely lucrative to keep this\nparticular intervention monopolized\nunder their\ncontrol now if you have a human problem\nlike feeling down or on edge you might\nbe amenable to Human Solutions like like\ntalking about your problems or\ndisciplining your thoughts however if\ninstead you have a medical problem like\nmajor depressive disorder or generalized\nanxiety disorder you're going to need a\nmedical solution and the medical\nsolution that the psychiatric Community\nhas functionally decided upon is\npharmacotherapy pills if you hang around\na barber you're going to get a haircut\nby the same token if you go to see a\npsychiatrist you're probably going to\nleave with a prescription why it's kind\nof what they do and this is not an\nintervention that people can do for\nthemselves because the mechanism of\naction is kind of outside people's\ndomain of control and this creates a\ndependence on this class of Specialists\npeople need psychiatrists to treat\nmental illness in the same way that\npeople needed the church to perform\nexorcisms they're presumed to be the\nonly people with the Neary tools for the\njob all right so what does this have to\ndo with the reification of mental\nillness discussed in the first part of\nthis episode ever notice how there are\nmore and more mental illnesses with each\npassing addition of the DSM or what's\nmore how the thresholds of pre-existing\nillnesses continue to be lowered to\nincreasingly pathologize the normal\nrange of human emotion and behavior like\nfor example how it used to be the case\nthat someone couldn't be diagnosed with\nmajor depressive disorder if they were\ngrieving you know because feeling\ndepressed is a normal understandable\nhuman response the loss of an important\nrelationship but how the latest edition\nof the DSM removed this bereavement\nexclusion from the diagnosis of MDD ever\nnoticed how over the past few decades\nwe've radically overextended what\nconstitutes a mental disorder under the\nprevailing diagnostic\nconceptualization kind of strange don't\nyou think now\nI'm sure this has nothing to do with it\nbut psychiatrists decide what constitute\na medical disorder and psychiatrists\ntypically treat medical mental disorders\nwith pharmaceutical\nmedications now in order for the FDA to\napprove a psychiatric medication that\nnew medication needs to be demonstrated\neffective in treating the symptoms of a\nspecific disorder and if a particular\nmedication has already been approved for\nthat specific disorder the thresholds of\ndemonstrated Effectiveness for the new\nmedication are even higher than they\notherwise would be and this is certainly\nunfortunate from a business perspective\nbecause FDA approval of a new drug can\nresult in billions of dollars in new\nrevenue for pharmaceutical companies and\nthose who prescribe their products of\ncourse one way around that problem would\nbe to I don't know create a bunch of new\ndisorders that don't don't yet have FDA\napproved treatments as a way to keep the\nmoney\nflowing however despite the fact that it\nwould clearly be in their financial best\ninterest to do so and despite the fact\nthat given industry capture of certain\nRegulatory Agencies it would clearly be\nfeasible for them to pull this off I'm\nnot arguing that they actually do this\nas that would be extremely unethical and\ncorrupt wouldn't\nit I'm just noting that hypothetically\nit would be possible for this to occur\nnow you might think well Orion what's\nthe problem with that what's the problem\nwith more new medicines to treat new\nproblems as we discover them and I would\nrespond are we discovering them or are\nwe creating them remember according to\nthe psychiatrists themselves there is no\nconclusive diagnostic assessment for any\none of their mental disorders so how can\nyou really prove that a drug is\neffective in treating a disorder when\nyou can't even prove that the disorder\nobjectively exists in the first\nplace and if objective corroboration of\nany new disorder is\nunnecessary then we're basically now in\nthe realm of\nmetaphysics we're arguing functionally\nhow many angels can fit on the head of a\npin it used to be two now it's 300 and I\nguarantee we'll find more ways to fit\neven more angels on that pin with each\npassing year because why not since there\nwere relationship with objective reality\nis tenuous already we can continue to\nsplit the categories even finer that way\nthe new conceptualizations can be\nmedicalized and a new pharmaceutical\nsolution for that conceptualization can\nbe brought to market after all it\ndoesn't really work if you sell the\nsolution and then create the problem\ndoes\nit okay but what's the problem with\ngiving people who are suffering\nmedication Orion do you want them to\ncontinue to suffer of course not the\nproblem with doing this is that it\nlargely doesn't work which is to say\nthat at both the individual and\npopulation level these interventions\noften create more problems than they\nsolve if Pharmaceuticals conclusively\nimprove mental health outcomes that\nwould be one thing however the United\nStates has some of the worst mental\nhealth outcomes in the entire world not\njust in the industrialized world the\nentire world like Z babwe has better\noutcomes associated with schizophrenia\nthan the United States does and how much\nmore expensive is the American treatment\nthan the Zimbabwean treatment the\nAmerican public has largely been sold at\nbill of sale with respect to mental\nhealth treatment they pay more for Less\nto quote the National Library of\nMedicine the United States has some of\nthe worst mental health related outcomes\nin the world including the highest\nsuicide rate and the second highest drug\nrelated death rate and on some level we\nall know this after all if these\ninterventions were\neffective shouldn't we see fewer people\nwith mental illness kind of like how we\nsee fewer people with say measles\nfollowing the widespread use of the\nmeasles\nvaccine kind of makes you think now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth like this that really\nhelps to make the channel grow I'm also\nproud to announce that I'll soon be\npublishing my book the value of others\nso if you'd like to learn more about\nthat then you can go to my website and\nsign up for my Weekly Newsletter finally\nplease fill out an inquiry form on my\nwebsite if you're interested in booking\na paid consultation the link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to\nit as noted previously today one in four\npeople in the United States has a mental\nillness some of these are mild cases but\nmany of them are not like there's\nsomething called SSDI which is Social\nSecurity disability insurance which is a\ngovernment monthly stipend issued to\npeople who are so disabled that they\ncan't work according to the National\nInstitute of Health quote people with\npsychiatric impairments constitute the\nlargest and most rapidly growing\nsubgroup of Social Security Disability\nbeneficiaries in 1999 which I guess is\nthe most recent year for which\nstatistics are available which is kind\nof odd quote 34% of working adults\nreceiving SSI and 27% of s SSDI\nrecipients had a primary psychiatric\nimpairment this means that one in three\npeople who receive this kind of\nassistance are too anxious or depressed\nor Autistic or psychotic to work that's\nan enormous number and as the NIH\nreminds us it's rapidly\ngrowing but Orion isn't that number\ngrowing because it's catching up with\nthe true number of mentally ill that\nhave always been with us like it's not\nthat more people are actually mentally\nill today it's that we've increased our\nawareness of mental illness and improved\nour ability to screen it right now I've\nalready addressed the issues with\nspreading awareness in my episode\nunderstanding the symptom pool so I\nwon't repeat myself here so let's talk\nabout the screaming argument for a\nminute this can't be the reason behind\nthe recent explosion in the prevalence\nof mental illness why as we've discussed\nmultiple times there are no laboratory\nfindings that are diagnostic of any of\nthe disorders that have been identified\nand you can't screen something if you\ndon't have a reliable test for detecting\nit can you by screening what we actually\nmean is people coming in and filling out\nchecklists which can be interpreted in a\nlot of different ways let's look at the\ncriteria for ADHD again shall\nwe often fails to give close attention\nto details oh yeah absolutely sometimes\nI have to read something two or three\ntimes in order to attend to all of the\ndetailed information in the\ntext often has difficulty sustaining\nattention oh yeah my mind definitely\nwanders during those boring work\nmeetings often does not seem to listen\nwhen spoken to directly you know it I\nmean I forget people's names all the\ntime like as soon as they're told to me\nholy maybe I have ADHD I had no\nidea giving people who are already\nprimed to think that they may have\nsomething wrong with their attention a\nchecklist like this and you dramatically\nincrease the likelihood that they will\ninterpret the criteria in light of that\npriming and of course the standard\ntreatment for this issue is to change\npeople's brain chemistry now you might\nthink if brain chemistry were the issue\nwe would have objective laboratory\nevaluations capable of observing\nabnormal levels of brain chemicals\nbefore we prescribe the\nmedication but we don't so you'd be\nforgiven and it's certainly the case\nthat these medications do change the\nlevels of certain brain chemicals and\nthat the brain can become habituated to\nthese chemicals through repeated use and\nthis would mean that once habituated\npeople might have to continue to take\nthat medication\nindefinitely especially since in the\nabsence of objective assessment there\nwould be no clear indication that the\nissue has ever been effectively\nresolved and this is how people become\nlifetime consumers of psychiatric\nmedication and how do you think that\nwould impact outcomes our mental\nillnesses more or less prevalent among\nlifetime consumers of psychiatric\nmedication obviously that would be a\ncorrelation not a causation but it would\nbe interesting to note right what do you\nthink it would look like if millions of\npeople started changing their brain\nchemistry sometimes in irrevocable ways\nin order to solve problems that the\nprescribing doctors themselves cannot or\ncould not reliably link to brain\nchemistry might this have some\nrisks might this create more problems\nthan it\nsolves something to consider what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow as always I appreciate your\nsupport and thank you for listening and\nnow a word about\nStellar if you're interested in pursuing\na master's degree
