    "transcript": "in general we know that individually if\nyou control for all other things women\nwill select this quality over this other\nquality like in general if all of the\nthings are being every other part of a\nman's personality lifestyle and\npresentation are exactly the same and\none guy's significantly wealthier than\nthe other they're going to choose the\nwealthier guy because why not choose the\nwealthier guy if two guys are completely\nidentical in all other respects but one\nguy is 6'2 and the other guy is 5'4 why\nnot choose the 62 guy so we do know that\nthat women typically want men who are a\nlittle bit older who are stronger who\nare taller who make more money who are a\nhigher status who are more successful\nand are capable of inviting them into an\nemotionally compelling lifestyle that's\npart of what women are attracted to what\nthey want also depends on their goals\ncontrary to popular belief some women\njust want to and when they're looking\nfor that they prioritize a different\nsubset of qualities than when they're\nlooking to say get married and settle\ndown"
