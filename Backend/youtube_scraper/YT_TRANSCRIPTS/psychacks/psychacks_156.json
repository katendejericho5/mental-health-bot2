    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what most\npeople don't understand about mental\nillness the source of the problem so\nthis two-part episode isn't about women\nor relationships that's okay watch it\nanyway it may actually be more important\nfor you or someone you know to hear\nabout this so let's get to it right now\nabout one in four American adults are\nliving with mental illness that's 50\nmillion Americans suffering\nunnecessarily if you're shocked you're\nnot alone because it didn't used to be\nthis way these numbers have only gone up\nsignificantly in the past 40 years not\nonly is mental illness extremely\nexpensive both to the individuals\nthemselves and to society more broadly\nbut it creates an enormous existential\ntoll on the lives of countless others as\nwell how did it get to be this way and\nwhy is it getting worse to answer these\nquestions we have to understand the word\nreification reification comes from the\nLatin word re meaning thing so\nreification kind of means thingification\nit means to make a thing out of\nsomething that isn't actually a thing\nand if there's one word that will help\nus understand mental illness it is\nreification what does this mean this is\nthe the diagnostic and statistical\nManual of mental disorders published by\nthe American Psychiatric association now\nin its fifth edition it contains nearly\n300 different illnesses this is up from\nthe two mental illnesses first\nidentified by creolin in the early 20th\ncentury dementia precox which we might\nNow call schizophrenia and manic\ndepressive Insanity which we now call\nbipolar one Disorder so it would\ncertainly seem as though we've made\nmajor strides in the diagnosis of mental\nillness wouldn't it just like chemists\n200 years ago didn't know and couldn't\nknow that there were nearly 100 more\nelements out there Physicians a century\nago apparently had no idea that they\nwere missing no fewer than 300 different\nmental illnesses\nprogress but here's the\nthing none of these nearly 300 mental\nillnesses can be objectively\nassessed for all of these illnesses\ndiagnosis is primarily based on\nself-reported criteria checklists of\nsymptoms this means that you could book\na session with a doctor say you've had\nfive of these eight symptoms over the\npast month which has caused you a lot of\ndistress and boom you now have a mental\nillness the upshot of this is that in\nthe case of mental illness it's\nfunctionally the patient who decides\nwhether and to what extent he is is sick\ncan you imagine a medical system in\nwhich the patient tells the doctor that\nhe has strep throat or pancreatic cancer\nor brain aneurysm and that the doctor\nhas no way to objectively confirm that\nassessment and of course if there were\nno way to objectively confirm the\npresence of these diseases then there\nwould also be no way to objectively\nconfirm whether the diseases ever went\naway\nwith\nthere like pause this episode and\nbriefly consider what medicine would\nlook like if there were no way to trust\nto test the presence or the absence of\nany specific disease what do you think\nwould\nhappen well modern Psychiatry provides\nus with a potential vision of what that\nmight look like again there is no\ngenetic or physiological or\nneuroanatomical or neurochemical or\nradiological\nor any objective assessment for any one\nof these illnesses let's flip through\nthe pages and let the book speak for\nitself now shall we we can start with\nattention deficit hyperactivity disorder\nADHD that's one that people hear a lot\nabout right ADHD okay here we go\nAssociated laboratory findings there are\nno laboratory tests neurological\nassessments or attentional assessments\nthat have been established as Diagnostic\nin the clinical assessment of attention\ndeficit hyperactivity disorder\nhuh that's\nodd okay the book continues tests that\nrequire effortful mental processing have\nbeen noted to be abnormal in groups of\nindividuals with attention deficit\nhyperactivity disorder compared with\npeers oh really you don't say since\noften has trouble holding attention on\ntasks or you know trouble with effortful\nmental processing is one of the\nself-professed criteria for ADHD it it's\nhardly surprising that tests that\nrequire effortful mental functioning\nmight be abnormal in groups of\nindividuals already classified as having\ntrouble with effortful mental processing\nthis is because as I'm sure you can\nappreciate tests don't really have much\ndiagnostic\npotential if you run them on people who\nhave already been\ndiagnosed fortunately the book has the\nintellectual honesty to admit this\ncircular reasoning and goes on but the\ntests are not of demonstrated utility\nwhen one is trying to determine whether\na particular individual has the disorder\nit is not yet known what fundamental\ncognitive deficits are responsible for\nsuch group\ndifferences okay that's fascinating we\ncan't see ADHD on any scan test or\nassessment but no one today doubts that\nit\nexists whereas 40 years ago a boy might\nbe said to be restless probably over the\nprospect of being forced to sit still 8\nhours a day in arbitrary compliance to\nScholastic busy work of dubious import\nhe is today thought to be suffering from\nADHD that is\nreification now before we go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really helped\nto make the channel grow I'm also proud\nto announce that I'll soon be publishing\nmy book the value of other\nso if you'd like to learn more about\nthat then you can go to my website and\nsign up for my Weekly Newsletter finally\nplease fill out an inquiry form on my\nwebsite if you're interested in booking\na paid consultation link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to\nit all right but maybe that's just\nbecause ADHD is usually diagnosed in\nchildren who can't really advocate for\nthemselves effectively what about\nsomething like major depressive disorder\nthat that affects a lot of adults right\nokay here we go associate laboratory\nfindings no laboratory findings that are\ndiagnostic of a major depressive episode\nhave been\nidentified\nH that's weird I mean we give people\nchemicals to treat that Disorder so\nshouldn't we be able to see that the\nchemicals are out of whack before we\napplied the\nintervention guess not all right right\nbut that's probably because that's a\nmood disorder and everyone knows that\nmood is hazy and subjective right what\nabout schizophrenia H everyone knows\nthat that is the exception it's the gold\nstandard for the biological basis of\nmental illness genetics brain anatomy\nand all the rest here we go Associated\nlaboratory findings no laboratory\nfindings have been identified that are\ndiagnostic of\nschizophrenia okay all right so I'm not\ngoing to bore you by going through the\nother 297 disorders they're all more or\nless the same so are you saying that\nthese are fake problems Orion are you\nsaying that people are just making this\nup and lying about their suffering no\nI'm not while malingerers exist I\nbelieve the vast majority of people are\naccurately reporting their subjective\nexperience and that they are actually\nsuffering however I also believe that a\nlot of this suffering is\n[Music]\nunnecessary which is one way to approach\nNeurosis like my personal definition of\nneurosis is taking a fake problem into a\nreal problem which then absolutely\nbecomes a real problem for instance\nworrying about the straightness of your\npicture frames a fake problem while your\nhouse is on fire a real problem is\nactually a real problem both for the\nworrier and for the people around him\nnow it's actually hard to overstate the\nimportance of this issue as the\ninability to objectively diagnose mental\nillness opens the door to a lot of\npotential squirl one of the most\nimportant consequences is that it kind\nof makes the individual less responsible\nfor the problem he is suffering from and\nthis is kind of by design it was part of\nthe intention behind medicalizing mental\nillness it's cruel to hold people\nresponsible for things outside of their\ncontrol sometimes people might look\nstrange or act strange through no fault\nof their own however this does not\nnecessarily mean that they brought this\ncondition on themselves or that they can\ndo anything about it now that it's here\nso persecuting or ostracizing these\nindividuals just because they're\ndifferent is heartless and inhumane and\nit's a big part of why we've\ncollectively come so far from the stigan\ninsane asylums of the 19th\ncentury however most mental illnesses\nare not like congenital or genetically\ndetermined most of the symptoms that\nconstitute most mental illnesses are\nbrought on at least in part by the indiv\nidual themselves and these people\ngenerally can do something about them\nnow that they're here but reification\ncan obscure this responsibility for many\npeople they believe that being depressed\nor anxious is kind of like being\ncolorblind or congenitally diabetic\nthere's an issue inside of them that\nkind of has nothing to do with them that\nthey just kind of have to learn to live\nwith and you can see this understanding\nreflected in the language that people\nuse to describe these issues for\ninstance as you'll recall has trouble\nholding attention is one of the symptom\ncriteria of\nADHD so when someone tells me H you know\nI'm sorry Orion I'm having trouble\nconcentrating because of my\nADHD what I actually hear is H I'm sorry\nOrion I'm having trouble concentrating\nbecause of my trouble\nconcentrating right I mean after all as\nfar as we can tell the symptom is the\ndisorder so you can't really blame the\nsymptom\non anything other than itself but\nreification kind of creates a thing a\ndisorder inside of people that they can\nblame in lie of assuming personal\nresponsibility over at least that\nproportion of the variance of the issue\nthat resides within their domain of\ncontrol now maybe we do have this thing\ninside of us that for whatever reason we\njust can't see with all of our Advanced\nTechnologies like that's certainly\npossible I mean the strong nuclear force\nwasn't discovered until the 1930s and it\ncertainly existed before then so it's\nvery likely that we still can't see many\nthings that in the future will seem\nmanifest in obvious but right now we\ncan't but we act like we can and it's\nthis acting like that in my opinion is\ncreating a lot more problems than it's\nsolving and the biggest problem that\nit's creating is an inappropriate\ndependence on a privileged class of\nSpecialists who enjoy a monopoly on the\nindic at treatment I'll talk more about\nthis in the second part of this episode\nfor now what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and as
