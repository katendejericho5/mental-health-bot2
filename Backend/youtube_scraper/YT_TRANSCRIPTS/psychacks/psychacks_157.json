    "transcript": "that female chassity is something that\nis very ambivalently valued by men it is\nvery highly valued in a potential wife\nand it is a frustrating obstruction in a\npotential lover and women have to\nnavigate that confusing ambivalence that\nmen exhibit towards their chassity and\nso I I think it's like uh The Catch 22\nI'm talking about here is like if okay\nyou want let's say you're a woman and\nyou want to be Valu by a guy well like\nyou don't really have you need\nexperience right but then like if you\ngained experience with sex then like\nyou're also giving up your chassity\nright yes I think to be honest it might\nbe more important for men to have the\nexperience than for women to have the\nexperience but who are they going to\nhave the experiences with you understand\nYeah It's Tricky um this is because\nwomen tend to choose competent men over\nincompetent"
