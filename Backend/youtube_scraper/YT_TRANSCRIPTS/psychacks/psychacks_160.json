    "transcript": "when you think about I mean maybe the\nlast 20 30 years or so you know a lot\nmore women have been going into the the\nworkplace and they've been making equal\nor more money than men right which I\nthink is a great thing but there's also\na trade-off there there's a huge\ntrade-off which is I think that most\nwomen will only seriously consider a\nlong-term relationship if they stand if\nthey perceive that they will\nsignificantly benefit I think that if\nit's kind of a wash it's actually a loss\nbecause they foreclose on future\nopportunities that might be better and\nif it's not going to improve their life\nit's just like a automatic no-o for the\nvast majority of women but what that\nmeans as women become more successful\nboth in terms of their educational\nattainment and their income and their\nLifestyles it's harder for men to offer\nthem a significantly better offer and a\nlot of women I think understandably\nmight prefer to be single and\nunpartnered than to be partnered with a\nman that they perceive to be a liability"
