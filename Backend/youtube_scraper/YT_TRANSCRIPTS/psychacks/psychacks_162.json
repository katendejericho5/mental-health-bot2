    "transcript": "limitations make you better the easiest\nway I found to explain how this works is\nto talk about Batman Bruce Wayne the\nhandsome brooding billionaire and this\nguy can pretty much do what whatever he\nwants he's jacked he's rich and he puts\non a costume and flies around the city\nhe lives above the law which is a\nconscious choice on his part to do and\nwhich kind of puts him constantly at\nodds with the police but that's how he's\ndecided to live now Batman's Nemesis is\nJoker and despite their differences in\nappearance the two are actually fairly\nsimilar Joker also puts on a coste gy\nand flies around the city and lives\nabove the law as a conscious choice and\nJoker pretty much uses every opportunity\nhe can get to remind Batman of this fact\nand this is dangerous for Batman because\nwere he to cross a line a line that\nreally only exists because he drew it\nhimself his precarious relationship to\nself would crumble into chaos without\nthese rules he would be no different\nfrom Joker or rather he would be worse\nthan joker as he would be a\nself-righteous deluded hypocrite at\nleast Joker doesn't have any Illusions\nabout himself"
