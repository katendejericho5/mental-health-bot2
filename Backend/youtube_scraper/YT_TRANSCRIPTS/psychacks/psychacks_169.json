    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nlimitations make you better so this is a\nvery important subject for all men to\nconsider when I say limitations what I'm\ntalking about here is a self-imposed\nextrapolated ethical framework it's\nself-imposed because you got to do it\nyourself and it's extrapolated because\nyou really got to think it through and\nit's an ethical framework because it\ninforms how you make decisions As you\nmove through the world let me explain\nwhy this is going to be worth the\ntrouble for better or worse the vast\nmajority of men out there have not\nchosen to surrender to a specific\nphilosophical or religious framework in\na Catholic way I don't mean Catholic\nlike the Catholic Church Catholic means\nwhole so a Catholic framework is one in\nwhich all the doctrine is preserved\nwhole you don't pick and choose which\nrules you're going to follow and which\nrules you're going to ignore and it\ncould very well be the case that certain\nTraditions actually know more than you\ndo I mean some of them have thousands of\nyears of accumulated wisdom behind them\nand when you place yourself above them\nby picking and choosing then you will\nlikely deprive yourself of at least a\nportion of that knowledge in my opinion\nit's better to completely surrender to a\nframework for as long as you can and\nthen to leave the framework entirely\nwhen you can no longer do so for\nwhatever reason now without this ethical\nframework people are more or less just\nmaking it up as they go along and this\nmeans that every decision is\nfunctionally based on emotion and\nself-interest they like it so it's good\nthey don't like it so it's bad this is\nhow infants navigate reality however\nmany people have not matured past this\nstage because doing so takes effort and\ndiscipline and Clarity that said the\nconsequences of not doing this are\nconsiderable just look around modern\nlife is a constantly shifting chaos of\ninconsistency what is bad and wrong\ntoday might have been good and right\njust a year ago which is an absolutely\ninsane way of going through the world\nit's crazy making on the other hand an\nextrapolated ethical framework is like a\nNorth star it's something by which we\ncan navigate the ambiguities of everyday\nlife and if we're not going to surrender\nto an external framework in a Catholic\nmanner then in my opinion we have the\nethical duty to create that framework\nfor ourselves and it's all right if this\nframework is a chimera you can take\nsomething from the stoics and something\nfrom the Buddhists and something from\nthe Christians and something from the\nexistentialists and so on however\neventually you're going to want to\ncreate a system that you'll be willing\nand able to surrender to\nwholeheartedly and this will perforce\nrequire you to set limits on yourself\nlimitations are necessary they're like a\nskeleton which not only protects but\nfacilitates Locomotion as it allows us\nto move through the world with some\ndegree of confidence and equinity people\ndon't always like limits but there's\nreally no way around them now there are\ntwo really important ways in which the\nlimitations inherent in an ethical\nframework will help you out first this\nframework will help you not\nself-destruct once you become successful\nin many cases the limitations inherent\nin an ethical framework are less useful\nwhen you're not successful this is\nbecause the reality of your\ncircumstances already places limits on\nyour action there's kind of no need to\nuse an ethical principle to restrict\nBehavior if that behavior is already\nrestricted by scarcity it's one thing to\nmoralize about infidelity when nobody\nwants you for instance it's quite\nanother when hundreds of beautiful women\nare throwing themselves at you every day\nhowever it's important to consider how\nyou would want to live if you could\nactually do whatever you wanted and to\nstart practicing that way of life\ntoday why because we're going to start\noff by assuming that we're going to end\nup there one day like start with the end\nin mind right so if we assume that one\nday we will have enough success and\noptionality to functionally do whatever\nwe wanted and if we don't start putting\nlimitations on our actions now before we\nneed them then it's extremely unlikely\nthat we will be able to reign in our\nbehavior in the absence of the external\nrestrictions to which we have\neffectively delegated our\naccountability and this is a problem\nbecause our lives will likely go off the\nrails at that point and we won't be able\nto enjoy the fruits of all our extensive\nefforts just look at the rock stars and\nthe celebrities what tends to happen to\nthem when they arrive at the point where\nthey can functionally do whatever they\nwant self-destruct is not hyperbole it's\nvery easy to moralize about these\npeople's behavior but it's probably more\nuseful to assume that these people are\nreally no better or worse than you are\nwhile they may have an extraordinary\ntalent in some respects they may be very\nnormal in all other regards so their\nlives are often a testament to what\nhappens when Ordinary People attain to\nextraordinary power and influence\nwithout an extrapolated ethical\nframework start practicing within those\nlimitations\ntoday now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow I'm also proud to announce\nthat I'll soon be publishing my book the\nvalue of others so if you'd like to\nlearn more about that then you can go to\nmy website and sign up for my Weekly\nNewsletter finally please fill out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription all right let's get back to\nit now the second way in which the\nlimitations inherent in an ethical\nframework are important is that\nlimitations make you better so this is\nthe title of the episode right so how\nexactly does this work the easiest way I\nfound to explain how this works is to\ntalk about\nBatman so Batman is actually Bruce Wayne\nthe handsome brooding billionaire and\nthis guy can pretty much do what\nwhatever he wants he's jacked he's rich\nand he puts on a costume and flies\naround the city he lives above the law\nwhich is a conscious choice on his part\nto do and which kind of puts him\nconstantly at odds with the police but\nthat's how he's decided to live now\nBatman's Nemesis is Joker and despite\ntheir differences in appearance the two\nare actually fairly similar Joker also\nputs on a costume and flies around the\ncity and lives above the law as a\nconscious choice and Joker pretty much\nuses every opportunity he can get to\nremind Batman of this fact and this is\ndangerous for Batman because were he to\ncross a line a line that really only\nexists because he drew it himself and a\nline that no one could really hold him\naccountable for crossing anyway his\nprecarious relationship to self would\ncrumble into chaos so Batman has self\nimposed rules that separate him from\nJoker on one hand Batman doesn't have to\nhave these rules in the sense that no\none is forcing them on him but on the\nother hand he does otherwise the ethical\nbasis for his action in the world would\nflounder into incoherence without these\nrules he would be no different from\nJoker or rather he would be worse than\njoker as he would be a self-righteous\ndiluted hypocrite at least Joker doesn't\nhave any Illusions about himself in any\ncase Batman has a few Batman rules like\nhe doesn't use guns and he doesn't kill\npeople those are two of the rules that\nhe has chosen to operate by and he's\ngoing to hold himself accountable to\nthose rules because they help keep him\non this side of\nSanity that said these rules do create a\nliability for Batman why because due to\nthese self-imposed rules rules that\njoker has not imposed on himself it's\nnow actually easier for Joker to win\nthan it is for Batman to win Batman now\nhas fewer win conditions than Joker does\nfor example for Batman to win he needs\nto capture Joker without killing him\nhowever for Joker to win he could not\nonly capture Batman without killing him\nhe could just kill him or even more\nperversely provoke Batman into killing\nhim which paradoxically would allow\nJoker the ultimate moral victory over\nover Batman so there are more ways for\nJoker to win which all other things\nbeing equal increases the likelihood\nthat he will win this means that if\nBatman and Joker were exactly the same\nskill and power level Joker would win\nBatman wouldn't have a chance if the two\nwere evenly matched the victory would go\nto the one who could win more easily\nBatman understands this however and\nBatman's understanding of the\nliabilities created by his self-imposed\nlimitations force him to become more\nskilled and more powerful than he\notherwise would be this is because the\nonly chance Batman has of successfully\ncompeting with Joker under these\nconditions is to become significantly\nbetter than his enemy he must be\nstronger and smarter and tougher to\novercome his handicap and the kicker is\nthat he probably wouldn't have become\nbetter unless he needed to and it was\nprecisely his self-imposed limitations\nthat created the necessity for him to\nimprove so I encourage all you men out\nthere to Define your Batman rules what\nare the limitations that you are going\nto choose to apply to your own lives not\nbecause you need to not because you will\nbe punished if you don't but because you\nunderstand that applying these\nlimitations will force you to become\nbetter than you currently are\nhopefully that makes sense what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience
