    "transcript": "ladies you have to remember that for\nmany centuries women were actually the\nones who initiated the courtship process\nthey just did so in an indirect manner\nthat retained plausible deniability to\nprotect their honor in Victorian England\nfor example the stereotypical way a\nwoman used to do this was to\naccidentally drop her handkerchief in\nfront of the man she was interested in\ninitiating a conversation with this gave\nthe man aing reason to talk to her\nregardless of how attractive a woman is\nfew men are going to stop a woman out of\nthe blue and pick her up unless she\ngives him an invitation to do so so a\nwoman would provide him with that\ninvitation by dropping her handkerchief\nthat way he could pick it up and go oh\nExcuse Me Miss I believe you dropped\nthis and she could Giggle and say oh my\nhow terribly clumsy of me I'm ever so\ngrateful and boom she is now in a\nconversation"
