    "transcript": "I made an episode about this a long time\nago which is that Winners almost always\nquit the idea that Winners never quit is\nprobably Incorrect and it speaks to that\nkind of mental monologue that you were\ndescribing just a few minutes ago the\nfact of the matter is is that Mastery is\nvery very difficult to achieve and so\nanybody who actually succeeds in\narriving there must have quit pretty\nmuch everything else in their lives in\norder to devote themselves single\nfocused on this one Endeavor right so\nyou actually have to quit pretty much\neverything else in order to arrive at\nsome degree of Mastery now I think that\nonce you have some success you have some\nmoney you have built a business or you\ndevelop some sort of Fame it's almost\nlike you have a kitty that you can\ngamble with and so it's possible now to\ntake bigger risks without necessarily\ncompromising the fundamentals of your\nlifestyle or your survival"
