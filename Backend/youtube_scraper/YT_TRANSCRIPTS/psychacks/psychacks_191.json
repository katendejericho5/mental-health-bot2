    "transcript": "I'd like you to imagine that there is a\nshelf in your mind where you can put\nthings that you haven't made up your\nmind about yet like when you hear\nsomething when you take it inside of you\nyou don't immediately have to decide\nwhether you accept or reject whatever it\nis that you heard and this is fortunate\nbecause in the vast majority of cases\nthat decision will require deliberation\nresearch and consideration because let's\nbe honest you probably don't know much\nabout that issue like that's the default\nof all people at all times we don't know\nmuch about anything so most things if\nwe're being intellectually honest are\nthings that we're not yet prepared to\neither accept or reject they go on the\nshelf and people are skipping over all\nthat when they just decide to swallow\nthings uncritically or to spit things\nout the moment they come into contact\nwith them and that's because for a lot\nof people those are the only two options\nthat they know but I'm here to tell you\nthat there is a third option and that's\nthe cognitive Shelf"
