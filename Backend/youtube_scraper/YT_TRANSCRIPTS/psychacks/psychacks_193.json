    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nmarriage ultimatum so I've done a number\nof consultations with guys who are\nstruggling with this very issue the\nstory is always the same the man has\nbeen dating a woman for a certain amount\nof time and the woman feels that that\ntime has been sufficient for that man to\nhave made the decision as to whether or\nnot he's going to marry her and because\nshe feels the time has lapsed she begins\nto put more more emotional pressure on\nhim to enter into a legal arrangement\nwith her and she typically does this\neither through a combination of\nemotional manipulation tactics designed\nto induce shame guilt or fear in the man\nAndor creating difficulties by acting\nmore withdrawn or disagreeable and note\nto all you ladies out there neither of\nthese strategies is a particularly good\nidea with respect to your goals I'll do\nan episode on how men actually decide to\nget married very soon so stay tuned for\nthat in any case these men are generally\nlegitimately conflicted they clearly\ncare about the women in question and are\nnervous about the prospect of losing\nthem and they also have valid concerns\nabout radically changing the structure\nof their relationships concerns that all\ntoo often fall deaf on their women's\nears which does little to reassure them\nthese men are struggling and they don't\nknow what to do so I've created created\nan analogy to help them understand what\nthey're going through the analogy is\nthis at some point in his life\npractically every man has been in a\nsituation where he's dealing with a\nwoman he's not particularly attracted to\nand may not even like but he's dealing\nwith her because he's horny and he wants\nto have sex it is what it is now when\nguys are dealing with a woman like that\nthey tend to get more aggressive with\nrespect to securing the sexual encounter\nand the reason they do this is because\nthere isn't anything else they want from\nher to this man the woman in question\nisn't funny or charming so he doesn't\nfind her enjoyable to just have around\nand she isn't wise or intelligent so she\nisn't teaching him something that he's\ninterested in learning and she isn't\nuseful or helpful so she isn't\nfurthering his goals she's not any of\nthese things if she did provide other\nways in which he could meaningfully\nbenefit from the relationship then he\nmight be able to content himself without\nthe sexual element but in the absence of\nthese ways there's no reason for him to\nstick around and deal with that woman\nwithout sex he wants one thing because\nhe's not getting anything else that he\nwants and without that one thing there\nis no basis for further interaction and\nthat's what motivates men in these\ncircumstances to be more aggressive it's\nit's like hey I'm cool either way but if\nyou're not going to move things forward\nI can't really deal with you and I'm\ngoing to move on and that's a rational\ndecision given that man's perception of\nthe situation I get you fellas but\nhere's the thing what you do to a woman\nunder those circumstances is analogous\nto what a woman does to you when she's\npressuring you to marry\nher let that sink in if there were other\nways in which she felt she was\nbenefiting from that Arrangement if she\nwas content with your extrapolated\nlifestyle and the things you did\ntogether and the opportunities you\ncreate for her and the status she enjoys\nin relating to you and the good sex that\nyou consistently have and she could see\nno better\noptions that could give her more of what\nshe wants then she wouldn't be as pushy\nfor marriage this is because being pushy\nis a\nrisk sometimes when you rock the boat\nyou end up falling out this isn't always\na bad thing of course as it functionally\nforces the pushy person to move on to a\ndifferent relationship where she might\nstand a better chance of getting what\nshe wants but a woman is generally pushy\nfor marriage to the extent that she's\nnot getting anything else that she wants\nfrom that relationship and the real\nkicker here is that she might not be\ngetting anything else from the\nrelationship because you already gave it\nto her remember to want is to lack so if\nshe already has it she's not going to\nwant it so if marriage is the only thing\nyou haven't given her yet then what else\nis she G to want and if she's not\ngetting anything else to compensate her\nfor not getting the thing that she wants\nthen she's going to get more pushy it\nmakes sense now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nthen please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow I'm also\nproud to announce that I'll soon be\npublishing my book the value of others\nso if you'd like to learn more about\nthat you can go to my website and sign\nup for my newsletter finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're interested in booking a paid\nconsultation the link is in the\ndescription okay let's get back to it\nnow don't get me wrong a woman can want\nwhatever she wants and if she's not\ngetting what she wants then barring some\nother commitment to the contrary she has\nevery right to leave that Rel\nrelationship and move on but a woman who\nacts that way\nmen doesn't love you more than she loves\nwhat she\nwants Love's highest good is simply to\ncontinue to exist in the presence of the\nloved one that's it everything else\npales in comparison a woman who\nthreatens to leave you if you don't\nmarry her is functionally telling you\nthat she wants things more than she\nwants want to continue to be with\nyou she doesn't love you in this moment\nshe is looking to do business so don't\nconfuse the two the upshot is from the\nperspective of both men and women the\nmore someone is pushy the less you\nshould give them what they want like\nwomen don't have sex with guys who are\npushy about having sex with you they're\npushy to the extent that they don't want\nanything else from you because if they\ndid want something else and they were\ngetting it they wouldn't be so\naggressive by the same token men don't\nmarry women who are pushy about getting\nmarried they're pushy to the extent that\nthey don't want anything else from you\nbecause if they did want something else\nand they were getting it they wouldn't\nbe so\naggressive as I've discussed at length\nin another episode women treat men the\nway men treat jobs when a woman is pushy\nfrom Marriage she's functionally saying\nlook I've been in this role for two\nyears five years 10 years whatever and I\nwant a promotion and I want a promotion\nto permanent job\nsecurity if you do not give me said\npromotion I am going to go to a\ndifferent company and it's like fair\nenough ladies but men what you have to\nunderstand is that a woman who engages\nyou like this isn't coming from a place\nof Love she's coming from a place of\nmotivated self-interest she's looking to\ndo business which is after all precisely\nwhat a relationship is for so that's not\nnecessarily the problem what is\npotentially the problem is a woman who\nis assertively negotiating for something\nof great benefit to her without offering\nanything of great benefit in return\ndoing this is bad business and will\nlikely cause the woman to be rejected\nespecially if the man has any\noptionality to speak of men if she's\ngoing to do business then you got to do\nbusiness ask yourself what would I hope\nto get out of this what are the costs\nwhat are the risks are they sufficiently\noffset by the potential benefits I hope\nto acre from this situation and both\nsides need to remember that at this\npoint it's not personal it's just\nbusiness it's not personal if a woman\ndecides to lateral to a different\ncompany with a more attractive\ncompensation package after all it's much\neasier to remain loyal to one's\nperceived best interest and it's not\npersonal if a man decides that a certain\nemployee is better suited for a role as\nan independent contributor than as a\ncorporate officer after all people don't\nbecome the CEO simply due to\nseniority it also means that the people\nmen and women who are most likely to get\nwhat they want are the ones who seem not\nto want these things like the guy who\ndoesn't seem to care one way or the\nother if he has sex is way more likely\nto get laid than the guy who is pushing\naggressive for intercourse why because\nhis apparent indifference kind of makes\nthe sexual encounter feels safer for a\nwoman to\nproceed by the same token the woman who\ndoesn't seem to care one way or the\nother if she gets married is more likely\nto get married than the woman who is\npushy and aggressive for a ring why\nbecause her apparent indifference kind\nof makes matrimony feel safer for a man\nto proceed it's the same thing\nthe person who has more to lose needs to\nbe reassured needs to be made to feel\nsafe in order to proceed with sex the\nparty who has more to lose is the woman\nwith marriage the party who has more to\nlose is the man to the extent that men\nwant to marry women who love them men\nwill paradoxically be most motivated in\nmarrying women who do not seem to care\nabout whether or not they get married\nsomething to keep in mind ladies
