    "transcript": "is it better to be loved or to love I\nthink that it's a very good thing to\nlearn how to love I think that something\nthat every person would benefit from\nexperiencing but it is not what people\nthink it is love will turn you inside\nout it will destroy who you think you\nare in the same way that the Cocoon\ndestroys the caterpillar what happens in\nthere isn't pretty the caterpillar\nactually gets liquefied it's like a\nslurry in there for days or weeks to\nthat caterpillar the Cocoon repres is a\ntomb it does not have an understanding\nor a conceptualization of what a\nbutterfly is in my opinion goes in there\nto die without hope because the\ncaterpillar never emerges but what comes\nout of that is something that I think no\nentity that goes into the Cocoon can\npredict and once you make the decision\nto sacrifice your own happiness and\nwell-being voluntarily for the loved one\nyou find out who you really are you find\nout a lot about yourself because that's\nwhen the rubber really hits the road"
