    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nnot be part of the problem so if you\nlook around you will see that there are\na lot of issues facing the world today\nand that perception is subject to making\na lot of people upset however I am here\nto tell you in no uncertain terms that\nthe last thing the world needs is\nanother angry person\nnow I appreciate that some of you out\nthere may have heard that statement to\nmean Orion thinks that there's nothing\nin this world worth getting angry about\nand that means that Orion must be fine\nwith the way things are however Orion\ndid not say that and Orion didn't mean\nthose things what I said was the last\nthing the world needs is another angry\nperson stop like don't think past that\njust consider that one statement the\nlast thing the world needs is another\nangry\nperson are there issues in the world yes\nare there things to get angry about yes\nand are there many other ways of more\neffectively responding to those issues\nthan getting angry ABS\nlutely when you perceive the problems of\nthe world and you become angry usually\nimpotently angry because you are not\ngenerally taking constructive action in\nresponse to your subjective anger you\nactually become part of the problem one\nof the biggest problems facing the world\ntoday is this epidemic of anger and\noutrage on both sides it's destroying\npeople's Health it's destroying people's\nrelationships and it motivates people to\ndo all kinds of crazy irrational things\nit's a real problem now we don't want to\nbe part of the problem now do we we want\nto be part of the solution\nand one of the best ways that we can do\nthat is to maintain our emotional\nequilibrium so that we can work to solve\nproblems in a reality based way anger\ntypically isn't required and it\ngenerally situates people as part of the\nissue now a lot of this has to do with\nthe fact that in today's day and age\nit's like socially required to have the\ncorrect opinion about things one way or\nanother like in order to maintain your\nrelationships with your friends and your\nrelatives and your colleagues and your\ncommunities it has become increasingly\nnecessary to hold the correct read same\nopinion as those around you anyone who\ndoesn't is increasingly at risk of being\ncancelled or fired or cut off and this\nis crazy in these last few years I have\nseen people turn their backs on their\nlong-standing friends\nI've seen family members cut each other\nout of their lives I've seen companies\nfire hardworking employees not for\nabuse not for incompetence not for\nnegligence or corruption or criminality\nor any of the serious problems that\nunfortunately still exist in society\ntoday but because of a difference of\nopinion and that is\ninsane but that's where we are today\nthe necessity is not just to have an\nopinion but to have the correct read\nsame opinion as those around\nyou this necessity is directly\nresponsible for making Society more\npolarized and fragmented directly\nresponsible so how do we fix this to be\nhonest it's probably asking too much to\nencourage people to be more courageous\nand to maintain their positions\nirrespective of the social consequences\nthough that would certainly help to\nsolve the issue most people just aren't\ngoing to do that some people will most\npeople won't so I'm not going to\nrecommend that as a solution because a\nsolution that most people won't do isn't\nreally a solution so the solution I'm\ngoing to recommend instead is something\nI call the cognitive shelf so what is\nthat well before I Define that if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this

everything\nrunning thank you very much I will also\nsoon be starting a Weekly Newsletter so\nif you want to opt in you can do so on\nmy website let's get back to it okay I'd\nlike you to imagine that there is a\nshelf in your mind where you can put\nthings\nthat you haven't made up your mind about\nyet like when you hear something when\nyou take it inside of you you don't\nimmediately have to swallow it and you\ndon't immediately have to spit it out\nthat is you don't immediately have to\ndecide whether you accept or reject\nwhatever it is that you heard and this\nis fortunate because in the vast\nmajority of cases that decision will\nrequire deliberation research and\nconsideration and people are skipping\nover all that when they just decide to\nswallow things uncritically or to spit\nthings out the moment they come into\ncontact with them and that's because for\na lot of people those are the only two\noptions that they know but I'm here to\ntell you that there is a third option\nand that's the cognitive shelf so if\nyou've already heard something if you've\nalready put something inside of you and\nyou haven't yet decided whether you want\nto swallow it or spit it out you can\njust put it on this shelf in your mind\nfor for a while you acknowledge that it\nexists but you neither accept nor reject\nit people seem to have forgotten that it\nis okay not to have an opinion about\nsomething it is okay to defer having an\nopinion until you have sufficiently\nexamined the issue in fact it's kind of\nethically imperative that people do that\notherwise more likely than not they are\nadding to the\nproblem most people don't have a\ncognitive shelf like this is not\nsomething that is talked about socially\nmost people don't even know that it\nexists but I'm creating it inside of you\nby talking about it now now you know\nthat it exists and now you know that it\nexists inside of you and now you know\nthat this is another possibility for you\nwhen you're confronted with one of the\nmany extremely nuanced and complex\nissues that populate the world today\nbecause let's be honest\nyou probably don't know much about that\nissue like that's the default of all\npeople at all times we don't\nknow much about anything so most things\nif we're being intellectually honest are\nthings that we're not yet prepared to\neither accept or reject they go on the\nshelf and I think that this could be\npart of the solution because the social\nrisks associated with implementing the\ncognitive shelf are much lower than\nthose associated with say\nactively and courageously pushing back\non things and keep in mind that actively\nand courageously pushing back on things\nas a big group like in massive protest\nor exhibiting the acceptable outrage of\nthe moment aren't usually very\ncourageous courage is one against a 100\nit's not a 100 against one people will\nsay or do all kinds of bold things in a\ngroup that they wouldn't dream of saying\nor doing on their own\nthe true measure of Courage is taken\nwhen the individual engages the majority\nnot when the majority engages the\nindividual the former is courage the\nlatter is\nbullying that is why Mark Twain said\nwhenever you find yourself on the side\nof the majority it's time to pause and\nreflect in any case the cognitive shelf\nmight help to reduce the polarization of\nsociety which is making more and more\npeople angry which is turning the world\ninto one big powder kick ask yourself do\nyou think the world is better for people\nhaving become\nangrier do you think it's more peaceful\nis it safer are people healthier and\nhappier has quality of life gone up I\nmean to me the answers are obvious but\napparently the questions need to be\nasked something to consider or at least\nsomething to put on the\nShelf what do you think does this fit\nwith your experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd
