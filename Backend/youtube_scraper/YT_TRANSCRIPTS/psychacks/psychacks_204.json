    "transcript": "one of the things I often tell my\nclients is that as a therapist I\nfacilitate their disappointment by\nhelping them get what they want because\nonce a person is sufficiently\ndisappointed in some sort of external\nachievement there's one fewer place for\nthem to look for their own happiness and\nsatisfaction which is never found\noutside of themselves but unless they\nget that themselves they're going to\nthink I'm fullish it's like Rich\nHollywood movie star saying hey money\nisn't everything it's like yeah well it\ncertainly could help me I think I could\nhandle that problem or being famous\nisn't all it's cracked up to be it's\nlike you have to kind of you have to\nkind of learn that for yourself or else\nyou're going to think these people are\nhypocrites they're right but it takes a\nwhile to figure that out do you think\nthat there is a way to shortcut that\nrealization is there a way to realize\nthat climbing the mountain isn't what\nyou want to achieve without being stood\na top it first it requires accurate\nself- knowledge like the more that you\nknow who you truly are the more able you\nare to make decisions that represent\nlet's say goodness of fit between\nreality and yourself"
