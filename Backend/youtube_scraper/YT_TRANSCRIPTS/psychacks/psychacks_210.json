    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psychs\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nresponding to my female critics so as\nI've said in previous episodes the\noverwhelming response to my channel has\nbeen positive and I'm very appreciative\nand grateful for that however a very\nsmall percentage of the feedback that\nI've received has been quite negative\nand it always involves my discussions on\nintersexual Dynamics and even within\nthat space the thing that has gotten me\nthe most Flack is my discussion on\nwomen's optimal dating strategies within\nthe Contemporary sexual Marketplace I've\ndone a series on this topic on my\nchannel and I've spoken about these\nstrategies on some of my media\nappearances and even within that topic\nthe thing that has generated by far the\nmost vitriolic reaction is my advice\nthat women be the nastiest\nversions of themselves with the men they\nwant to have relationships with like\nthat one piece of advice is probably\nresponsible for 90% of my negative\nfeedback and because I'm authentically\ninterested in helping people and because\nthis seems to be an issue I want to use\nthis episode to respond to a few of the\nmore substantive pieces of criticism\nI've heard with respect to this piece of\nadvice and I Ed the term substantive\nbecause the vast majority of that\nfeedback was not substantive and does\nnot deserve to be discussed okay here we\ngo the first first thing you have to\nunderstand is that women have to be the\nnastiest versions of\nthemselves with\nsomebody like they have to that's the\nnature of superlatives so whether she's\nconsciously intending it or not the fact\nof the matter is that every woman will\nbe the nastiest version of\nthemselves with\nsomeone what I'm advising is that she be\nthe Nast version of herself\nwith the man she wants to have a\nrelationship with so if you're\ndisagreeing with that statement and you\nconcede that she has to be the nastiest\n version of herself with\nsomeone that means that you're\nfunctionally arguing that she should be\nthe nastiest version of\nherself with someone she doesn't want to\nbe in a relationship with and how\nexactly does that serve a woman's dating\ngoals like if she has to be the nastiest\n version of herself with\nsomebody why shouldn't she use that\nbehavior instrumentally and\nstrategically in order to secure a\nrelationship with a good Prospect\nbecause it will absolutely help her to\nsecure a relationship with that prospect\non the other hand encouraging the\nConverse that a woman should be the\nnasty as version of herself\nlike irrespective of whether she desires\na relationship with the man in question\nlike that's even than what I'm\nrecommending do you understand what I'm\nsaying so if it's\ninescapable that someone must benefit\nfrom that side of her why not have it be\nthe man with whom she desires a\nrelationship use that side strategically\nokay so that's the first piece of\nsubstantive criticism the second piece\ngoes a little something like this well\nOrion wouldn't following your advice\njust create this like slippery slope to\nthe bottom like if every woman has to be\nthe nastiest version of\nherself with every subsequent man she\nwants to have a relationship with\nwouldn't this just lead to women\nbecoming these like degraded sexual\nanimals now I have a couple of responses\nto this criticism in the first place\nlike I mentioned in the original episode\nthis advice doesn't necessarily have to\ndo with sex now obviously it could but\nif you're a young woman and all you've\never done is hold a boy's hand this\nadvice still applies because there are\nways of holding a boy's hand that\ncommunicate say platonic friendship and\nthere are ways of holding a boy's hand\nthat directly impart say a tantalizing\nsensuality in giving this advice I'm\ntrying to include as many of the\nstraight women in the sexual Marketplace\nas possible which includes young\ninexperienced women who may still be\nvirgins and I'm definitely not\nsuggesting that they just throw that\naway wanly all right now in the second\nplace there might be some truth to this\nobjection like if you follow this advice\nit does mean that with each subsequent\nattempt to secure a relationship a woman\nwill need to be at least as nasty and\n as the last attempt but here's\nthe thing between holding hands and like\nporn star sex 10 minutes into the first\ndate there is a\nlong long\ndistance you do not go from one to the\nother overnight so if that's what's\nhappening the issue is not with my\nadvice my advice is good the issue is\nwith the woman's discernment with\nrespect to the men to whom she is\nstrategically showing that side of\nherself because if the woman is in the\ndegraded porn star stage that probably\nmeans that she's implemented this\nstrategy incorrectly dozens if not\nhundreds of times so the problem is not\nthe strategy it's in the deployment so\nthat's the second piece of substantive\ncriticism now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and you can also tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this episode either through\nthe YouTube thanks button or directly\nthrough my website using the donation\nbutton I depend on your donations to\nmake all this happen I really really\nappreciate your support thank you I will\nalso soon be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so through my website okay let's\nget back to it now the third piece of\ncriticism kind of Dub tals with what I\nwas just saying which is that this\nadvice just doesn't work like if there\nare women who have implemented this\nadvice dozens or hundreds of times\ndoesn't that suggest the strategy was\nineffec in securing the\nrelationship good question what we have\nto understand is that in today's sexual\nMarketplace in which sex proceeds\ncommitment I'm sorry in which sex\nprecedes commitment but in which men\ncontinue to be The Gatekeepers of\ncommitment women generally have to use\nsex to secure commitment men are\ndefended against commitment in the same\nway that women are defended against sex\nlike women don't and shouldn't give sex\naway to every man who wants it by the\nsame token men don't and shouldn't just\ngive commitment away to every woman who\nwants it remember wanting is free it\ncosts nothing to want but it costs\nsomething to give and women providing\nsex is no longer sufficient to secure\ncommitment this is because in today's\nsexual Marketplace it is expected and\njust like women don't NE necessarily\nreward men just for doing what is\nexpected of them men don't necessarily\nreward women for the same it is what it\nis the point is just like women are\ndisincentivized from opening the gate of\nsex to everybody and anybody who wants\nit Men Are disincentivized from opening\nthe gate of commitment to anybody and\neverybody who wants that women what's\ngoing to open that gate is not you\nstanding outside declaring that you're\nlooking for a serious\nrelationship that is like a Salesman\nknocking on your door and saying Hey I\nwant to make some money here open up\nit's like yeah I get that but what's\nthat got to do with me both are entering\nthe interaction exclusively focused on\nwhat they want I want to make some money\nI want a committed relationship let me\nin like what are you talking about so\nhow does a Salesman actually get you to\nengage AG by offering something that the\nother person might want and with respect\nto relationships between men and women\nit's safe to assume that something the\nother person might want is sex if a\nwoman stands in front of a man's gate\nand instead offers a sexual opportunity\nit will significantly increase the\nlikelihood that he will open it up and\ninvite her in that's why I say this is\nthe Trojan Horse of getting a committed\nrelationship now that in itself is not\nenough to secure a relationship that's\nwhy I did a series on this topic it's\nnot just one thing but it is generally\nenough to get you through the door and\nyou have to get through the door in\norder to stay in the house now a lot of\nwomen are afraid of just being used for\na short-term sexual experience and then\ncast out but that does kind of mean that\nyou're further along like you have to be\nlet in first in order to be cast out and\nthis strategy is for women who have ulty\ngetting in with the men with whom they\nmost want to have relationships in order\nto stay in you need a different strategy\njust like it's presumptuous or entitled\nto assume that you should just be let in\nit's arrogant or cluess to think that\nyou need to do nothing to stay there\nthis is functionally equivalent to\nthinking that just because you went to\nthe interview you should get the job now\nin some markets attending the interview\nwill be sufficient however if you're in\na very competitive industry where\nthey're interviewing hundreds of\napplicants it's probably not enough just\nto show up to the interview you might\nhave to follow up and leverage your\nconnections and go above and beyond to\ndemonstrate that you're the most\ncompelling applicant for the position\nand if you don't it's like too bad so\nsad because the cost of winning is\noverpaying to beat your competition you\nhave to be willing to do things that\nthey won't you you have to understand\nthat from a professional standpoint if a\ncompany is interviewing a 100 applicants\nthe likelihood that the position will go\nto the most objectively deserving person\nis quite small obviously the position\nwill go to the one who checks the boxes\nbut there's probably going to be more\nthan one person in that cohort who\nchecks the boxes so the position will\nlikely go to the one in that smaller\nsubset that plays his or her cards right\nand the way to play your card right with\na man is after you get access to him by\ncommunicating a sexual opportunity to\nmake yourself\nuseful being useful is what will prevent\nyou from being cast out if you've been\nlet in and the higher the value of the\nman you're targeting the more you will\nlikely need to contend with competition\nto secure a relationship with him and\nyou win that position just like in\nbusiness by being willing to do what\nyour competition won't make sense I hope\nthat clears a few things up and I wish\nall the ladies out there happy Hunting\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith
