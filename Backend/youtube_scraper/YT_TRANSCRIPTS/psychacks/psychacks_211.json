    "transcript": "to feel confident before you have a\nstack of proof sometimes requires\nselectively turning off certain parts of\nyour mind and allowing other parts to\ncome to the Forefront and when I\nrecently explained this to a client in a\nconsultation he responded oh so you mean\nlie to yourself my response that push\nback was is it a lie or is it just not\ntrue yet like what temporal Horizon are\nyou operating under yes maybe you can't\ndo it in this exact moment but the\nself-doubt that thinks that may not be\nlooking at the bigger picture if you\nhave a compelling and extrapolated\nvision for your future and if you\nbelieve that over a long enough timeline\nyou will either find a way or make a way\nthen on some level you've already done\nthe thing you just haven't done it yet"
