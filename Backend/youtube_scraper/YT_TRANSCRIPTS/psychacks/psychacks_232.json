    "transcript": "so living your own life is something\nthat is actually very difficult to do\nthis is because doing so functionally\nrequires that you resist the pressure to\nconform to your culture's expectations\nof what your life is supposed to look\nlike there is a very clear Runway that\nyour culture maintains with respect to\nhow your relationships are supposed to\nproceed with respect to how your career\nis supposed to progress and with respect\nto how your family is supposed to behave\nand let me tell you those runways don't\nwork for a lot of people I mean just\nlook at marriage everyone knows that it\nfails more often than it succeeds and\nyet people continue to get married not\nonly that but if you tell people that\nyou're not interested in getting married\nthey'll look at you like you have two\nheads even if their own marriages are\nbroken and unhappy by the same token\nmost jobs are neither necessary nor\ninteresting nor rewarding they will also\nnever make you rich true Financial\nFreedom will never come from a job"
