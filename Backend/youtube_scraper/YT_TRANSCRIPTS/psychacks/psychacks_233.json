    "transcript": "many people want to know what causes\nrelationships to fail and the general\nconsensus is that relationships often\nfail because one partner kind of starts\nto deteriorate maybe this person stopped\nputting effort into the courtship or\ninto his or her appearance maybe this\nperson hasn't really Advanced his career\nor here her lifestyle or has fallen into\nhard financial Straits or maybe this\nperson has become depressed or addicted\nthere are lots of ways this can occur\nbut the idea here is that the\nrelationship fails when one partner\nfails or refuses to recover from some\nkind of setback and that can certainly\nbe the case however in my clinical\nexperience that's not what I usually see\nthere's this old joke it's not really a\njoke because it's not really funny but\nthe joke basically says that the fastest\nway to end a relationship is for one\npartner to start therapy and what's the\ngrain of Truth in this unfunny joke that\nrelationships are more effectively\ndestabilized not when one person starts\ndoing worse but when one person starts\ndoing better"
