    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the price\nof living your own life so living your\nown life is something that is actually\nvery difficult to do this is because\ndoing so functionally requires that you\nresist the pressure to conform to your\nculture's expectations of what your life\nis supposed to look like in my culture\nthis looks something like well first you\ngraduate high school and then you go to\ncollege and once you finish college you\ntry to land a good job and if you work\nreally hard at that job you will climb\nthe ladder and make a good salary and\nthis will allow you to buy a car and a\nnice house and a vacation in Hawaii of\ncourse while you're advancing your\ncareer you should also be looking for\nthat special someone after you date for\na while you should become exclusively\nmonogamous after a year of this you\nshould move in together and after a year\nof this you should get married and after\na year of this you should have kids\nyou'll go to church on Sundays and spend\nevery other Thanksgiving at your in-laws\nand encourage your kids to graduate high\nschool so they can go to college they\ncan get a good job Etc you understand\nwhat I'm saying this there is a very\nclear Runway that your culture maintains\nwith respect to how your relationships\nare supposed to proceed with respect to\nhow your career is supposed to progress\nand with respect to how your family is\nsupposed to behave and let me tell you\nthose runways don't work for a lot of\npeople I mean just look at marriage\neveryone knows that it fails more often\nthan it succeeds and yet people continue\nto get married not only that but if you\ntell people that you not interested in\ngetting married they'll look at you like\nyou have two heads even if their own\nmarriages are broken and unhappy by the\nsame token most jobs are neither\nnecessary nor interesting nor rewarding\nthey will also never make you rich true\nFinancial Freedom will never come from a\njob every day millions of people work\njobs that they literally hate so that\nthey can continue to earn enough to\nafford to live in a city to work a job\nthat they literally hate and this is\ncommon knowledge and yet people continue\nto get jobs not only that but if you\ntell people that you're interested in\nworking for yourself or becoming an\nentrepreneur they'll look at you like\nyou have a screw loose even if they are\ncounting the days to their own\nretirements the fact the matter is that\nthese structures are not going to work\nfor a lot of people if you actually want\na life that fits you that fits your\npreferences and your interests and your\npersonality and your temperament you're\ngoing to have to build it\nyourself because the only life that\ncould possibly fit you that well is\ngoing to be custom tailored for you just\nlike you can't expect clothes to really\nfit you if you just buy them off the\nrack you can't expect your life to\nreally work for you if you just follow\nyour cultures\nrecommendations that's the mental\nequivalent of shopping at Walmart it\nwill work to a point some of the time\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from this message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really helped to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I count on your support to make\nall this happen I really appreciate it I\nwill also soon be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so on my website finally if\nyou're thinking of going to grad school\nthen please check out my top rated GRE\nstudy program at Stellar g.com I wrote\nall the content myself it's the same\nstrategies that got me my perfect score\nI think you'll find\nit very excellent so let's get back to\nit so why don't more people live their\nown lives well there is a cost\nassociated with living your own life the\ncost is simple\nbut it's hard for a lot of people to pay\nhere it is the cost of living your own\nlife is the approval of\nothers that's it if you want to live\nyour own life you have to give up any\nclaim to social\napproval even though these cultures fail\npeople every single day people are very\nemotionally attached to them they've\nlargely dictated how their friends have\nlived their lives they've largely\ndictated how their relatives have lived\ntheir lives and they've largely dictated\nhow their neighbors and colleagues and\nfellow congregants live their lives as\nwell these people might not be able to\napprove of your choices because chances\nare they won't be able to understand\nthem and how can someone possibly\napprove of something that he doesn't\nunderstand but that's the reality the\nmore your life deviates from these\ncultural expectations the less your life\nbecomes comprehensible to others and and\nthis can be a very lonely situation\nwhat's more as soon as you start to say\nhey you know what that doesn't really\nwork for me and you start to take a\ndifferent path you run the risk of\ninciting the Envy of others because your\ncourage will reflect their own cowardice\nit will reflect the extent to which they\nhave given up on their own lives and\nthis generally does not make people feel\nvery good couple the incomprehensibility\nof your life with the vague negative\nfeeling they tend to experience in your\npresence and you have an easy recipe for\nhostility aggression and\nostracization which is why people who\nchoose their own paths in life are\nsubject to experiencing far more\npersecution and Injustice than those who\nconform even if their choices aren't\nharming\nanyone so it's important to understand\nthat the approval of others isn't just\nlike this warm fuzzy emotional\nvalidation it's a kind of social safety\nnet upon which those who do not conform\ncannot\nrely many people incorrectly believe\nthat it would be easy for them to forgo\nthe approval of others mostly because\nothers is still in this case an abstract\nentity it isn't anyone in particular\nit's harder when it's your dad or your\nwife or your children I don't care how\ncold and hard you think you are I\nguarantee there are some people in your\nlife that you would definitely prefer\nfor them to support you however the fact\nof the matter is that your friends might\nnot be able to do that your siblings\nmight not be able to do that your\nparents might not be able to do that\nwhen you start to live your own life\nyou're going to not be able to count on\nthe support and understanding of those\naround you and it's potentially going to\nfeel very\nlonely loneliness is a very difficult\nemotion for many people to tolerate and\nit's loneliness that often drives Those\nWho start to live their own own lives\nback into those conventional structures\nthey may not work but at least there are\nother people there I might be miserable\nbut at least I'll have company and we\ncan all kind of be miserable together\nand that's actually what a lot of the\nworld is a community of shared suffering\nit's not the only way to live but it's\nhow a lot of people live fortunately\nthough and let's end this on a high note\nthis doesn't have to last the issue is\nthat your family and your friends are\nlarge l ly in your life by accident like\nyou did not ask to be born into your\nfamily it was not your choice to be born\nto those parents at that time in that\nplace by the same token most of your\nfriends are accidental friends you all\nhappen to be born in the same general\ngeographical region at around the same\ntime and you struck up a relationship\nbecause you both happen to be I don't\nknow assigned to the same home room\nquestion how many of your friends would\nyou be friends with if you you met them\ntoday if you've actually allowed\nyourself to grow and change over the\npast 10 or 20 years probably not many of\nthem you both will have taken Divergent\npaths in life and your values now might\nbe very different now I'm not saying to\nbreak up with your old friends but to\nunderstand that there are some things\nthat old friends can give you and there\nare some things that old friends can't\ngive you and if you start to live your\nown life these friends might not be able\nto give you support and approval they\nmight be able to but they might not be\nable to and that's to be expected now\nthe good news is that once you start to\nlive your own life and you forgo the\napproval of others and your life\nactually begins to manifest you will\nattract other people into your life who\nresonate with that Vision other\npeople for whom your life is\nintelligible and comprehensible and then\nyou definitely won't be lonely in fact\nthis might be the only way to to ensure\nthat you are seen and understood by\nthose around you you just can't have it\nboth ways if you want to be approved by\nthe masses then you have to be\nunderstandable to the masses which means\nthat you cannot deviate from a\nconventional life on the other hand if\nyou want your own life if you want your\nown chance at happiness and wealth and\nfreedom then you have to be\nincomprehensible to the masses because\nif they still understand you you\nprobably haven't deviated enough to make\na difference what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel
