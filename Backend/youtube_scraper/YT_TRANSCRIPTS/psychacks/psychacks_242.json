    "transcript": "very few people are going to consciously\nthink to themselves I've decided to\nenter into a relationship with this\nperson because I believe it will be a\nnet gain for me in that the benefits I\nexpect to receive will significantly\nexceed the costs associated with\nacquiring them it sounds psychotic to\nverbalize but it accurately reflects\nwhat's going on beneath the surface so\nwhat happens in the vast majority of\ncases is that the final calculation gets\ntransmuted into a feeling for instance\nwhen this covert calculus predicts that\nthe value of a certain relationship is\ngoing to significantly exceed its costs\npeople don't think to themselves this is\na beneficial transaction for me they\nthink I'm pretty excited about this\nperson I think she might be a keeper on\nthe other hand when the calculus\npredicts that the value of a\nrelationship is not going to\nsignificantly exceed its costs people\ndon't think to themselves this is a wash\nand therefore a loss to me as it it is\npreventing me from entering into more\npersonally beneficial transactions they\nthink you know she's a she's a really\nnice girl but I feel like something is\nmissing"
