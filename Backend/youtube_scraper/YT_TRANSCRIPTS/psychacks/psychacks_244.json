    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why some\npeople get so upset with my content so\nthis episode was actually requested by\nmany of my followers following some of\nmy recent media appearances now I've\nbeen doing this now for about 3 years\nand I would say that the response to my\ncontent on the whole has been\nextremely positive like 99 9% positive\nwhich is a joy and an honor that said\nabout 1% of the feedback I received from\nfolks is extremely negative and this\nfeedback always pertains to my views on\nintersexual Dynamics and the game of\nmating and dating and today I'm going to\ndiscuss why this is the case in the\nfirst place it's important to appreciate\nthat virtually none of this negative\nfeedback is substantive like it almost\nnever pertains to any of my arguments\nrather it almost entirely consists of\ninsults defamation and AD homonym\nattacks which frankly is why it's\ndifficult to take this feedback\nseriously and why it doesn't really\nbother me to me there is no more obvious\nconfession that someone has lost an\nargument than resorting to ad homonyms\nthis is because if my attackers could\nPro prove me wrong I have to assume that\nthey would at least try to do so as that\nwould be a much greater victory for them\nso I just hear those attacks as\nDeclarations of surrender responding to\nthem at face value would be tant amount\nto kicking someone when they're down\nthat said they do constitute a\nfascinating phenomenon so what's really\ngoing on here what you have to\nunderstand is that most people aren't\nvery\nself-aware and a lot of what I talk\nabout actually takes place beneath the\nthreshold of awareness for instance it's\nabsolutely true that relationships are\nthe medium through which value is\ntransacted and that people tend to enter\ninto relationships where they most stand\nto gain or stand least to lose the issue\nis that the perception of value and gain\nand loss is actually dependent on a very\ncomplex covert calculus of which most\npeople are almost entirely unaware and\nthis calculus consists of an uncountable\nnumber of micro evaluations that\naccumulate into a judgment of\nattractiveness these evaluations occur\nin the context of your memory and past\nrelationships and in the context of your\ngoals and future plans and in the\ncontext of your own self-evaluation and\nself-image they predict whether another\nperson can give you what you want and if\nif they can whether they will be willing\nto give it to you they evaluate Global\npersonality traits like character and\nmore circumscribed attributes like\nloyalty or sexiness or sense of humor\nthat are weighted given their relative\nimportance and relevance to the\nevaluator and they also estimate the\ncosts the evaluator expects to incur in\nthe procurement and maintenance of the\nrelationship both in terms of the actual\nexpenditure of resources and in terms of\nforegone reproductive opportunities and\nall of this occurs beneath the threshold\nof awareness in large part very few\npeople very few people are going to\nconsciously think to themselves I've\ndecided to enter into a relationship\nwith this person because I believe it\nwill be a net gain for me in that the\nbenefits I expect to receive will\nsignificantly exceed the costs\nassociated with acquiring them like that\nsounds cold calculating and\ninhuman but if we were to pop the hood\nand examine the components of a person's\ndecision this is what we would find it\nsounds psychotic to verbalize but it\naccurately reflects what's going on\nbeneath the surface so what happens in\nthe vast majority of cases is that the\nfinal calculation gets transmuted into a\nfeeling for instance when this covert\ncalculus predicts that the value of a\ncertain relationship is going to\nsignificantly exceed its costs people\ndon't think to themselves this is a\nbeneficial transaction for me\nthey think I'm pretty excited about this\nperson she's great I think she might be\na keeper on the other hand when the\ncalculus predicts that the value of a\nrelationship is not going to\nsignificantly exceed its costs people\ndon't think to themselves this is a wash\nand there a loss to me as it it is\npreventing me from entering into more\npersonally beneficial\ntransactions they think you know she's a\nshe's a really nice girl but I feel like\nsomething is missing or\nI'm just not sure I guess I could make\nit work and of course when the calculus\npredicts that the costs of a\nrelationship will significantly exceed\nits value people don't think the\nbenefits I receive in this transaction\ndo not justify its expense they think\noh not if you were the last man on Earth\nor I think of us more as friends what\nhappens is that this value calculation\ngets transmuted into an emotion\nwhich motivates people to either\napproach and invest or withdraw and\navoid people are aware of this emotion\nbut not what aroused the emotion most of\nthe time that isn't an issue however if\nyou want to understand how people\nactually make decisions you have to hack\ninto this deeper process now before I go\nany further if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because its Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelped to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this episode I rely on\nyour support to make all this happen I\nreally appreciate it I will also soon be\nstarting a Weekly Newsletter so if you\nwant to opt in you can do so on my\nwebsite finally if you're thinking of\ngoing to grad school you need to check\nout my toprated GRE study program at\nStellar\ng.com okay let's get back to it now I\nguarantee I guarantee that people enter\ninto relationships with their perceived\nbest options like it wouldn't make sense\nto argue that people would forgo a\nbetter opportunity for a worse one our\ngenetic line would likely have stopped\nages ago if that were the case so if\npeople enter into relationships with\ntheir perceived best options then the\nperception of value is at the heart of\nwhy people enter into\nrelationships it's also sufficient to\nexplain a great deal of behavior\nespecially a great deal of the bad\nbehavior in the sexual Marketplace\neverything from divorce and monkey\nbranching to ghosting and\ninfidelity now the folks who are\ncritical of the economic model of\nrelationships they still make decisions\nevery day about who they spend their\ntime with and with whom they enter into\nrelationships and these decisions are\npredicated on the perception of value\nbut here's the thing many of the things\nthat people value are not socially\nacceptable\nor politically correct for instance\nthere are plenty of men who married the\nhottest woman they could get that's it\nthat was the primary\nCriterion and there are many women who\nmarried because they were afraid that\nthey'd end up alone if they didn't like\nthey didn't really like the guy or\ncertainly not love him they just were\nafraid and that's what motivated them to\nenter into that relationship so people\nhide these reasons almost always from\nother people but very often from\nthemselves a lot of people haven't done\nthe work to integrate the socially\nunacceptable parts of themselves\nespecially given our current topic of\ndiscussion their\nsuperficiality and their selfishness\nthey would like to believe that these\nparts don't exist inside of them which\njust isn't true however in the absence\nof integration they can really only deny\nand disavow these aspects of their\npersonality this makes it\nlikely uh that they won't come into\nemotional contact with these distressing\nparts of themselves but it doesn't\nactually neutralize the negativity which\nis really only possible through\nintegration Instead This disavowed\nnegativity gets projected onto other\npeople who are abstracted and\ndehumanized to facilitate the projection\nhence the adamms and the insults the\ntragic misunderstanding occurs when\npeople attempt to eradicate their own\nprojected negativity or Evil by\ndestroying the person on whom the\nnegativity or evil was projected such\npeople attempt to purge their own\ndarkness by cleansing the world of\nanything that reminds them of the\ndisavowed portions of\nthemselves of course this never ever\nWorks which is why this ignorance is\ndirectly responsible for a great deal of\nthe unnecessary pain and suffering that\nexists in this world and here's one\nfinal thought we can use the economic\nmodel to predict what demographic of\npeople is most likely to take issue with\nthe economic model think about it if\nrelationships ultimately are\ntransactional who do you think would be\nmost opposed to this knowledge becoming\nmore widely known qu Bono those who\ntypically benefit less from a mystified\ntransaction or those who typically\nbenefit\nmore without a doubt it would be those\nwho benefit more who would take issue\nand who typically benefits more from a\nrelationship according to the economic\nmodel women whereas women mate and date\nfor gain men must resign themselves to\nmate and date for acceptable loss\nhowever not all women benefit from\nrelationships equally what subsection of\nwomen typically benefits the most\naccording to the economic\nmodel older women older women are very\nvery expensive for instance a\n50-year-old woman no longer has any\ndirect reproductive value and she likely\nhas finished raising any children she\ndid have she will also have become\nsignificantly less attractive as a\nsexual partner as she ages many of the\ngoods for which men transacted their\ncommitment will have ended by this time\nhowever men are still expected to\nprovide Prov en visioning and resources\nand exclusive commitment to these women\nfor the rest of their lives you might\nargue that this is due recompense for\nwhat these women did in the past but\nthose men probably did a lot in the past\ntoo the upshot is that men are expected\nto pay the same price for a depreciating\nreproductive opportunity which\nfunctionally renders that opportunity\nincreasingly expensive as a function of\ntime so we can predict that the most\naggressive opposition to the economic\nmodel of relationships will come from\nolder women precisely because older\nwomen stand to lose the most if this\nidea were more widely known and if You\nobserve who responds most obstreperously\nto my ideas online you will find that\nthis is exactly what happens what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode
