    "video_title": "ACTING from a place of JEALOUSY is a LIABILITY",
    "transcript": "the issue however is that as soon as you\nstart to act from a place of jealousy\nwhich usually looks like contemptuous\ncritical or controlling Behavior what\nyou're effectively doing is\ncommunicating to your partner that you\nthink this other person is a better\noption for her and that might change her\nperception to align with yours I cannot\nstress this enough your woman might not\nsee a man as a better option until you\nstart to express jealousy about him\nthat's why it's not a good idea to plant\nthat idea in your woman's head which is\nwhat you essentially do when you start\nbehaving jealously this means that no\nmatter what even if you feel that hot\nevil feeling Rising inside of you you\nhave to put on your best poker face and\nexpress indifference to let's say casual\ninteractions"
