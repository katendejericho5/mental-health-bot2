    "transcript": "what's women's greatest enemy oh uh in\nthe context of sexual Marketplace it's\nPride everything that a woman wants in\nher relationship is probably on the\nother side of Pride so what does that\nmean this is especially relevant in the\ncontext of let's say ideological\nfeminism which says that that teaches\nwomen that they're just not supposed to\nbehave in this way relative to men and\nunfortunately a lot of the things that\nideological feminism prescribes are the\nthings that men most want from women in\nsexual relationships and so it makes it\nharder for those men who might\nbe authentically legitimately attractive\nto those women to transact that\nrelationship"
