    "transcript": "the fact of the matter is that many\npeople are depressed because of the\nactual state of their lives\nunfortunately the symptoms of depression\ncan keep people mired in this state much\nlonger than is necessary this is not\nonly because depression is unjustifiably\npessimistic or even hopeless about the\nfuture and so inappropriately assumes\nthat the way things are is the way\nthey're always going to be but because\ndepression is associated with behavioral\ninertia which makes constructive\nassertive effort to alter the\nunfavorable state of things less likely\nas well however I'm here to tell you\nthat moving up status hierarchies is one\nof the most reliable ways of becoming\nless depressed for the simple reason\nthat life doesn't suck quite so much\nwhen you're not at the bottom of the\nbarrel"
