    "transcript": "my working definition of the red pill is\na set of knowledge and knowhow that\nfacilitates the construction of a world\nviw that pertains to men's place in\nsociety and to intersexual Dynamics in\nparticular it's red pill in that this\nworldview deviates in significant ways\nfrom the dominant social narratives\nabout those topics I don't think that\nthe red pill is equivalent to male\nfeminism and I definitely don't see the\nred pill as anti-woman in fact believe\nthat many of the understandings in that\nknowledge set can and do substantially\nbenefit women in that they can enable\nwomen to have much more satisfying\nrelationships with the men of their\nchoosing so that's my working definition\nof the red pill"
