    "transcript": "this is going to be a hard pill for many\nmen to swallow but the fact of the\nmatter is that everything that you've\never done for a woman is\nirrelevant it does not matter if it's in\nthe past it's gone and this can be very\nfrustrating because some guys have done\na lot for their women they've taken them\nto Fiji and they've bought them a car\nand they've given them a ring and the\nhouse and the kids on their timeline\nthey have done a lot for their women and\nthese men often believe that what they\nhave done somehow in entitles them to\nsome measure of consideration love sex\nrespect or commitment now in the present\nmoment and unfortunately that's not true\nI'm sorry on some level I think this is\na failure of interex understanding the\nconception of reasonable entitlement is\nhow men think it's not necessarily how\nwomen think if the two of us were at a\nbar and you bought me around the next\ntime you needed a drink I would buy you\naround why because I would feel in some\nsmall way as if I were in your debt"
