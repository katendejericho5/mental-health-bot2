    "transcript": "most women don't show up on a date\nthinking or expecting that they're going\nto go back to a guy's house and have sex\nand yet that happens every like all the\ntime right why because that guy had a\nplan that guy had some game and that guy\nwas moving interaction in the direction\nof that kind of relationship the same\nthing happens for the committed\nrelationships that women want they don't\njust happen they happen because a woman\nhad a plan she had some game and she was\nguiding the relationship in the\ndirection of that kind of encounter very\nfew guys are going to give that\nvoluntarily just like very few women are\njust handing out sex to guys just\nbecause they want it wanting is free it\ncost nothing to want things my wanting\nsex from women has never persuaded any\nsingle woman to give it to me why would\na woman wanting commitment or marriage\nor exclusivity or Etc why should that\nmotivate me in and of itself to give\nthat to her like there has to be some\nback and forth there has to be some\nstrategy and there has to be some uh the\nvalue proposition has to make sense"
