    "transcript": "accurate reflection is such an\nunderrated communication tactic\nespecially if you're looking to\ndeescalate an emotionally charged\nsituation when people don't feel heard\nthey get louder and more aggressive on\nthe other hand when people do feel heard\nthey tend to get quieter and more\nreasonable so what does this look like\nwell if your woman were to say you don't\nlove me one effective response might be\nto say something like you feel that I\ndon't love you that's it she might then\nsay yeah because you never help out\naround the house and you can then\nrespond you think I don't help out\naround the house like Don't Be Clever\nkeep it that simple three or four of\nthese exchanges are enough to take the\nheat out of almost any interaction and\nkeep in mind that reflection is not\nagreement it's not approval and it's not\na commitment all you're basically doing\nwith reflection is communicating message\nreceived and this works because people\ngenerally don't persist in sending\nduplicate messages"
