    "transcript": "I don't believe it's possible to\ncompletely refrain from projecting our\njudgments or mental constructs into\nreality but I absolutely believe that\nit's possible to let's say withhold\ncertain judgments and clarify others\nthat is we can divest them of their\nemotionally provocative content and\nthat's typically a sign that we're\ncloser to reality because again reality\nis what it is it's kind of hard to feel\none way or another about reality the\nmore we see it clearly I can't really\nsay anything more about reality because\ngoing beyond that is tantamount to\nimbuing it with my own projected\njudgment and this is why Enlightenment\nwhich may be understood as entering into\nreality is always described as an\nineffable experience it's something that\neven the greatest spiritual Traditions\ncan kind of only point to from afar"
