    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nkeep your cool with women so this is\nwhat I call an emotional survival tactic\nit will get you through the toughest\nmoments of a disagreeable interaction\nwith a woman relatively\nunscathed now one of the obvious reasons\nwhy people hurt the ones they love is\nthat they have access to their\nvulnerabilities almost every man has had\nthe experience of something he shared\nwith his woman in trust and confidence\nbeing used against him in a quarrel\nmonths even years later I call this\nweaponized intimacy and it is done to\ninflict a concentrated amount of\nemotional pain for a variety of reasons\nwomen's attacks can also take the form\nof hurtful and untrue statements things\nlike you don't love me or I hate you or\nyou never cared for me at all\nEtc now leaving aside the entire\nquestion as to why you're in a\nrelationship with a disrespectful woman\nwho talks to you in this way which has\nbeen the subject of other\nepisodes this episode is about how to\nget through this particular moment when\na woman is personally attacking you\nwithout making your situation any worse\nthan it already is this is because if\nyou the man get suckered into her anger\nit's probably not going to end well for\nyou not only do you surrender your\nemotional control and become\ndisregulated which is not a very\npleasant experience you are much more\nlikely to say and do things in Anger\nthat you might ultimately regret and\ntheir consequences might long outlive\nthis particular unpleasant\ninteraction so when you're dealing with\nan actively hostile woman the first rule\nof thumb is to not make your situation\neven worse\nand guys often make the situation even\nworse by becoming\ndefensive defensiveness is tricky\nbecause it basically acknowledges the\nreality of a valid attack so it kind of\nadmits that there is at least some\ndegree of Truth to what she is saying\nthat must therefore be responded to so\ndefensiveness unfortunately tends to\nvalidate the perspective of the attacker\nwhich generally\nemboldens attackers for example if a\nwoman says something like you don't love\nme most men will start listing out\ncounterfactuals that disprove the\nassertion like what are you talking\nabout I gave you the ring the house the\ncar I put up with your parents every\nThanksgiving and I took you to the\nBahamas just last month how could you\npossibly think that so men who do this\nare functionally trying to prove their\ninnocence which of course is only really\nnecessary in the face of a grounded\naccusation just like how running away\nfrom certain animals triggers their\nPredator Instinct and they will come to\nsee you as prey as a result becoming\ndefensive in response to others\naccusations triggers their aggression\nwhich can create a nasty positive\nfeedback loop so rather than become\ndefensive men need to learn to keep\ntheir cool with women and I'm going to\nshare with you how I've been able to do\nthis albeit imperfectly I can tell you\nthat this emotional survival tactic has\nsaved my life and it might even save\nyour life one day as well I guarantee\nthat you can perform this tactic right\nnow as you are with no special training\nnecessary here it is no matter what\nwoman you're dealing with a and no\nmatter what a woman tells you to you to\nthe extent that she becomes\nemotional you need to mentally create a\nverbal sandwich around her words that\nmeans you're going to add something to\nthe beginning of what she says and add\nsomething to the end of what she says\nwe'll do the beginning part first and\nthe end part second but before we go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nvideo to someone who might benefit from\nits message because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really helped\nmake the channel grow\nyou can also hit the thanks button and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nfeel you've derived from this episode I\nrely on your support to make all of this\nhappen I really appreciate it I will\nalso soon be starting a Weekly\nNewsletter so if you want to opt in you\ncan do so on my website and if you're\nthinking of going to grad school check\nout my toprated gr self-study program at\nStellar\ng.com okay let's get to it\nthe first thing that you have to\nmentally append to the beginning of a\nwoman's statements are the words I\nfeel I feel no matter what she says you\nneed to mentally put the words I feel at\nthe beginning you don't love me which is\nprobably not an accurate statement and\nmotivates men to correct this inaccuracy\nthrough defensiveness becomes I feel you\ndon't love me\nwhich could very well be a true\nstatement that accurately reflects her\nemotional reality you're a terrible\nperson becomes I feel you're a terrible\nperson I hate you becomes I feel I hate\nyou which though hard to hear emphasizes\nthe transient nature of the hate Etc and\nof course this is very likely what she\nis actually attempting to say however\npeople in general become less effective\ncommunicators when they become emotional\nand they tend to leave those parts out\nthe point is that by adding these words\nit's easier to remember that you're not\nactually dealing with a personal attack\nbut a confession of her emotional state\nand you can't really argue with that\nlike that is how she feels which means\nthat it's completely true that she feels\nthat you don't love her or that she\nfeels that you're a terrible person Etc\nand really what is the point in arguing\nabout something that is obviously true\nremembering that this uncomfortable\nmoment is actually a confession of her\nemotional state and is therefore a true\nreflection of her feelings can help you\nnot get bent out of shape in that moment\nwhat's\nmore like what's it to you like she has\na right to feel whatever she wants to\nfeel she's a full-grown adult if she\nwants to feel angry and vindictive and\nhateful that's her right I mean I I\nwouldn't choose those things for myself\nI don't prefer to feel that way but if a\nwoman wants to feel those things for\nsome reason I'm not going to stop her if\nfor no other reason that I'm not\ninterested in assuming responsibility\nfor how another grown adult feels like\nI'll be responsible for me because I\nalone am in a position to respond to the\nprecursors of my emotions and you'll be\nresponsible for you of course if those\nfeelings give way to angry vindictive\nand hateful Behavior that's another\nstory but if she wants to feel those\nunpleasant emotions then let her you\ncan't really stop her anyway in any case\nappending the words I feel to her words\nwill help you to remember that you're\ndealing with an emotional confession as\nopposed to say a declaration about\nreality all right and what about the\nsecond part of the sandwich the other\nslice of bread that you mentally append\nto the end of whatever she says are the\nwords right\nnow right now and this makes sense\nbecause if you're dealing with an\nemotional confession well those feelings\nare going to change maybe in as little\nas an hour or two they're going to be\ncompletely different this means that you\ndon't necessarily have to understand\nwhat she's saying to be an objective\nobservation of a reality that is\npermanent and endar enduring definitely\nnot endearing a reality that's permanent\nand\nenduring you don't love me becomes I\nfeel that you don't love me right now I\nhate you becomes I feel that I hate you\nright now you're a terrible person\nbecomes I feel that you're a terrible\nperson right now appending these words\nat the end of what she says will help\nyou remember that you're dealing with an\nephemeral phenomenon so you don't\nnecessarily have to do anything or say\nanything to keep that necessarily\ntransitory emotion state in existence\nlonger than it absolutely needs to be\nand you will absolutely increase its\nlifespan if you choose to engage with it\nin kind and at face\nvalue and how can you escape this\nuncomfortable situation even more\nquickly than non-engagement I'm so happy\nyou asked the answer is accurate\nreflection accurate reflection is such\nan underrated communication tactic\nespecially if you're looking to\ndeescalate\nan emotionally charged situation when\npeople don't feel heard they get louder\nand more\naggressive on the other hand when people\ndo feel heard they tend to get quieter\nand more reasonable so what does this\nlook like well if your woman were to say\nyou don't love me one effective response\nmight be to say something like you feel\nthat I don't love\nyou that's it she might then say yeah\nbecause you never help out around the\nhouse and you can then respond you think\nI don't help out around the\nhouse like Don't Be Clever keep it that\nsimple three or four of these exchanges\nare enough to take the heat out of\nalmost any interaction and keep in mind\nthat reflection is not agreement it's\nnot approval and it's not a commitment\nall you're basically doing with\nreflection is communicating message\nreceived and this works because people\ngenerally don't persist in sending\nduplicate messages now once the emotion\nis gone you might want to consider\ndiscussing what happened and addressing\nany underlying issues but now is not the\ntime to do that for the time being just\nfocus on getting out of this escalating\nexchange and o one final note it's\nactually also important for men to\nappend these words to women's positive\nemotionality as well well this is going\nto hurt but when a woman says I love you\nor you're the most amazing man I've ever\nmet you need to add the sandwich I love\nyou becomes I feel I love you right now\nyou're the most amazing man I've ever\nmet becomes I feel you're the most\namazing man I've ever met right\nnow I understand that this might be hard\nto hear but mentally adding these words\nto the beginning and end of a woman's\nemotional statements will help you keep\nyour feet firmly planted on the ground\nwhere they\nbelong this will allow you to assess the\nreality of the claim and wait its\nsignificance\nappropriately what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel
