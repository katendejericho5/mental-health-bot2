    "transcript": "a lot of modern women are in this trap\nwhere some of the behavior that might\nwork to get them the kind of\nrelationship they want from the men they\nwant to have that relationship with is\nfrowned upon by their fellow woman it's\nbasically the equivalent of sing in men\nand the equivalent of sing in men for\nwomen is anything that has to do with\nlet's say traditional reactionary\nfeminine behavior that I am going to be\nsubmissive for a man that I am going to\nwait for him that's how it used to be\nthe idea that I'm going to serve a man\nor make his life easier or do any kind\nof domestic help all of these things\nwould be seen as almost a betrayal of\nher gender at this point and so even\nthough those behaviors might\ninstrumentally help her get the kind of\nrelationship she wants with the man she\nwants to have that relationship with it\nwould come at the cost of let's say the\nrespect of the women that she's\ncompeting against in her own intersexual\nstatus games"
