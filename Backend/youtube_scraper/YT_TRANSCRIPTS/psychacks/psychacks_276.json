    "transcript": "if you want to save your mind if you\nwant to go through the timeconsuming\nprocess of actually becoming an\nindividual you need to go through the\nvery personal and very challenging\nprocess of carefully examining the\ncontents of your Consciousness and be\nwilling to divest yourself of that which\nis no longer true and or useful you want\nto simplify and clarify your mind as\nmuch as you want to simplify and clarify\nyour actual living space this could take\nyears however over time little by little\nyou may arrive at a point in which the\nmajority of your mind's contents is\nthere with your conscious permission and\nat your conscious pleasure this is long\nlaborious work but there is no way\naround it fortunately the more you do\nthis the better you get at assessing\nthings accurately and the easier it\nbecomes to discard things that no longer\nserve you"
