    "transcript": "as women increasingly have better\neducational outcomes as they begin to\nout earn men as they occupy more\npositions of power and authority they\nwill naturally encounter a smaller and\nsmaller dating pool from which to select\nappropriate men the alternative is to\nresign themselves to a relationship with\na lower status man and if she is higher\nvalue than he is that will likely mean\nthat the transaction of value and\nresources will generally flow from her\nto him and many women consider this\nscenario and they think what fck am I\ngetting out of this situation I provide\nthe money and the lifestyle and the\nresponsibility what am I getting for my\ntime energy and money how does this help\nme I'd rather just be single or pay a\nsurate to have my baby and hearing a\nwoman talk like this warms the cockles\nof my heart because once she finishes\nventing her spleen I typically hit her\nwith a line that never fails to make her\njaw drop and that line is welcome to\nbeing a man"
