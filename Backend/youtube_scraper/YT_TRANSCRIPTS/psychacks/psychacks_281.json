    "transcript": "many people actually don't want to know\nthe truth because if they knew the truth\nthey might have to actually do something\nabout it which Beyond just requiring\neffort might very well be painful and\ndiscomforting besides and this is why\npeople who start telling the truth are\nalmost universally punished by their\ncommunities to begin with the truth\ncreates a necessity for change which is\nuncomfortable and expensive and\npotentially something no one else asked\nfor the truth might also require giving\nup certain benefits or privileges that\ninhere in the status quo this often\nproduces a kind of implied understanding\nbetween the people in the relationship\nnamely I'm not really going to show up\nor ask about your truth and you're not\nreally going to show up or ask about my\ntruth and we're both going to pretend\nthat neither one of us knows about\neither one of us knowing about this\narrangement"
