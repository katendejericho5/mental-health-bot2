    "transcript": "hello everyone thank you for joining me\ntoday I'm Dr Orion taban and I am very\npleased to be able to sit down today\nwith Dr Robert Glover the author of No\nMore Mr Nice Guy I have my own copy\nright here hey man that's a nice looking\nbook you got there yeah man I actually\nthis is one of the first books I read\nmaybe 10 years ago when I started on my\njourney of self-awareness to uh to level\nup in both my romantic and social life\nso uh thank you for your work it's meant\na lot to me personally I know it's\nhelped a lot of guys uh all over the\nworld so I'm I'm personally excited to\nhave you on and I think it's a great fit\nfor the channel so welcome well thanks\nfor the invitation it's good to be here\nand uh let's have fun let's do it now I\nassume that a lot of my audience is\ngoing to be familiar with your work but\njust so that we get all on the same page\ntell me what is a nice guy and what's so\nbad about it I was so bad about it all\nright a nice guys basically is a guy who\ndoesn't believe he's just okay as he is\nand this is an an emotionally\ninternalized belief usually dating back\nto Early Childhood where he believes he\nhas to become what he thinks other\npeople want him to be to be liked and\nloved and get his needs met and hide\nanything about himself that might cause\nanybody to have a negative\nreaction I see okay that's interesting\nbecause one of the episodes I made a\nwhile back is called most men are\nRomantics and I talk about how the most\nprevalent male romantic belief is I\nshould be loved just for who I am and\nthat might sound like it runs a little\ncounter to what you just described and\ndo you do you have a comment about that\nwe could I could go a couple directions\nwith that I should be loved just as I am\nhere's the\ndeal we'll start something off here we\ncan run with this uh ways I'm sure I\ndon't believe Love's ever found\nexternally that's part of the problem is\nthat we believe if I want to be loved I\ngot to go find it somewhere else and and\nyou know culturally you know women are\ntaught you go get it from a guy and guys\nare taught you go get that from a woman\nyou know and and you know unless unless\nwe're not heterosexual and then just you\nknow shift it to whatever our opposite\nsex\nis but I think it is probably one of the\ngreatest causes of human suffering that\nwe go looking for love outside of oursel\nbecause I don't know about you in my\nexperience I've never been consistently\nloved by even the people who claim to\nlove me and you know I I can piss them\noff they can fall out of love with me\nand\nso anytime we go searching for love\noutside\nourself we're asking for difficulty and\nproblem I think that's why so many\nrelationships don't work we go into them\nwith this illusion oh this person likes\nme and wants to be with me I Finally\nFound Love they're going to love me\nforever and everything's going to be\ngreat now here's another problem if we\ndon't already internally feel\nparticularly lovable here's a couple of\nproblems we won't let anybody love us\nmore than we already love oursel\nwhatever if we put that on a scale of\none to 10 I love myself as six well\nthat's as much as we ever let anybody\nlove us is it it is six because we won't\nbelieve anybody could love us more than\nwhat we love ourselves most of us\nprobably don't love ourselves at a six\nthe second problem is we can't love\nanybody else more than we love ourselves\nit's it's just impossible to be more\nloving to others than you are to you now\nwe may give more to other people we may\nyou know create a codependent\nrelationship with other people but\nthat's not love that's that's that's\nborrow functioning that's giving to get\nthat's manipulation that's I'll give to\nyou so that you'll love me it's the it's\nthe covert contracts I talk about and No\nMore Mr Nice Guy so there's I think that\nthe issue that we got to start with is\nhow do we learn to love oursel and see\nourself as love and if we don't believe\nwe're lovable we're not going to let\npeople love us and we're not going to\nlet people see the real us which that's\nactually how people kind of get a chance\nto love us as they see the real us and\nagain we won't love anybody more than we\nlove ourselves and the people around us\nwill go you know how come I don't feel\nall that loved by you well we only love\nyou\nknow I I used to be religious I have two\ndegrees in religion so without going\ndown that road you know it's interesting\nyou know we've all heard about kind of\nthe Golden Rule and and Jesus Sermon on\nthe Mount where he said love your\nneighbor as yourself and we say that a\nlot but I don't think we ever actually\npull that apart and say what is the\nstandard of love for others your\nneighbors referring to anybody out there\nwhen he said love your neighbor as\nyourself he said selflove is the\nstandard of all love and he just said\nthat like everybody's going to\nunderstand that it'll make sense but\nhere we're talking about well how do we\nget other people to love us you don't\nyou love you and my experience is the\nmore you love you the more you tend to\nattract people who act loving towards\nyou now I can get behind everything that\nyou just said in fact I made an episode\na long time ago about the Golden Rule\nand suggested that another way to\ninterpret that is less a commandment for\nmoral action and more an observation on\nreality with an implied subject as in\nlove your neighbor as you love yourself\ncould also be interpreted as you love\nyour neighbor as you love yourself\nthat's just the the reality of the\nsituation and and it could also be love\nyourself it could be um so I I agree\nwith all of that I also had a mentor\ntell me once and I think it's a good\nobservation is that you can't\ntechnically feel another person's love\nyou can only feel your own love coming\nout of you for others and I think that\nmight dovetail nicely with what you just\nsaid so I agree with everything you just\nsaid about love I think that's wonderful\ncome on We're not gonna have fun if you\nagree with it well I'm not so I'm gonna\npush back a little bit more which is um\nlet's go back to I'm this idea that I\nshould be loved just for who I am what\nif you're unattractive to women just as\nyou are you're going to be unattractive\nto some women just as you are but it's\nalso what is your basis of\nattraction one of the things I found\nwell let me come come at this with still\ntwo ways one of one of piece about this\nyou know looking for love outside of\noursel um one of my uh certified coaches\nwrote a book recently called uh sipping\nfear pissing confidence and it's it's\nwritten it's great great book amazing\nbook written from a point of dealing\nwith addiction for men but he covers a\nlot of stuff but there's a line in there\nwhen I was listening to the audio book\nhe said a man doesn't mature until he\nquits seeking the love of a woman and\nthat hit me is so true because what what\nare we out there trying to find a\nsubstitute Mommy to come love us because\nwe don't love oursel all that much and I\nthought that really is true as long as\nwe're seeking love from a woman as a guy\nwe're we're in an immature State you\nknow it's love me love me think I'm\ngood-look enough to be attracted to you\nknow love me enough to want to have sex\nwith me and all of that is putting all\nof our internal power in the hands of\nsome somebody else okay so so there\nthere there's one piece of it but let's\nbring it back to that whole\nattractiveness what if I'm not\nattractive enough to attract women\num most men get it wrong what's\nattractive to women now you know I don't\nknow I'm sure Studies have been done on\nattractiveness I I don't know how to\neven Define you know what what defines\nwhat you're attracted to in another\nperson it might be some physical traits\nit might be some emotional traits it\nmight be some energetic traits it might\nbe personality might be behaviors might\nbe all of the above it might be based on\nyour relationship with your mother and\nyour third grade girlfriend I don't know\nI honestly do not know how to figure out\nwhy I'm attracted to what I'm attracted\nto now I do know I'm highly attracted to\nunhappily married women I do know that\nyou know has nothing to do with their\nphysical features I just know that my\nfirst love object was an unhappily\nmarried woman and you know I I I I'm\nhighly drawn to I can fix that I can fix\nthat I can make that better so I I've\nlearned to watch that one right I've\nlearned to pay attention to it but like\nmy wife will accuse me you were looking\nat that woman what kind of woman are you\nattracted are you attracted to this or\nthat women always ask guys what kind of\nwomen are you attracted to and I go I\nguess ones that Treat Me Nice um but you\nknow it's not like oh I'm attracted to\nblondes or tall or short or curly hair\num I think that's just too too\nsimplistic and when men start trying to\nfigure out what women are attracted to\nwomen are attracted to drug dealers to\nmen in prison to to short guys to porn\nstars to you know pro athletes to to you\nknow Saints you know I don't know so\nwhatever a man thinks is what makes a\nwoman attracted to a man he's almost\nalways going to be wrong because I you\nknow I always thought well if I didn't\nlike have the nice square jaw full head\nof hair you know if I didn't have the\nproverbial Alpha you know look to me I\nthought I would not be physically\nattractive to women and then when women\nstarted telling me Oh you have kind eyes\noh I love your kissable lips or I love\nyour hands I mean what the [ __ ] what is\nit about my hands that some woman would\nfind attractive but women have told me\nthat now was it probably more than my\nhands was it probably more than my kind\neyes was it I don't know now I I have\nsome theories that in general what women\nin general find attractive but again if\na man tries to figure out well if I just\nbe this do that that'll make women\nattract me well I'm being that doing\nthat and they don't seem to be attracted\nto me therefore I must not be attractive\nagain that's basing you know okay women\nin general want to have sex with me or\ndon't want to have sex with me that's\ngoing to determine my worth my value my\nattractiveness again that's a real\nfragile\num measuring stick of our worth and our\nlovability okay I buy all of that and I\nhave a whole chapter about this in my\nupcoming book on sexual Marketplace\nvalue and I do think that I love that\nchapter that's a great chapter to I do\nthink that we culturally have let's say\narchetypes for male and female Beauty\nand that the more a man or a woman\nAccords with those biologically informed\nand culturally influenced standards the\nhigher\na person's attractiveness is but\nabsolutely no man is attractive to all\nwomen no woman is attractive to all men\nand ultimately what it comes down to is\nperceived sexual Marketplace value\nbecause even though all other things\nbeing equal this person might be more\nattractive to more people if his let's\nsay normalized sexual Marketplace value\nis higher it all comes down to the point\nof transaction with that person that\nyou're dealing with and people very wild\nwildly with respect to their tastes uh\nin partners in the\nbedroom um attraction oh yes so about\nwhat you said as long as men\nare trying to become attractive in order\nto get women in order to get laid\nthey're already they've already kind of\nlost because they've given their power\naway I can agree with that but I think\nthat's a tough cell I think men kind of\nhave to be catfished into\nself-development I think in the\nbeginning it has to be mo because it's\nthe strongest motivation in the world\nfor a guy is to want to get laid and\nonly as he starts to level up and maybe\ntake care of his lifestyle and his\nfashion and his wealth and his game does\nhe realize oh this is inherently\nrewarding and this is good for me but I\ndon't think he get I'm laughing because\nI I because I I do agree with that in\ngeneral that you know i' I've written a\ncouple of books one dating Essentials\nfor men the other one dating Essentials\nfor men frequently asked questions and\num I say in the book I say this book is\na dating book I'm calling it a dating\nbook because you want to learn how to\ndate and you want to get late the truth\nis is how to expand your social and\nemotional intelligence book that's\nreally what it's going to teach you the\nmotivation is you want to attract women\nand you want to have a girlfriend you\nwant to get late um but I'm going to\nteach you how to do some things that are\ngoing to increase the odds of doing that\nand and it really is by teaching men how\nto expand their social and emotional\nintelligence that I believe makes them\nmore generally attractive um I I'll give\nyou just a couple thoughts kind of a\nfoundation for how how I intend to\napproach it I'll give you one example I\nI just started reading a book last night\nI got in bed got my Kindle out and I\nthought all right I'm tired of reading\nself-improvement books business books\nmarketing books I pulled up a fiction\nbook that I had um just on a whim\ndownloaded a month or so ago um it's I\nthink it's called The Little Liar by\nMitch Alba and it's it's written during\num uh Nazi World War II\nand and the book kind of starts out with\nsome some people on a Nazi train being\ntaken to a death camp and then it then\nit it Segways into a commentator in the\nbook is truth and truth is talking to us\nand and Truth is the personification of\nof you know truth and truth even says\nthat anybody who is\ntruthful is immediately more\nattractive I'm probably not quot quoting\nit exactly but it gave a reference to\nthis very physically attractive young\nboy but because he was truthful\neverybody was attracted to him and he\nsaid very few people truth say very few\npeople are actually truthful so I you\nknow I could take that that I think\nthere\nare energetic and emotional\ndynamics that create far more powerful\nattraction than the shape of your nose\nsize of your jaw the Venus of your body\nthat your perceived market value do\nthose things help yeah they help in\nterms of triggering uh H A chemical\nreaction in a woman's brain that you\nknow Evolution put in there you know\nthat guy's fit he's strong he can take\ncare of me of course that stuff is there\nit doesn't\nhurt but what what is it about those\npeople that don't have those features\nbut yet even as men were drawn to them\nwe like their energy we like how we feel\naround them we like listening to them we\nwe feel comfortable engaging with them\nwhat are those features and those\nfeatures work with women and you know\none of the things that I say and and um\nuh whenever I say this to like a woman\ncoach like if I'm if I'm being\ninterviewed by a woman and I and I say\nyou know I found that the feminine and\nI'll speak of the feminine as an\nenergetic State um so whether it's women\nyou know dogs cats babies Adventure\nmoney opportunity the feminine is highly\nattracted we just lost something we did\nwhat happened oh on my end my screen\nwent all right must have been a zoom\nthing or a screen looks like we're still\nrecording we're good okay we're good\nI'll back\nup feminine take a breath the feminine\nso I say the feminine is highly attract\nnow feminine I mean women dogs cats\nbabies money Adventure opportunity is\nhighly attractive to a man who is\ncomfortable in his own\nskin knows where he's going and he looks\nlike he's having a good time going there\nI'll say that to women coaches and you I\ngot the chuckle out of you and the women\ngo they they sigh ah yeah yeah and\nbecause you know they're used to you\nknow working with men usually these\nwomen coaches are usually coaching men\nand the men come in because I watch\nenough [ __ ] on the internet from all the\npickup guys and all the dating gurus\nthat basically says you need this line\nyou need these physical features you\nneed this Alpha Behavior you need this\nthing you need that thing and and all\nthese guys none of them actually get\ncomfortable in their own skin kind of\ngoing back to that self-love thing you\nknow I like me I I like my life I like\nhow I live it I'm comfortable living it\non my terms you know using a\npsychological term I'm differentiated\nyou know I I I I show up live my life I\nhave internal locus of control another\npsychological term that in general is\nhighly attractive to Outsiders men and\nwomen and I think if men can go to work\non those pieces and quit worrying about\njudging themselves of are they do they\nhave sixpack abs do they have enough\nhair are they young enough do they have\nyou know the the V features of their B I\nthink when a guy quits worrying about\nthat [ __ ] and goes about living his life\non his terms all of a sudden he notices\nall these really good things start com\nto me I don't have to make it happen I\nagree with all that at the end but I\ndon't know if I can sign off on people\nfind the truth attractive I think if\npeople really found the truth attractive\nthe world would look very different than\nit does today well I I I I agree with\nthat but tell you what test\nthis go look go go go out in public and\nwatch a couple that's obviously been\ntogether for a while in public husband\nand wife and the the ones who look the\nmost bored the most distracted the most\non their phones the most disinterested I\npromise you that's a couple that quit\ntelling each other the truth a long time\nago I have an episode coming out on this\nnext week the truth is never boring it's\nnever boring truth is never boring and I\ntell you what women are not attracted to\nboring men and as soon as a man starts\nrepressing his truth who am I what do I\nthink what do I feel what do I want\nwhere am I going and trying to do\nwhatever it is he thinks is going to\nattract a woman he's repressed his own\ninner truth and now all of a sudden he's\ngoing to be inherently\nboring so again does truth make people\ninherently attractive how about I that\nwas just a quote from the book but is is\nis more along the lines of is I think\nour energetic states that make us the\nmost attractive so if you do not\nwithhold your truth because like for\nexample in in dating Essentials for\nyou know and and when I talk with guys\nI'll say listen the thing that will make\nyou most interesting and attractive to\nwomen is be yourself and guys go well\nthat doesn't seem to be working out so\nwell so far you know being who I am\ndoesn't seem to be turning many very\nmany women on and I'll go how many women\nhow many people do you even let you see\nthe real you how many people know how\nmuch you look at pornography how how how\nhow many people know you know how how\nmuch you dislike yourself or how\ninsecure you are or how many people do\nyou let actually see your those things\nabout you and the truth is nobody we\ndon't let anybody see that [ __ ] and you\nknow what I found for me when I started\ndating in my late 40s and early\n50s I had what I considered\nunprecedented success women were coming\non to me they were getting naked on\nfirst dates they were propositioning me\nmajority of them were significantly\nyounger than me and I wasn't trying I\nwasn't chasing them I've since my second\nmarriage I've never tried to get a woman\nto have sex and and I never had a\nshortage of sex and I thought what\nplanet have I landed on I wasn't getting\nbetter looking you know I I didn't have\nmore money I filed bankruptcy after my\nmy second marriage I you know so I was\nbroke but the thing that I think turned\nwomen on and men as well was I was\nauthentic I was real I didn't hold\nanything back I was playful I was fun I\ndidn't give a [ __ ] and and so I took\nrisk and vulnerable that seemed to be\nreally attractive to people and all of a\nsudden you know I'm going man I'm\ngetting a lot of dates guys are say tell\nus what to do you know I don't really\nknow what I'm doing I'm just kind of\nbeing out there being myself I think the\nindifference is key Robert because the\nvulnerability is often a double-edged\nsword I was told that women wanted men\nwho were vulnerable and emotionally\nintelligent and whatnot and in my teens\nand early 20s I often would share a lot\nof my deep dark yeah uh insecurities and\nuh let me tell you did not have the\nintended effect but maybe that is\nbecause I was still doing so out of a a\ncovert contract in the sense of like if\nI do this then I will be rewarded with\nsex and a relationship and that's\ncertainly not true and because you were\nstill doing what you thought was going\nto make women attracted to you yeah\nexactly right you were still following a\nscheme because you you someone told you\noh this will make you attractive to\nwomen oh I will do more of that and uh\nall you found out is that you know women\nkind of saw you as needy and insecure\nyeah pretty much vulnerability doesn't\nmean you turn every woman into your\ntherapist your emotional tampon I mean\nthat's not what we're talking about I I\ngive you an example a today\nexample you mentioned you're getting\nover a flu a cold and and I mentioned\nyeah this week I I had something just\nknocked me out I don't know what felt\nlike allergies but like I just slept all\nlast month Monday and today's Thursday\nso I'm kind of getting back at it and I\nI usually am up early but I slept in so\nI didn't get up with my wife and take\nthe dog walking so this morning we're\nwalking the dog and I just shared with\nmy wife and she's not who I go to for my\nemotional work I have plenty of guy\nfriends in my life that I do that\nemotional work with but she does need to\nknow in general what's up with me you\nknow I don't I don't withhold that from\nher but so we're walking the dog and I I\nsaid you I I think I'm a little\ndepressed I said I've just felt no\nenergy GIS which is in Spanish my wife's\nMexican no GIS no no drive and um and\nshe kind of got quiet I thought you know\nthat's when they'd say oh don't be that\nvulnerable the woman will feel unsafe\nand unpredicted and I even thought you\nknow that could make her feel a little\nbit oh no you know because you know\nshe's a tough woman she grew up eight\nout of 10 kids poverty guadara Mexico\nshe's been beat up beat on by everybody\nin her life family neighbors and and\nshe's tough I mean she she goes to the\ngym two hours a day she's done myi she's\ndone kickboxing I don't pick fights with\nher and and but you know a couple times\nwhen I've had some serious illness and\neven close to death a few years ago it\njust I could tell it just devastated her\njust because like oh no you know he's\ngoing away so I I mentioned this morning\nI think I'm a little depressed that's\nall I said didn't go into details just\ndon't have a lot of energy and I even\nthought that's probably about as much\ninformation as I need to give her we get\nback and um I I I I had a call I got off\nthe call this morning and there was uh\ntwo plates of fruit sitting out on the\nbar and she was all dressed up she was\ngoing out to have breakfast with her\ngirlfriend there's a a plate of fresh\ncut pineapple a plate of fresh cut uh uh\npapaya and she goes I I did this for you\nand I said thank you I love it that's\ngreat I'm so appreciative and she says\nyou know I'm always thinking about you\nand I go I know that I know how much you\nlove me she goes and I I'm all dressed\nup because you know I always want to\nlook good for you and I said I know that\nI appreciate that and so she went out\nand then um I I texted her after my\nphone call I said I'm gonna hit the gym\nwe have a gym in the house so I got got\nmy video on did my workout because\nbecause I haven't felt well I haven't\nworked out for about a week and a half\nand she always kind of gets on my case\nif I don't work out much so she comes\nback and I said I got my workout in I\nsaid yeah I think I'm feeling a little\nbetter she goes because you got in the\ngym I said no because you made me fruit\nand you know I I kind of put it back you\nknow thank you for loving on so the\npoint is yeah a woman does want to know\nI'm struggling a little bit with this do\nthey want us to sit and just kind of you\nknow give them the whole story no they\nthey they they really don't again where\ndo you find that Tipping Point uh you\ncan usually watch it in their body\nlanguage when when you've gone too far\nwith it they actually kind of get bored\nand want to withdraw so I tell guys have\ngood guy friends have good men in your\nlife and I do when I'm struggling\nthere's other men fact I told my best\nfriend last night in a voice message he\nhe said I'm kind of coming out on my\nmonthlong funk and I go I had a\nweek-long funk and I said I think I'm\nstarting to come out of it I tell other\npeople other guys about that and and\nthen I can just give my wife kind of the\nguy version\nof yeah that sounds right to me I made\nan episode a long time ago called the\ncaptain can't complain so if you're\nleading the relationship and you're you\nknow imagine you're the captain of the\nship and you're heading into a storm if\nyou bring the whole crew together and\nsay oh my God I don't know if I'm going\nto get through this oh jeez I don't I'm\nnot really sure we're going to be able\nto survive they're going to be looking\nfor the the next exit off that boat and\nthey'd be right to do it but you\nobviously can't hide the fact that\nthere's a Squall coming so the idea is\nto forth you know directly face the\nissue talk about what's going to be done\nto address the issue and and still hope\nthat we're going to get through it\ntogether I think that's kind of the\nrecip for doing that beautiful\nillustration and it kind of felt like\nthat's the way it was with my wife I\njust said I'm just feeling a little bit\ndepressed and didn't go in a lot of\ndetail you know she kind of contributed\nby cutting some fruit I took care of me\nby getting in the gym and get a workout\nin I'm getting out of the shower you\nknow she says are you feeling better I\nsaid yeah you know thanks for the fruit\nso you know we work together but no I\ndidn't dump that on her that she had to\nfigure out how to get her husband over\nthis temporary depression and you I took\nresponsibility for just telling her I\ngot to the gym I know always makes her\nmore attracted to me a lot of the advice\nabout self-improvement for men it it\nkind of feels ultimately like Buddhism\nat its core in the sense that like\npeople often go to Buddhism because they\nwant to escape suffering right and the\nBuddha says well the root of suffering\nis desire well and the desire to escape\nsuffering is a desire so like it's this\nkind of a paradox so if you say well the\nway to to get with women is to not care\nto get with women so it's like okay if I\nstop caring then I will get the women it\njust it it doesn't quite make sense I\ndon't actually teach that uh I I\nactually do quote the Buddha at times\nbut I don't teach it I I'm not I don't\nteach indifference um and and and Buddha\ndidn't teach indiff indifference\neither he he taught not attachment which\nmight not be the same thing u i i i i\ndefine it differently yeah I I I talk\nabout being outcome agnostic so for\nexample you know I I I talk to this well\nanother way I put it is being equally\nokay with every possible outcome sure so\nI'm talking to a woman in public it for\nme being nonattached is again I'm I'm\nI'm outcome agnostic I'm gonna talk to\nher I'm gonna put action into this if it\ngoes somewhere great if it doesn't go\nanywhere great I'm equally okay with\neither outcome that I don't call\nindifference indifference would be I\ndon't give a [ __ ] I'm not gonna even\nbother right I I I I'm a big fan of\ntaking action but taking action that's\nnot tied to it's got to turn out this\nway or it was is a waste or because that\njust you know often quote the Buddhist\nas the Buddhist says that the attachment\nis the cause of all suffering and then I\nadd for guys it's also the cause of all\nanxiety as soon as I get attached I want\nthat pretty girl to give me a phone\nnumber your anxiety levels just gone up\nand you've made her the alpha because\nshe's the decider and that's not going\nto play very well that will not come\nacross as outcome indifferent or outcome\nexcuse me agnostic fair enough but I can\nstill imagine that there's at least some\nguy out there who are thinking maybe not\neven consciously but thinking okay so if\nI'm just outcome agnostic then I will\nget the girl then it will work so let's\nlet's address that issue not about\noutcome agnostic but about guides\nokay I love working with guys my my\nentire business my career my life is\nbuilt around working with men I was a\nmarriage therapist for for 25 plus years\nonce nor Mr Nice Guy came out 20 plus\nyears ago my business has just moved\ntowards working with guys I love working\nwith guys you can take the big stick out\nand smack guys upside the head get their\nattention say what the [ __ ] were you\nthinking and they'll go thank you that\nhelp very direct I've never I've NE I've\nworked I work exclusively with men in my\nprivate practice and I can't tell you\nhow many guys are when they first meet\nwith them they're like don't sugarcoat\nit tell me the ugly truth I need someone\nto to knock some sense into me it's so\nrefreshing guys would do that yeah I\ncan't do that with women I I heard Terry\na pretty well-known marriage and family\ntherapist and a feminist say one time\nyou can't begin with the woman in\nmarriage counseling because she'll leave\nthe guy you can you can take the big\nstick out to the guy and he goes thanks\nyou know nobody's ever put it that way\nbefore I love that about\nmen men also drive me [ __ ] crazy\ntrying to trying to run a business you\nknow they they won't read the\ninstructions you know they if if they\ncan be confused they will be if they can\nmisinterpret something they will well if\nif something can be turned black and\nwhite they'll make it black and white\nthey get no sense of context I'll have\nguys say Robert I heard on one podcast\nyou said this but on another podcast you\nsaid that that's a contradiction and\nI'll go what was I talking about on the\nfirst podcast well I think you were\ntalking to a guy that like just read\nself-help books 247 I said okay stop\nreading self-help books and but what was\nthe contact the other one oh it's a guy\nthat never you know like even asked\nhimself who am I said well okay read a\nbook whatever well that's just a dumb\nexample but but if guys can do that they\nwill and that is why they are a sucker\nthat's why men are suckers for all the\n[ __ ] pushed to them on the internet\nI think we passed the 15 minute Mark so\nwe we bring in that you know everything\nfor example you know these long websit\nto say you know the use these six tricks\nto get every you know outrageously hot\nwoman to take her clothes off instantly\nand get with you guys believe that and\nwe'll read the whole thing and we'll\nclick on the clickfunnel and then we'll\nthen we'll go through the upsell and I\ngo because we all know what the\nadvantage is of having a crazy hot woman\nright like we just we all know what the\nadvantage of that is I don't know\nactually explain it to me what is the\nadvantage of having a crazy hot woman in\nyour life I've had some I I I I I won't\npreach the advantages of it but we all\nassume want that and then just men say\ngive me the technique I'll do the\ntechnique how come the technique isn't\nworking I must not be attractive enough\nor women must all be X Y or Z because\nthat so I'm going to go be an incel or\nGo My Own Way or join a red pill Clan or\ndo this because all women are that way\nand and so this is the stuff we run into\nwith men I love working with men but\nyou're gonna always run into that black\nand white well I heard this it must be\ntrue and the other thing we'll do is\nwe're constantly searching for more\ninformation it's not like we have enough\ninformation to actually apply it and go\nout some guy on on on my online Forum\nthe other day said Robert basically what\nhe said is Robert can you reconcile what\nyou teach about relationship with what\nJohn gotman teaches about relationship\nwith what red pill teaches about\nrelationship I've been reading and I go\nstop stop don't do that you're gonna\nmake you're making yourself crazy I said\nthere's probably some overlap between me\nJohn gotman and red pill and I said and\nwe're saying very different things for\nvery different reasons and if you want\nme to try to come make them all work\ntogether in your mind I'm not going to\ndo it don't you even try but that's what\nguys will do we're always looking for\nthat next shiny thing that's going to be\nthe trick that makes everything work\nbecause no one's ever taught us you know\nyou have to work at something you have\nto actually you know bring your aame you\ngot to show up with your lunch pil you\ngot to go through the difficult things\nyou got to learn to deal with tension\nwith anxiety and learn to soothe\nyourself and learn to ground yourself\nand let go of these attachments to\noutcome that are causing your suffering\nbecause again there's s there's so many\nquick easy fixes out there on the\ninternet that yeah let me go pay my\nmoney let me go pay my money because you\nknow this guy tells me it's gonna work\nand anyway there's my little rant about\nhow much I love guys and working with\nguys because I really do I hear you um\none thing that I found in my own\nexperience as I went through my self uh\ndevelopment process about 10 years ago\nis\nthat some of the nice guys are right\nwith respect to\nhonesty when when nice guys are\ndishonest when they're hiding their\nintentions when they're executing the\ncovert\ncontracts they usually get rejected the\nvast majority of time but they tend to\nget rejected nicely what I found is that\nwhen you when you start being more\nauthentic when you start being more\nhonest\nabout your\nintentions and when you start being\nlet's say more well I I guess it I'm not\nquite yet at I wasn't quite yet at the\noutcome\nagnosticism but I women will reject you\nnot all of them some of them will accept\nyou but they'll reject you much more\nforcefully good it's like I've I've\nnever I've never been so um how do I put\nthis the the people who have hurt me the\nmost in life were have been women who\nrealized they weren't going to get what\nthey wanted from\nme okay how'd they hurt you oh\nuh with with yelling and screaming\nverbal abuse uh destroying property\nfalse allegations spreading rumors\nreputation destruction things like\nthat what did that have to I'm acting\nconfused what did that have to do you\nbeing uh truthful and up\nfront um what I what I'm suggesting is\nthat when when you're when you're nice\nyou tend to not get what you want but\nyou often don't get\num you don't get like the vindictiveness\nThe Crazies kind of you know I I I I\ndon't know that's not been my experience\nthe nicer I was the crazier the women I\nattracted because I put up with it I put\nup with it here let me back up just a\nlittle bit when you mentioned the\nrejection\nI'm a big fan of rejection um I I I\npreach it in in in my materials for\ndating is is if we're gonna have an\nintention the in if the intention is I\nwant that girl to like me I want that\ngirl to give me a phone number that\nprobably is going to lead to suffering\nto manipulation to you know to you being\nless\nindirect but if your intention is to I\ncall it get to rejection quickly in\nbusiness is called fail forward fail\nfast that that kind of mentality just\njust go for it go all in with it and see\nyou know see what\nhappens I have found that yeah if I'm\njust fully me don't hold anything back\nyou know one of the things I teach guys\nand again guys want to turn everything\ninto a technique I I teach something I\ncall the three tees touch teas and till\nI don't I never meant it to be a\ntechnique but guys will always look\nteach us more about how to touch teach\nus more about how to tease I go no\nthat's just a reminder don't hold back\nif you have the impulse to touch her\ntouch her if you have the impulse to\nteach her be playful if you have the\nimpulse to to to tell her what to do do\nit don't hold back act on impulse be you\ndon't hold anything about you back now\nthe more you're not being you and and\nthe more you're being you and not hold\nanything back you will find out really\nquickly how that\nlands and that's what you want to know\nif you're being nice and using covert\ncontracts and what I call nice guy\nseduction of doing things for listening\nto her for hours and then you know\npaying off her carpet whatever it is you\ncan never find out is she into you or\nnot but if you actually don't hold back\nby practicing what I call that getting\nthe rejection quickly you can let go of\nyour crush you can let go of whatever\nunrealistic fantasy you had about her\nand move the [ __ ] on and open the door\nfor somebody that's actually going to\ncome into your life and treat you well\nnow the women who are vindictive and\ntreat you badly now I've been there too\nbut the truth of it is that's a boundary\nissue of of of a problem that when a\nguy's trying to get a woman to like them\nthey tend to ignore those red flags\nearly on they see the bad behaviors\nearly on but my my tendency and a lot of\nnice guys my superpower is talking to\nwoman down through and over and getting\nher back to good and so unfortunately if\nI do that in those early warning\nsigns it keeps me hanging out with a\nwoman that I'm going to keep seeing a\nworse and worse side of her and\nwhen a woman lashes out and acts\nvindictive towards you I'm going to\nventure to guess there were probably\nwarning signs that a guy saw that he\nignored prior to that it rarely comes\ncompletely out of the blue it's possible\nand certainly if she didn't run out of\nthe door I showed her the door very soon\nafterwards I guess my point is I'm I'm\nagreeing with you in the sense that the\nmore you come into yourself the more you\ncome into your masculine the more you're\nnot afraid to what you want and live\nyour life as you see\nfit I would say a a proportion of women\nbecome much more attracted to you\nand when if and when you do not give\nsome of those women what they want Hell\nhath no fury like a woman's scorn they\ndon't really seem to care when the men\nthat they're not attracted to don't give\nthem what they want that's why I think\nthe nice guys get rejected more softly\nyou understand I I I I I get that point\num\nand I I still don't I still don't think\nI'd want to do it any other way um I I I\nheard a quote uh I I was at a conference\nyears ago with David data he wrote the\nbook way the superior man probably you\nknow a lot of men have heard of that he\nmade a comment that I had to ponder for\na little bit and then it just really\nlanded but he said choose a woman who\nchooses you absolutely and what happens\nyou pring guys go out well I'm I'm\nchoosing that woman because she's hot\nand and but she hasn't chosen us and now\nwe're doing all these things jumping\nthrough hoops trying to get her to like\nus buying her stuff whatever whatever\nour typical way of Seduction is to try\nto get her to choose us I see married\nmen do this I did it in in a previous\nmarriage guys will say uh Dr Glover you\nknow we've been married for over 15\nyears my wife hadn't hasn't wanted to\nhave sex since our kid was born 12 years\nago how can I you know turn her on and\nmake her want to have sex I go I think\nyour wife quit choosing you a long time\nago and and you're still trying to get\nher to choose you you know I've tried\neverything\nso if we choose a woman who chooses us\nnow a lot of guys again going back to\nthat nice guy thing or just the guy\nthing guys will say well but I want the\nhot ones and only the women the only\nwomen seem to choose me are kind of the\nfat older ones that I don't really want\nand and I go okay I I get it I'm not\ngonna argue that point but that's not\nbeen my experience my experience is if\nI've been out there being me I'll keep\ncoming back to that being me living my\nlife on my terms not chasing any woman\nnot trying to get any woman to like me\nand especially not trying to get any\nwoman to have sex with me that's a point\nwhere a lot of guys run into trouble is\nwe're hiding our sexual agenda while\npushing the a sexual agenda all at the\nsame time and and I I tell guys if you\ngot your foot on the gas and her foot's\nstill on the break the more you put your\nfoot on the gas the more her foot's\ngoing on the break so trying to get any\nwoman to have sex is usually what how\nguys you know end up a hashtag me too\ncasualty is we're trying to push an\nagenda rather than when the woman has\nchosen us she will let us know without a\ndoubt she's ready she's open take me\nright so I I I want that kind of woman\nnow is that kind of woman maybe going to\nbe disappointed in me if I don't choose\nher\nback yeah there's that possibility but I\nalso\nfound that only seemed to happen if I\nwas may be in some way either leading\nher on or didn't end something when it\nneeded to be ended CU like when I first\nstarted dating because I hadn't had a\nlot of sex in my second marriage and I\nhad I wasn't particularly experienced\nbefore\nmarriage I said I'm going to say yes to\nevery sexual opportunity and I did and I\nwent to what I call my my integrated\nManor stage and I I was just consciously\nsaying yes and consciously letting women\nknow I was not exclusive now you can\ntell a woman that and they can know it\nintellectually but once they're you know\nonce they feel that attraction or once\nthey're once they're hooked um is kind\nof like they forget that you know the\nchemistry takes over the chemicals take\nover and I found that if I kept those\ngoing on just because well you know I'm\ngetting laid you know regular but I knew\nI did not want what I had a growing\nsense she wanted I learned after a few\nkind of rough experiences end that\nrather sooner rather than later to where\nit did not keep going on because it was\nconvenient and enjoyable for me but yet\nI realized she was getting a deeper\nconnection than I was um so I just took\nthat on me it it it it it it saved me a\nlot of messes further down the road I\nhear what you're saying you might be\nright I do think that potentially means\nthat you're taking you know agency away\nfrom the woman in the sense that if\nshe's not getting what she wants why\nwouldn't her be her responsibility to\ntake herself out of that Arrangement but\nbut they they don't they don't count on\nthat yeah I I say this in one of my\nepisodes people don't want what they\nwant oh so people want what they want\nnot what wants them and so you can't get\nsomeone to like you by liking them more\nand one of the worst things that you can\ndo is to start doing things for someone\nto try to increase their desire for you\nin fact the research suggests that if\nyou actually want someone to like you\nmore you should ask them to do things\nfor you what's the term for that there's\nthere's a psychological term based on\nlike a present is not the coolage effect\nbut there's another where somebody you\nknow there's a term for it I can't\nremember the the the term given to that\nyeah psychologically if somebody if you\nask somebody they do something for you\nthey have to justify in their mind\nexactly that if I'm doing this for this\nperson\nI I I I must value them yeah I don't do\nthings for any old Joker I don't usually\ngo out of my way for people so why am I\ndoing it for Orion oh I must think he's\nan interesting guy I must have some and\nand we'll talk ourselves into it you\nknow and whether or not that lasts very\nlong I don't know but yeah you you hit\nthe nail on it I tell nice guys this the\nmore you do for a woman all that's\nprobably going to do is create more\nexpectation that you're going to do\nstuff for it doesn't create a deep\nlike or attraction on her part yeah\nlet's talk about this Robert because um\nI I teach that the most common male\nsexual strategy is to be a taxi cab in\nthe sense that they show up they roll up\nto the woman and say hey sweetheart\nwhere do you want to go I'll take you\nwherever you want to go come on you want\nto go to Dubai you want to go to Miami\nyou want to go to Vegas you want\ndiamonds you want meals you want drinks\nI'm here to make it happen and a lot of\nwomen will get in that cab yeah and the\nguys will drive around for a while maybe\nfor years and then one day they might\nturn around and say Hey you know we've\nbeen going to where you wanted to go for\nquite some time do you think maybe you\ncould get up here and drive me somewhere\nand that woman's gonna get the [ __ ] out\nof that cab because that's not how cabs\nwork can you imagine if a cab driver\nactually did that in real life just say\ntrip pull over here let me off at this\ncorner that's good so when you do start\noff when when your primary relationship\nstrategy is I'm here to serve you right\nwell that's what she's signing up for\nand it would be kind of a a breach of\ncontract almost if you were to change\nthat further down the road or mid trip\nlike I can understand why why women\nwould bounce at that point well it is\nbecause you know I've worked with nice\nguys for 30 years and so for example if\na guy who's been being that nice guy in\na longterm relationship you know doing\neverything she wanted sacrificing his\nwants and needs giving up all all his\nguy friends always being there beck and\ncall and now all of a sudden you know he\nreads my book or he comes to therapy\nwith me or whatever and he starts\nrealizing I need to say no I need to\nhave boundaries I need to make my needs\na priority I I need to fill my own\nbucket I need to ask for what I want and\nhe starts doing that oh it's gonna be\nhard you know when when before I I'm I'm\ngoing on memory here this doesn't have\nto be accurate but before I wrote No\nMore Mr nice guy would say that you know\nthat when that happens I give it about a\n5050 chance of the relationship making\nit when the guy starts actually\nasserting himself about 5050 Chance some\nwomen are going to say finally you you\nshowed up where have you been I've want\nbecause women love my book they love No\nMore Mr Nice Guy I mean there's been no\nat all negative blowback from women they\nwant them hand to show up most do right\nso then as I I was writing No More Mr\nnice guy I think in the book I might\nhave said I think maybe it's about more\nlike 6040 now that 60% of the\nrelationships won't make it I think by\nthe time that I finish writing No More\nMr Nice Guy 7030 let's go about 8020 now\nthat if the guy changes the fundamental\ncontract of the\nrelationship maybe 20% of the time the\nwoman's going to go you know this may be\na challenge it's going to be a struggle\nI'm in though because I think you're\namazing and I want to be with you but a\nlot are going to fall away just because\nthey got comfortable with how they\nthought things were supposed to be even\nif it wasn't what they wanted cuz I\ndon't think most of the women actually\nwant to get into the back seat of a taxi\ndriver and have the guy do things for\nthem constantly but a lot of times the\nwoman's not going to say no everything\nthe guy wants to do but then after a\nwhile it starts to feel like the norm\nand the wait you're G to take that away\nfrom me now yeah that's when you get the\nreaction easiest way to make a baby cry\nis give a lollipop and then take it away\nand so even though they might not even\neven if they might not have wanted a\nlollipop I don't think lollipops are\nthat great for babies right um they've\ngotten used to it it's sweet and now\nyou've given a taste for something that\nthey're going to not be experiencing for\na while and that's really the guy's\nfault because he's trained the woman to\nexpect that kind of behavior and\ntreatment over those years and I say it\nalways gets worse before it gets better\nbecause you have to deal with the\nextinction bursts that come when you try\nto modify behavior and a pre-existing\nDynamic 8020 I think is probably\ngenerous we could keep evolving the\nnumbers almost always easier to just do\nthe right thing from the beginning and\nto try to fix something I I I I agree\nbut how many of us know to do that you\nknow I I I joke that no I don't joke I\ntell the truth I had a PhD in marriage\nand family therapy at 29 years old and I\nbumbled my way through my three\nmarriages and you know what I think most\nof us are gonna we're gonna Bumble our\nway through life uh I I think that's\nwhat happens now hopefully we we can get\nsome good guides some good mentors some\ngood initiation some good instruction um\nbut again kind of going back to you know\nthere's so much unhelpful stuff out\nthere available now is that men often\ndon't know what to pick like it's it you\nknow can H H how how do I make you know\nDr Glover John gotman and red pill all\nfit together and and you know guys are\ntrying to do that so they don't know\nwhat's the good information and and\nusually the most prominent information\nis the one that uh applies to appeals to\ntheir most base easy how's what's the\neasiest way to make this happen\nnature I hear that and I I believe that\nall those click baity programs that you\nmentioned earlier exist because they\nwork people are buying them not\nnecessarily because they work but\nbecause people are buying them they work\nthey work because they sell product\nthat's what I mean they work I see okay\nfor me personally I've never I've never\nused one of those I've never gone down\nthat funnel but I think for me what was\nthe source of the greatest\nmisunderstanding about women when I was\nyounger was just the mass media and the\nculture uh movies pop songs of\nliterature there's this great play I\ndon't know if you read a lot of drama\nbut it's called boy gets Girl by Rebecca\nGilman she's a very talented playwright\nhave you heard of this Robert I'm not um\nit's an interesting kind of a thriller\nbecause what happens is that there's a\nguy who is trying to court woman and he\nbe he basically starts to act like the\nmen in romantic comedies do and he like\nbuys Billboards to declare his love and\nshows up with the speaker underneath\nthem and like people don't know what to\ndo with him it eventually turns he\nstarts to like follow her around and and\nstalk her a little bit and so it starts\nto go into a dark place but the the core\npremise of the book is he's doing what\nSociety is telling him men are supposed\nto do to get the woman right and let me\ntell you that [ __ ] does not\nwork why do we keep telling\nmen well to do that [ __ ] you know\nbecause it sells it sells you know the\nwomen buy the romantic comedies you know\nthey do do do they really want the guy\nstanding out under the window with the\nspeaker blasting your eyes but you know\nwell how does that work how do they they\nbuy the fantasy but they don't want it\nin reality that's\ninteresting how much have you hung\naround\nwomen fair enough yeah you know when\nthey're watching all those daytime\ndramas and they're watching all the\nnighttime dramas you know and they're\nwritten you know they're W watching um\num gry's Anatomy that's just the dumbest\nass show I've ever seen in my life you\nknow Kardashians just the dumbest ass\nshow and and women flock to that they're\nnot seeking out reality but even think\nabout it when we watch Adventure flicks\nyou know whether it's you know Tom Cruz\nor Sly or you know Ben diesel are we\nlooking for reality no we're looking for\nfor entertainment and Escape But but so\nwhen we start mistaking entertainment\nand Escape for reality that's when we're\ngoing to start having problems well what\ndo you think about this I I made an\nepisode a long time ago called the part\nthat women always leave out because if\nyou ask a woman what she's looking for\nin a man you'll hear things like oh I\nwant somebody who's kind or I want\nsomebody who is uh you know great with\nkids I want somebody who respects me and\na lot of guys are thinking oh okay well\nI can I can do those things why am I not\nhaving the success that I would like\nwith women and I think it's because the\npart that women always leave out is they\nwant those things but they want them\nfrom the men they're already attracted\nto yeah and so that's the key it's not\nlike being those things make a woman\nattracted to you she just wants those\ntraits in the men that she's attracted\nto and so that's the part that men need\nto\nhear well you you've probably even seen\nthe studies that say you know women will\nbe married to that guy that's stable and\nyou know increase a household and then\nwhen they're ovulating they're attracted\nto something totally different oh yeah\nand I I I I I can't I can't bring this\nup as an accurate statistic but I re I\nrecall reading before that\nstatistically\n30% of children in monogamous intact\nmarriages 30% of the kids are not\nbiologically the husband of the woman I\nheard 10% 30% is really high but okay\nwell\nsplit the split the difference right it\nand and and what's that saying is that\nyeah again I said earlier you know women\ncan be attracted to drug dealers to guys\nin prison the they what the women don't\ntell well let's even back this further\nup some some really cool research that\nthat uh I I came across a while ago is a\nuniversity of uh is in Canada it's a\nCanadian study where they studied a lot\nof people around sexual arousal and they\nhooked up men and women you know of of\nall sexual orientations hooked the man\nthe man up to measure engorgement in his\ngenitals and the women as well and and\nthey gave them a button and then they\nshowed them videos okay and the the the\nmen were really believe it or not very\nwhitebred uh and very predictable and\nwhat but what they both physiologically\nresponded to and and what they pushed\nthe button basically heterosexual guys\nwere attracted to heterosexual sex with\nsome threesoms thrown in they were\nconscious of their arousal that's kind\nof your point they they were conscious\nof their arousal had gay men were\nattracted you know gay sex what what\nwhat got reported in all the media was\nthe part of the study that that had\nwomen had surprisingly this really wide\nvariety uh response to sexual fantasy or\nyou know whether it was you know men of\nthe opposite sex female sex sex with\ngorillas you know there it it was at all\nthe extremes that the women were having\na response to and that's what the media\nreported on I went and found the\noriginal study because I'm that kind of\nperson I want to say well really what\nwas\nhere there was another\nsignificantly um statistically\nsignificant finding that none of the\npopular media reported and there was a\nsignificantly St statistical significant\ndifference between what the woman's body\nwas responding to and what her finger\npushed yeah with men there wasn't we\nwe're we're pretty predictable with the\nwomen their body was turned on by one\nthing but they didn't push the button or\nthey pushed the button in said they're\nturned on by their but but their body\nwasn't and in that I tell men don't\nlisten to what women tell you of what\nthey want and what they're attracted to\nso when they say I want a nice guy part\nof the Month part of them really does\nbelieve that another part of the month\nis oh I just got to get [ __ ] by you\nknow it's it's and I'm making maybe an\nexaggeration but maybe not that far okay\nso don't buy into what your sister tells\nyou they want what your mother says\nwomen want what even you know the nice\ngirls that you're seeking the approval\nfrom don't buy into what they tell you\nthat they want watch what they do watch\nand and unfortunately that's when men go\nto that point of well they're just\nattracted to like the alpha males and\nthe bad boys because again we just get\nthat Funnel Vision they like bad boys\nthough that's I'm not but when the when\nthe men go well they're only attracted\nno that's not true and I could tell guys\nyou can actually be a decent guy a\ndecent human being and still create Bad\nBoy energy attraction in women and and\nit can be pretty simple you know not be\ntoo available right not giving them\ngifts asking them to do something for\nyou they're just little tricks that\ncreate that same kind of energy that the\nBad Boys create without you having to be\nan [ __ ] okay that's interesting\nbecause I've shared similar tips on my\nchannel and often the push it's\ngenerally well received but probably the\nmost common push back is something on\nthe lines of oh Orion you know\nyou've you've made it this is\nmanipulative shouldn't I just be myself\nlike why do I have to play these games\nin order to keep a woman interested in\nme what would you say to that I'm saying\nwhat that guy is really saying is he\ndoesn't want to put any work into\ngetting what he says he wants he's just\nas deceitful as the woman who says I\nwant a nice guy he says I want a woman\nbut don't ask me to really work on\nmyself or actually work at doing things\nthat actually makes me attractive to\nwomen I really just want to play video\ngames and surf the Internet and jack off\nto porn please don't ask me to actually\nwork on\nmyself that's what I would say to that\nagain guys say they want a lot of stuff\njust like women women say they want a\nlot of stuff wanting is free it costs\nnothing to want here you\ngo so you know and and then guys you\nknow then I'll get the other thing from\nguys they'll say okay Robert here's a\ncontradiction you say you know work on\nthese things in you and they will make\nyou attractive then they'll go that's a\ncontradiction because now it sounds like\nyou're trying to do things to get women\nto be attracted to you and okay let's\ntake a breath here there are side\neffects of working on you positive side\neffects if you work on you because you\nwant to live your best life you want to\nget out of your comfort zone you want to\nlive at your Edge you want to level up\nto the best version of you you want your\nbest life you want Adventure you want\nopportunity you want fun if you do the\nthings that that that that require focus\nand effort and discipline and\nconsistency to do those things I found\nthere's this side effect over here that\nthat all of a sudden you notice a lot of\nwomen are checking you out a lot of\nwomen are sending you those indicators\nof interest that all the gurus out there\nget so wrong oh she's twirling her hair\nthat's no it's not that's an indicator\nof a stupid woman stupid women twirl\ntheir hair that's not an indicator of oh\nshe crossed her ankles oh give me a\nbreak come on no when when they lean\nover and give you a cleavage shot\nthere's an indicator of interest and\nthey walk in front of you three times\nfor no reason that's an indicator of\ninterest when they touch your arm when\nthey laugh at your dumb chokes those are\nindicators of interest when they my wife\ntaught me this one when they jut a hip\nthat's primate Behavior primates jut\ntheir hips to show they're ready they're\nreceptive for for for sexual intercourse\nwe're [ __ ] primates but but but we\nthink that oh you know whatever we think\nthat women are or aren't we ignore their\nactual indicators of interest because\neither we think they want they're not\nsending that to me or I'm not I'm not\nAlpha enough for them to want me but\nthey are that and that's what when when\nI got really successful at getting with\nwomen is because I started actually\nunderstanding their indicators of\ninterest and it isn't what all the\npickup dudes teach you I'm not watching\nare their eyes constricting or dilating\nor not that's too much work but when I\nactually worked at me getting out of my\nhouse being a social animal overcoming\nyou know my social anxieties and disc\nComfort talking to people being bold\nbeing brave being funny not holding back\nyou know living life on my terms saying\ncome on let's go do this when I started\nbeing that all of a sudden a lot of\nwomen were choosing me and I thought wow\nthis is this is really pretty\ninteresting I didn't have to do anything\nto try to get them to like me I was just\nout having a good time on my own and all\nof a sudden they're paying\nattention do you\nthink well you wrote noer Mr Nice Guy 20\nyears ago you said yeah long before I\nknew any of the stuff you and I are\ntalking about what was the trajectory\nthere\nlike did you experience some that was\neven before not before the entire\ninternet but before the internet kind of\nas we know it did you experience some\nFame as a consequence of that\nbook um not not early on I I I I maybe\njust coming into my fame perhaps well\ndeserved you know you think you think\nthat has something to do with it with\nwhat the the effortlessness with which\nyou attract women these days when in\nwhen I was dating well yeah noways um I\nI I don't know all my my my wife points\nout all the women who I seem to be\nattracting nowadays um I I I actually am\nnot interested in and not paying all\nthat much attention till you know she\ngets mad at me and says that woman was\nflirting with you and I go that's my\nfault how you have a man that women want\nyou know you're not complaining about\nthat are you\num I don't actually respond exactly like\nthat but that's the you know bottom line\nno when I like say when I was in my late\n40s and 50s and started having this kind\nof success um I'd gotten out of a a a\nlong bad marriage I I hadn't been sexual\nfor very long uh very much for very long\nI was actually coming off\nanti-depressants that it kind of killed\nsex drive inter erections I I I went\nthrough a\nbankruptcy um I was driving a subar only\nit's only gonna get up from there\nget better and in spite of all of that\nyou know I was out in public I was\nhaving a good time I was going to listen\nto live jazz I was eating in happy hour\nhours at at at restaurant bars I was\ntalking to the people around me I still\nknow bartenders that I met 20 years ago\nand got to know them by name and you\nknow even getting to know bartenders you\nknow good stuff happens they bring you\ndrinks and stuff they pour that you know\nthe person didn't want bartenders is fun\ntoo I I I was gonna say I've never dated\na bartender but oh they're dangerous I I\nthink I have oh yeah there a reason\nthere's bartenders um but that kind of\nyou know I'm not so much engaged in that\nkind of behavior anymore you know I'm\nkind of more of a homebody I'm home you\nknow working on my stuff working with\nguys um taking the dog for a walk stuff\nlike that but when I was going when I\nwas having that Heyday of my integrated\nManor\nphase I did not you know I was even I'd\neven gotten kind of I was you know a\nlittle bit overweight\nand there was nothing out of the\nordinary special about me and I was\nstill having women you know hit on me\nproposition me get naked on first dates\nand you know I I I tell the story I told\nthis one in a while I had sex with four\ndifferent women in one weekend all of\nthem knew I wasn't exclusively having\nsex with where were you when when this\nhappened in the\nworld where was like what what state did\nI live in or yeah or what country uh I\nwas in uh Belleview Washington actually\nno kidding wow Washington can you can\nyou please define this term for me that\nyou've used a couple times the\nintegrated Manor phase can can you tell\nme a little bit about that you know what\nis it's quite simply I've already given\nyou the core components is that I made\nthe decision to say yes to every sexual\nopportunity that presented itself even\nif she wasn't a 10 even if she was you\nknow I [ __ ] a few fatties uh I quickly\nthat's the wh part so what's the\nintegrated Manor part is that I was very\nconscious about it um practice safe sex\nI let the women know this was not the\nbeginning of a relationship I see the\nwomen know that you know if if you meet\nthem somewhere and they go home with you\nthey know that's not the beginning of a\ngood Rel they know they want to get\n[ __ ] and you do too so I was very\nconscious and integrated very truthful I\nmentioned earlier I also learned to end\nthose relationships in a timely way and\nnot let them go on to where they became\nuh disruptive or ugly uh because the\nwoman was starting to want something\nthat I didn't uh so I was very conscious\nabout it so integrated mean I was\ntelling the truth I was paying attention\nI was acting very lovingly and\nopenhearted to the women one of the\nthose one of the things I know the women\nliked is that when they were with me I\ntreated them like you know they were the\nonly woman on the planet you know I\ntreated them like like they were they\nwere a prince and a porn star all at the\nsame time and\nand a quick story I when I met my wife\ndown here in Mexico like I said she she\nasked me if I wanted a massage and we\nstarted dating for our first year of\ndating she just came to my apartment\nevery Saturday night and we had sex and\nand you know that's it worked for both\nof us that's all we really wanted I\nremember one time fairly early on we're\nhaving sex and it was just wild and\ncrazy good stuff and you know again not\nholding back I I told her in Spanish\nTwitter muta meana you're my Mexican\n[ __ ] as soon as the words came out of\nmy mouth I thought this could go really\nwrong this could go very s very sore um\nand she got more excited more turned on\nI thought you know here's this\npatriarchal white dude in Mexico [ __ ]\nthis poor Mexican woman and saying\nyou're my Mexican [ __ ] and she told me\nlater I don't remember if it was like\nthat night or soon after you know cuz we\nwe'd already kind of we I I like\nnicknames I like giving women nicknames\nand a lot of women seem to like you know\nthat playful nickname stuff she told me\nthat's my favorite nickname if when you\ncall me T meana she she to this day you\nknow if I tell her oh you're looking\nreally paa today you know you know she\nthat's her greatest compliment you if I\nsay you look really nice you know it's\nkind of like oh I'm boring oh baby nowas\nmeans ass\nfans they made us man yeah you're\nlooking really really hor I I love it\nthat's amazing for her for her that's a\nturn on now guys don't go do that with\nevery woman you meet thinking it worked\nfor Dr Glover and his Mexican wife um\ndon't don't be black and white thinking\njust plug that in but but kind of going\nback to the point it was just me not\nholding anything back and like the whole\ntime that my then girlfriend you know\nwere're seeing each other she just knew\nthe whole situation we're seeing each\nother once a month for having SE or once\na week for having sex there was no more\nyou know oh is is this not that you know\nthere wasn't anything more to it it was\njust real clear very conscious very\nintegrated well I think that's because\neverything that you say and do gets\nfiltered through a woman's attraction so\nif she likes you and her attraction is\nvery high you could say something\ncompletely nonsensical and she'd think\nyou're just being silly and that's one\nof your best qualities and if she's not\nshe's going to think that you had an\naneurysm and you need to go to hospital\nso you know what really matters is how\nshe feels about you and she's kind of\nalready made a decision about how she\nfeels about you in advance of really\nmuch of anything usually you know I\nthink we've seen those statistics too\nthat probably what they say in the first\nthree seconds a woman knows if there's a\npossibility she might sleep with you and\nthen while we guys are spending three\nmonths you know doing the nice guy\nseduction they decided in the first\nthree seconds they're not getting naked\nwith us right again the mistakes that\nthat that men made so I tell guys and\nagain guys could probably Mis misspend\nthis one as well if a woman is into you\nyou almost can't [ __ ] that up and if\nshe's not into you there's almost\nnothing you can do to to to switch that\naround either that's just reality and\nlike you say you know I call her Mexican\nwhor like that that was a plus right\nthere's that wasn't going to [ __ ] it up\nbecause she was IND me yeah a woman\nwho's 10 out of 10 attracted to a guy\nwill do scary things she will hide the\nbody she will lie to the C you're\ntalking about my wife you're talking\nabout my wife she she she's she's scary\nfun that's great Robert we're coming up\non time I'd like to know a little bit\nmore about\nyour is it fair to say\ncommunity community that's what we call\nit I I jokingly playfully call it the\nGlover Hood um yeah integration nation\nis is am men's program that I launched\nin July of\n20123 um I I'm just a big believer men\nneed Community we need tribe my most\nsignificant growth processes have\nhappened when I was in community once\nkind of early on in my 30s about five\nsix years in a men's group and then even\njust recently about a year into my\nmarriage with my wife I realized I\nneeded Community I needed men sure down\nin Mexico having to speak Spanish um and\nso I I went looking and I found a men's\nprogram that been in for the last six\nyears I'm now surrounded with men I've\ngot calls I have every week with guys\nthat I know and so I'm a big believer in\ncommunity and so you know somebody\nmentioned to me you know uh a couple\nyears ago Robert you should start you\nknow a men's membership program and you\nknow make your your product available\nall your content and so that's what\nwe've been working on we're still work\nin process we still a way to go but in\nJuly 23 we launched the community part\nof integration nation and um you know we\nhave up to nine um virtual calls a week\nthat guys can jump on every Thursday\nincluding today in about two hours uh no\nless than an hour and a half I'll be on\na community call for integration Nation\nI'll teach a lesson today tonight's\nlesson will be about how to get your\nneeds met how how to get your needs met\nwithout being needy right um nine calls\na week that's a lot I I I'm doing one of\nthem uh and I've certified coaches that\nthat lead seven others and we have a\ncouple you know webinars we do a couple\nmonths so up to nine calls a week uh we\nhave a timeline for guys can communicate\nwith each other we have some other\nchallenges that we'll offer we're about\nto start uh inperson meetups around the\nworld just casual get togethers for guys\nuh we're about to start some peer-led\nsupport groups as part of the program\nand this is just the basic part we're\ngoing to launch more uh later this year\num so you know I'm just a big fan you\nknow\nguys you know wherever we're struggling\nin life I tend to say is probably due to\na lack of good men and I think almost\nanything that's not working well in our\nlife if we go get connected well with\nmen those things will start changing uh\nhow they look how they working I can\ncertainly Echo what you said about how\nmen need male community and tribe I\npresented at a Men's Conference a few\nweekends ago it was in a big room I\nthink there was about a hundred people\nin it and I and they were all men and I\ncould not remember the last time I had\nbeen in a room that size without a\nsingle woman in it it was shocking um\nand it felt so like safe and relaxing\nit's not like when there were no women\naround we were just saying ah these\nwomen blah blah blah blah but it was we\ncould talk directly I don't think\nanybody was afraid that our we were\ngoing to be misinterpreted right it it\nwas wonderful and I I didn't know how\nmuch that meant to me until I was in\nthat I didn't know it's like missing the\nsound of water when you've lived in the\ndesert your whole life what a great way\nto put it wow we we need it and you know\nour ancestors had it\nand you don't know how bad you need it\nto like you know I'll do a weekend\nWorkshop here you know in my home and\nyou know I have eight guys here and you\nknow they're all strangers when they\nstart out on Friday Night by Sunday\nthey're like they've been frat brothers\nyou know for 20 years they care about\neach other they're they're getting on on\nZoom with each other ongoing and and we\njust need it and again I love how you\nput it you we don't know how bad we need\nit till we discover it and that was true\nfor me you know most nice guys I work\nwith most men say I'm more comfortable\naround around women well because we get\nvalidation from them um but again I I'll\nsay I think the masculine is a source of\nlove if you want to really feel love you\nconnect with your masculine self and you\nconnect with men and then we can be love\nwe can overflow love into the world so\nyeah I'm a I'm a big fan of that so\nintegration Nation if you you guys want\nto check it out integration nation.net\num just go sign up we'll send you an\ninvitation and you know come check out\nthe community we're building I said it's\nstill a work in process okay so we have\nthe community we have the book No More\nMr Nice Guy there's a couple of other\nbooks that you've written as well I'm\nsure they can all be found at Amazon be\nAmazon the most recent one I co-wrote\ncalled the big stick\nuh Tony endelman one of my certified Co\nthis is that's a it's a big book and you\nknow he ended up calling it the big\nstick because I do say that a lot\nbecause you know with guys you can take\nout the big stick it's uh what's the\nright word not condensation but it's\nit's it's a he's taken everything I've\ntaught in my courses my podcast\ndistillation maybe there distillation\ngreat word I'll have to write that one\ndown and use it again it's it covers you\nknow pretty much the the the whole\nof what I've been teaching for about 30\nyears so oh nice all in one place all in\none place I'll have to check that out\nany last words Robert oh thank you this\nwas fun I I I I liked a little bit of\npush and pull between the two of you you\nknow lot of times in interviews you know\nthe interviewer would just tee up a lot\nof softballs um I I could always tell\nwhen you're going I agree but I kind of\ndon't and I I I enjoyed that thank you\npeople want to see you shine so it makes\nsense but yeah I think we have more\ninteresting discussion if we can find\npoints of contrast that we can work\ntowards some sort of synthesis well and\neven some things maybe we don't agree on\nthen we might kind of actually we we\nboth might you know I never looked at it\nthat way I I love learning me too Robert\nthis was great man thanks so much for\naccepting my invitation it was good to\nmeet you I hope we can stay in touch\nsocially and uh we'll call that a wrap I\nwould welcome it
