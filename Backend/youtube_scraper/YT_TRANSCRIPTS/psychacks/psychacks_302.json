    "transcript": "so what does respect mean to a man first\nrespect means that I look up to you\nthere's an element of admiration to\nrespect it's not really possible to\nrespect the cross and it's certainly not\npossible to respect down remember we're\nnot talking about respect in the sense\nof basic human dignity men tend to\nassociate respect with admiration of\nExcellence so when a man respects a\nwoman he puts her on a pedestal this\ntends to create a lot of difficulties in\nthe courtship process this is because it\nputs the woman in the position of the\nadored and the Man in the position of\nthe adorer and this robs the woman of\nthe opportunity to have the more\nemotional experience in the relationship\nwomen are generally more emotional than\nmen and so they prefer to go to\nrelationships to feel to have emotional\nexperiences and they're going to feel\nmuch more if they're in the position of\nthe adorer not in the position of the\nadored"
