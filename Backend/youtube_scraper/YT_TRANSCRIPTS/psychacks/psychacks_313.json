    "transcript": "and it turns out that contrary to\npopular belief Chess Masters actually\ndon't think significantly more moves\nahead than the average player most are\nonly thinking two or three moves in\nadvance Master chess players\ndifferentiate themselves from average\nplayers in two main ways by identifying\npoor moves quickly and reliably thereby\nreducing the total move set under\nconsideration to just a few plausible\ncontenders and by recognizing patterns\nmore quickly and with less information\nthereby activating previously\nConsolidated move sequences and of\ncourse they're able to do both because\nthey've played thousands and thousands\nand thousands of games the same is\nbasically true of life you you can't\nfigure out what you should do with your\nlife just sitting in your room because\nwe only really learn Who We Are by\nexamining the choices that we make as we\nmove through life and the longer you sit\nin your room and ruminate the longer\nyou're depriving yourself of this\nprecious data about who you actually are"
