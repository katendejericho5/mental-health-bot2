    "video_title": "Women want the EMOTIONAL EXPERIENCE of love",
    "transcript": "men want that emotional experience\nalmost as much as women do but here's\nthe thing in my experience it's more\nimportant for a woman to have an\nemotional experience in a relationship\nthan it is for a man that's kind of like\nwhy the woman is there perhaps you've\nheard it said that you can make a woman\nfeel anything except bored and there's\nsome truth to that statement a woman who\nhates you might not leave but a woman\nwho feels indifferently is prob looking\nfor the door so if it's more important\nfor a woman to have an emotional\nexperience in a relationship then it's\nprobably better that she be the adorer\nbecause if she's the adored if she's up\nthere on that pedestal well that might\nfeel good for a while but it will\nactually get boring pretty quickly"
