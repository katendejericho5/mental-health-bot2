    "transcript": "well a lot of NOS I think are\nincreasingly becoming self-inflicted and\nmean you mentioned incels there's that\nstudy that I'm sure you're aware of that\nI think 30% of men under 30 have not had\nsex in the previous 12 months and that's\nI haven't let that sink in I've heard it\nbut that's that's that's incredible it's\nwild and that's like tripled in the last\ndecade it's gone up for women too but\nnot nearly at the same rate so I think a\nlot of men are seeing the stakes are\nreally high the barriers to entry are\nthey're\nreally difficult to overcome I am\nfeeling hopeless I'm going to try to\nturn a virtue out of a necessity and say\nokay I'm going to focus on other things\nin my life which might actually be a\nreally good strategy for men I\npersonally don't think that men should\neven think about settling down until\nthey're in their mid-30s mhm um because\nthe uh the game changes at 30 to begin\nto privilege men for the first time\nwomen have a significant advantage over\nmen in the 20s"
