    "transcript": "the fifth way that women disrespect men\nwithout realizing It Is by teasing\nteasing should be done very selectively\nif at all and it should never be done in\nfront of other people this is because\nteasing implies that you are so\ncomfortable in your position that you\nconsider a man to be a play thing with\nwhich you can do what you will with\ncomplete impunity it communicates that\nyou have nothing to fear from toying\nwith a man's status because you consider\nyourself well beyond the reach of any\npossible consequences this is placing\nyourself above a man which will be\nperceived as disrespect even more so if\nit's done publicly ladies you should\neven be cautious about certain forms of\nhumor like sarcasm in my opinion sarcasm\ntends to do much more harm than good in\na relationship this is because it is\noften used as a passive aggressive way\nto attack someone while retaining\nplausible deniability that that is not\nwhat you are doing"
