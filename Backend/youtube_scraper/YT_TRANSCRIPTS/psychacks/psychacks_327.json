    "transcript": "the fourth way that women disrespect men\nwithout realizing It Is by demanding\nexplanations the request to explain\nyourself is always a prerogative of the\nmore powerful of the less powerful it\nassumes not only that the more powerful\nparty has a right to the requested\nexplanation that it is the higher\nauthority that must be answered to but\nthat it is also empowered to judge the\nMerit of that EXP ation and to apply\npunishment as appropriate ladies you are\nnone of these things you are not a man's\nhigher authority you are not his judge\nand you are not his disciplinarian so do\nnot try to put yourself in these roles\nby the same token women are subject to\ndisrespecting men when they demand\nexplanations in the face of reasonable\nrequests"
