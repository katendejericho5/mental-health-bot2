    "video_title": "Romance was an HISTORICAL PHENOMENON",
    "transcript": "now because romance was actually a\nhistorical phenomenon it originated in\nthe south of France in the 15th century\nwe know who invented it men invented it\nmore specifically the chivalric Knights\nof that time and place and these men\ninvented it for them for men not for\nwomen and they invented romance in an\nattempt to compete with the rich and\npowerful men of their time for access to\nthe best women and this is because if a\nguy couldn't convince a woman that he\nhad something special something\nintangible that the king didn't have\nthere's no way he's getting laid the\ntruth about romance is that it's a\nstrategy that lower status men have\nadopted in their attempt to compete\nsuccessfully with higher status men for\nwomen this is also why romance is a\nyoung man's game because most young men\ndon't have anything to offer women"
