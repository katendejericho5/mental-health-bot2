    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how women\ndisrespect men without realizing it\nbursting the bubble so this is the\nsecond installment in a two-part episode\nfor the ladies I'm here to help you\nunderstand how you might be getting in\nyour own way with respect to your\nrelationships with men in the first\nepisode I briefly discussed three ways\nin which women inadvertently disrespect\nMen by assuming inappropriate power over\ntheir lives and they do this among other\nways through inappropriate questioning\ngranting permission and infantilizing\nsurveillance all of these behaviors\nposition the woman above the man which\nwill be perceived as disrespect and will\ntypically instigate conflict in the\nrelationship why because men For Better\nor For Worse typically don't simply\nallow other people to exercise\nunauthorized power over them they rise\nup\nand it's their willingness and ability\nto do so that more or less keeps things\nfree and safe ladies you probably\nwouldn't mind if your man rose up to\nchallenge the bullies and tyrants who\nthreaten your freedom and safety by\nusurping more power to themselves than\nis appropriate take care that you\nyourself do not assume more power than\nis warranted in your own\nrelationships so let's now return to our\ndiscussion on how women disrespect men\nwithout realizing it the idea here is to\ncall women's attention to the ways in\nwhich they may be inadvertently\nsabotaging their\nrelationships they want with the men\nthey want to have them with as before\nI'm not saying that women have a moral\nor ethical responsibility to refrain\nfrom these behaviors I'm saying that\nrefraining from these behaviors will\nsignificantly increase the likelihood\nthat they will achieve their\nrelationship goals so let's get to it\nthe fourth way that women disrespect men\nwithout realizing It Is by demanding\nexplanations the request to explain\nyourself is always a prerogative of the\nmore powerful of the less powerful it\nassumes not only that the more powerful\nparty has a right to the requested\nexplanation that it is the higher\nauthority that must be answered to but\nthat it is also empowered to judge the\nMerit of that explanation and to apply\npunishment as appropriate ladies you are\nnone of these things you are not a man's\nhigher authority you are not his judge\nand you are not his disciplinarian so do\nnot try to put yourself in these roles\nby the same token women are subject to\ndisrespecting men when they demand\nexplanations in the face of reasonable\nrequests think about it if your boss\nwere to give you an assignment\nbut you refused to comply with the\nrequest until he provided sufficient\nrationale for why this needs to be done\nand why this is in the best interest of\nthe company and why you're the right\nperson for the job and hey did you\nconsider doing it this way instead I'd\nrather do it this way that is if you\nkept demanding explanations for why you\nshould do what was requested of you then\nNot only would you be a very difficult\nperson to work with but you would come\noff as insubordinate as well it is for\nleaders who are appro appropriately\nauthorized to give orders to do their\npart and it is for followers who are\nappropriately authorized to execute them\nto do their part when this happens there\nis order and Harmony when this doesn't\nhappen there is disorder and chaos and\nthis is the result when reasonable\nrequests from appropriately authorized\nleaders are questioned ignored or\nselectively satisfied of course it is\nalways possible and necessary for\nfollowers to disregard or disobey\nrequests from their leaders when these\nrequests violate the orders of an even\nhigher\nauthority however these requests will\nlikely be few and far\nbetween now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also go to my\nwebsite and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nmessage using the venmo link provided\nI'm doing it this way because I receive\n100% of your donations if we go through\nvenmo uh I appreciate your support it\nkeeps all of this running thank you very\nmuch and finally the fifth way that\nwomen disrespect men without realizing\nIt Is by teasing teasing should be done\nvery selectively if at all and it should\nnever be done in front of of other\npeople this is because teasing implies\nthat you are so comfortable in your\nposition that you consider a man to be a\nplay thing with which you can do what\nyou will with complete impunity it\ncommunicates that you have nothing to\nfear from toying with a man's status\nbecause you consider yourself well\nbeyond the reach of any possible\nconsequences this is placing yourself\nabove a man which will be perceived as\ndisrespect even more so if it's done\npublicly ladies you should even be\ncautious about certain forms of humor\nlike sarcasm in my opinion sarcasm tends\nto do much more harm than good in a\nrelationship this is because it is often\nused as a passive aggressive way to\nattack someone while retaining plausible\ndeniability that that is not what you\nare doing in many cases it's not only\nhurtful it's\ncowardly if you have a problem with your\nman find a way to bring it to his\nattention directly and respectfully\ndon't hide behind a poorly veiled\nattempt at humor this is a form of\ncontempt which is just poison for\nrelationships remember you can say\nsomething once that another person might\nremember for the rest of his life so\nthink things through before you open\nyour\nmouth all right so those are five ways\nin which women are subject to\ndisrespecting men unintentionally all of\nwhich involve the inappropriate\nusurpation of power to some degree think\nabout it not only would you not do these\nthings to someone of higher status or\nauthority you wouldn't even do them to a\nor an equal either ladies let's hope\nthat you're not demanding your\ngirlfriends explain themselves to you or\ninterrogating your co-workers these\nbehaviors only appear across powerful\ndifferentials and in most case\nsignificant power differentials from\nhigh to low and just to respond to the\ninevitable criticism of these episodes\nI'm not arguing that men are inherently\nabove you and have a right to do these\nthings to you they don't these behaviors\nare\ndisrespectful irrespective of whether a\nwoman does them to a man or a man does\nthem to a woman I don't do these things\nto the women I've dated though I have\nencountered many women who for whatever\nreason believe it is their right or\ntheir privilege to do them to\nme they were not correct in this belief\nin my experience men who are generally\nmuch more comfortable navigating power\ndifferentials in hierarchical\nArrangements typically already\nunderstand that these behaviors are\ndisrespectful men understand that they\ncan't disrespect others with impunity\nand they learn this because there are no\nprotections for men\nunfortunately many women who enjoy\nsocial and cultural protections that men\ndo not apparently haven't learned some\nof these things yet maybe they didn't\nhave a strong father figure in the home\nto teach them these things in any case\nI'm here to help fill the Gap ladies if\nyou do any of these five things you are\nviolating the unbreakable rule\nthis puts your relationship on Shaky\nGround at best as a result you may need\nto choose between these behaviors and a\npeaceful and enduring relationship with\na man unfortunately you won't be able to\nhave both one of them has got to go\nwhich one is up to\nyou now let's model the treatment we\nwish to receive by keeping those\ncomments respectful what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below and if\nyou've gotten this far you might as well\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel member with perks like the\npriority review
