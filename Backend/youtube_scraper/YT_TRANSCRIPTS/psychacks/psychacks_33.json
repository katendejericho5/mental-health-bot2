    "transcript": "the belief of ideological feminism is a\na woman is a boss and she should be able\nto have everything it just isn't true\nlike nobody can have everything because\ngetting anything requires generally\ngiving up other things if anything just\ntime and opportunity when you choose one\npath you foreclose many other paths and\nit's very difficult to have everything\ntradeoffs again it's trade-offs and\nunfortunately like I said earlier a lot\nof women do things in my opinion in the\nwrong order in that they prioritize\nlet's say their career in their 20s and\nthen once they become financially\nestablished they turn around to saying\nokay now I want to have kids and a\nlong-term partner at 35 when it's much\nmore difficult to get that on the other\nhand if they were to prioritize\npotentially getting a husband from 20 to\n25 and when they reach 35 they feel like\nthey've missed out on being an employee\nthey could probably re-enter the job\nmarket y but at 35 if they've been an\nemployee their whole adult lives and\nthey feel like now they are missing out\non motherhood it's it's harder"
