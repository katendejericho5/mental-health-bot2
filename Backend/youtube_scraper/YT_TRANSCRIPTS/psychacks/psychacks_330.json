    "transcript": "the second way that women disrespect men\nwithout realizing it is through granting\npermission in general we have to ask\npermission of those who have the\nauthority to grant our requests this\nmeans that we act as though the good in\nquestion is actually in the possession\nof the authority who can grant us\npermission whether that's technically\ntrue or not taking possession of that\ngood without permission would be an\negregious Act of insubordination and\nthis is because permission only moves\nfrom the high to the low those with more\npower never have to ask permission of\nthose with less now the fact of the\nmatter is that unless you come to a\nmutual agreement to the contrary a man\nhas no obligation to ask your permission\nfor anything even if he's in a committed\nrelationship with you"
