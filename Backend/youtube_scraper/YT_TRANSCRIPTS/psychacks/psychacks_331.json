    "transcript": "the age-old argument that husbands and\nwives get into each other the the wife\nwants to talk the husband says okay I'm\nlistening she starts to talk about her\nproblems he starts to offer Solutions\nshe says I just want you to listen he\nsays well how is that going to help of\ncourse I'm listening that's why I'm\ntrying to solve your problem it's just I\njust need you to listen ah you know that\nkind of a thing so I think feminine\nproblem solving is more focused on\nemotional coping and masculine problem\nsolving is more focused on actually\naddressing the problem in an actionable\nway ideally you do both but I think that\nour normal associations with therapy\nis still 120 years old which is the\ntherapist is a screen he or she doesn't\ntalk very much um and you just vent and\npotentially arrive at some degree of\ninsight and the Insight is the master\nkey to solve whatever difficulty you're\ndealing with and I don't think that's\ntrue either"
