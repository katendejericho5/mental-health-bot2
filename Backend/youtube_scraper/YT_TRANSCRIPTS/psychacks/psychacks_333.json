    "transcript": "hi everyone I am very excited to be once\nagain sitting down with Dr Sean Smith my\nfriend and colleague Sean thanks for\njoining us today Ryan it's good to see\nyou again and um congratulations on all\nthe success of the channel it's it's\njust blowing up and as it should oh\nthanks man yeah it's been kind of a a\nbanner year for psyx and I'm cautiously\noptimistic about the\nfuture I'm not cautiously optimistic I'm\njust plain old optimistic I think you're\ngoing to hit a million I I predict by\nthe end of the year before then probably\nwell before then I hope I can handle the\nthe success the celebrity yeah something\nlike that um do you get recognized when\nyou go out on the streets no I'm a\nmaster of of being the grain man and and\nI can I can walk through a crowd and and\nit's like I was never there and I kind\nof prefer it that way there are\ndefinitely pros and cons to one's\nability to blend in right yeah well one\nof the reasons why I wanted to have you\non the show today besides just catching\nup is I want people to know that you've\nwritten yet another book which number of\nbook is this now Sean you've written at\nleast three right I think this might be\nsix I know I've read three books in my\nlife and I've written six I think yeah\nthat's Quite a feat that you've written\nwell one of them was The Hungry\nCaterpillar so I don't I don't know if\nwe count that one so six books one of my\nall-time favorite books in the space is\nthe Tactical guide to women and your\nnewest book is right here it's called\ngatekeeper and I think we can consider\nthis something of a followup to Tactical\nguide do you think that's fair yeah\nalthough you know I think about it as\nthe book that I probably should have\nwritten first because it's much more\nabout um you the reader and the\nrelationship patterns that that you're\non course to uh keep enacting unless\nunless you make a different decision but\nyeah it's it's a followup to the\nTactical guide was there something that\nwas left unsaid in the Tactical guide\nthat necessitated this book yeah there\nthere was the Tactical guide and I you\nknow it's nice when you can look back on\na book that book's about 5 years old now\nI think or six and it's nice when you\ncan look back at a book and not hate it\num because you you look at at least for\nme if you look at something you've done\nin the past I tend to see nothing but\nthe flaws and I certainly see flaws in\nthe Tactical guide but I also still\nthink it's it's a good book it's quality\nproduct and then apparently the market\nagrees with me and so I'm pleased with\nthat book that book focused a lot more\non the character of the women that\nyou're bringing into your world and\ntouched a little bit on on the\nrelationship Dynamics gatekeeper is much\nmore about men guarding their own future\nlooking at their past determining where\nthey're headed unless they if they stay\ncourse or change or change course and\nthe the type of relationships that they\nwere taught about that they're going to\ncontinue but it's not a lot of\npsychologist relationships speak it's\nvery nuts and Bol hey this is here this\nis how things work these are the\npitfalls these are some of the um the\nthe ways I've seen men approaching\nrelationships throughout my 20 years of\nof training and practice here's what\nI've seen work here's what I've seen not\nwork so well and uh you sort of a nuts\nand bolts guide to making sure that you\ndon't destroy your future with the wrong\nrelationship and yeah that's about it\nokay so it's on some level not enough\nsimply to avoid toxic women who manifest\nred flags in the relationship like\nobviously that's desirable but that's\nnot sufficient to securing a highquality\nsecure long-term relationship well\nthere's an inherent um problem with red\nflag list and everybody has frag red\nflag lists and you should have red flag\nlists but the problem with them is is\nthat you can memorize 50 red flags and\nthen you can get blindsided by number 51\nthat you never even thought of and so\nthe alternative to that is knowing\nyourself and and understanding how you\noperate in relationships because that\nmakes your radar bulletproof if you know\nwhere your strengths and vulnerabilities\nare in in the way you invite people into\nyour life then you don't need to walk\naround with a list you know a bunch of\nbullet lists in your head you can you\ncan examine the Dynamics as they unfold\nand make good decisions you think it's\npossible for a man to get that kind of\naccurate self- knowledge about what\nreally works for him in a relationship\nwithout being in relationships nope I\ndon't so does that besp speak that there\nmight be some sort of asymmetry between\nmen and women that in order for men to\nhave successful relationships they kind\nof need to have experience in the sexual\nMarketplace in a way that maybe women\ndon't that's an interesting question in\nthe way that women don't yeah I suppose\nin the sense that men and women are\nlooking for slightly different things in\ngeneral and so yeah there there's always\nthat difference\nbut I'm of the mind that we get good at\nwhat we practice and so if a if a\nguy wants to have a relationship the\ntype of relationship where he's building\nsomething with another woman and I have\nno agenda I don't care if guys get\nmarried don't get married you just your\nlife you do what you want I'm not in the\nbusiness of advising people how they\nshould live their lives I'm just in the\nbusiness of if this is what you want if\nyou want to build something with a woman\na family an Empire whatever it is that\nlet's look at what works and let's look\nat what doesn't work and so in order to\nbe good at and skilled at relationships\nis like being good and skilled at\nanything else if you're going to be good\nat tennis you got to play tennis if\nyou're going to be good at\nrelationships you better know how\nrelationships work is and I don't you\nknow there's there's so many guys out\nthere that get into relationships and\nthis was me at one point in my life\nwhere it's like you've you've bought\nthis high-end vehicle but you have no\nidea how it works why not learn how the\nthing works before you try to drive it\nand that's where my stance on\nrelationships if you if you want a\nrelationship then figure out how they\nwork which means figuring out how you\nwork\nso that makes that makes a lot of sense\nto me besides the relative lack of\nexperience what do you think is\nmen's obstacles towards that kind of\naccurate self- knowledge about what\nworks for them in\nrelationships the things that the common\nobstacles are the mostly the things that\nthey grew up around so the relationships\nthat they saw among the adults as they\nwere growing up the relationships that\nthey experienced with those adults the\nrelationships that they experience with\nother kids that's really you know when\nyou're when you're young the\nrelationship patterns set in and then\nyou start flying on autopilot like\nlearning how to tie your shoe you have\nto put a lot of energy into learning how\nto tie your shoe first and then\neventually you're not even thinking\nabout tying your sh you're having a\nconversation while you're tying your\nshoe and that's sort of how the\nrelationship patterns unfold as well you\nspend a lot of time upfront figuring\nthem out and then you go on autopilot\nuntil you decide to turn the autopilot\noff and and take things into your own\nhands yeah I think that fits with my\npersonal and clinical experience we get\nthese we s i could call them love\ntemplates or relationship templates from\nobserving the adult relationships\nclosest to us when we're young typically\nour parents and I think the natural\ntendency is to inappropriately\novergeneralize from that limited data\nset that this relationship that I\nobserved or experien is basically how\nrelationships are or should\nbe and people more or less move out into\nthe sexual Marketplace in their young\nadulthood with that assumption I think\nuntil they experience sufficient\nfriction or failure or rejection or\ndifficulty and potentially only\nafter years of it not working do they\nentertain the possibility that their\nfundamental models about relationships\nor their assumptions about women might\nbe\nflawed do you think that that's fair\nyeah and by the time they have that\nrealization they've been practicing\nthose patterns over and over and over\nagain and solidifying\nthem so is there a way to\nrealistically um help young guys get\nthere faster without having to go\nthrough this process of Pain by which\nthey ultimately disabuse themselves of\ntheir models of relationships I think\nthere is that's why I wrote both of\nthese books um because you know one of\nthe first things I noticed in my\npractice and I started off my practice\nworking in particular I worked a lot\nwith anxiety disorders and I started\nworking with couples too because that\nwas really fun but you I started\nnoticing guys making these blunders in\ntheir love lives that just destroyed\ntheir lives we've all seen we've all\nseen it and it's not fun for women\neither when a relationship doesn't work\nout and so that's why I started looking\nat this data and and putting these books\ntogether but I do think that there's a\nway to avoid the mistakes that other\npeople have made and primarily it is to\nlook at the mistakes that other people\nhave made compare them to yourself and\nthat's a good starting point you know at\nleast you don't need to repeat the\nmistakes that other people have made you\ncan look at the good decisions that\nthey've\nmade\nyeah I'm glad you said that I'm working\non my own book right now and I talk\nabout in any certain game it's generally\nbetter in the beginning to learn how not\nto blunder than it is to make better\nmoves because 50 fantastic moves in a\nrow can be undone by a single blunder so\nwhat you think might be some of the\nbiggest blunders that tend to Blindside\nmen early on in their dating histories\nwell there there's blunders and there's\nlack of knowledge and blunders are\nthings like moving in too early shacking\nup and getting entangled with somebody\nwho turns out to be kind of a disaster\nthat would be a blunder um but it might\nbe a blunder because you don't know any\nbetter so in the realm of things that\nwe're not taught there's what do good\nrelationships look like and so many\npeople out there have no idea just the\nthe basic bare barebones minimum of what\nto seek in a woman which is what the\ntactical guide was about and the\nbarebones minimum of what to seek in a\nrelationship which is what the the what\ngatekeeper is about because you're\nbringing this entity you know this\nrelationship into your life it's like a\njob it's like a house it's like it's a\nmajor commitment and it has huge\nimplications and we're just most of us I\nwould venture to say almost all of us is\nparticularly men we're not giving it\nwe're not giving explicit lessons on\nhere's how you choose a woman here's how\nyou choose a relationship ship we kind\nof have to look around and try to figure\nout what works and so we're left with a\nlot of wordless Impressions about how\nrelationships function and when you\nstart to put words to what works and\nthen put words to what you're doing and\nthe principles by which you operate then\nsuddenly you can avoid those blunders\nand you can avoid the most of the things\nthat you were never taught because now\nyou're starting to put words to it\nstarting to figure it\nout I think maybe one of the reasons why\na lot of\nnever learned this is because the men\naround them didn't have the knowledge to\nimpart to them because right they were\nnever taught by their own fathers or\nuncles or friends yeah I think that 100%\nwe're in in an interesting moment where\nI think more than ever before that\ninformation is becoming more and more\nwidely available to men unfortunately at\nthe same time it's also mixed up with a\nhost of all kinds of information of\nvarious quality\nvalidity some of it is very low quality\nit's actually it's never been easier to\naccess this information in the history\nof the world but it might also\nparadoxically never be more difficult to\nfind it among all the low resolution\ninformation that is circulating yeah\nyeah that's a good point there's a lot\nof\nnoise all right\nso I think one of the main takeaways\nthat I got from reading the book\nis that sometimes you can have a woman\nwho is\nperfectly good like a but just not good\nfor\nyou that seems like it would be a very\nhard thing to walk away from especially\nif a guy up until that point has had\ndifficulty even meeting an engaging a\ndecent woman does that make sense yeah\nmakes a lot of sense\nI think one of the things that makes it\ndifficult for men to have\nstandards with respect to women in their\nrelationships in general is a lack of\noptionality would you agree a lack of\noptionality or a perceived lack of\noptionality\nor I don't know what's what's your\nthoughts on how much of it is perceived\nand how much of it is real in\ngeneral I think it's very rare for young\nmen to have actual optionality MH um the\nvast majority of young men don't have\nthe things yet that most women are\nselecting for in terms of a long-term\npartner we know that women tend to\nValue emotional maturity resources\nstatus prestige a stable lifestyle and\nalmost by definition when you're 22 you\ndon't have those things you might have\noptionality with respect to sexual\naccess if you have some game confidence\nand physical\nattractiveness but but most of those\nwomen won't consider you as a viable\noption for a long-term relationship\nwhich might be okay because a lot of 22y\nold guys don't want to settle down yet\nanyway um but I do think that that's\nwhere a lot of guys get trapped in their\nlate 20s which is when things start to\nshift with respect to the relative let's\nsay power imbalance between men and\nwomen in general is women are starting\nto kind of Their Stars starting to\ndecline whereas men's Stars continuing\nto R\nand potentially the first woman who\nshows any kind of real interest who\nseems to be decent and acceptable is the\nwoman that he ends up marrying and\ncommitting to in his late 20s or early\n30s well yep we've all seen it yeah and\nand I would add that yes it's normal\nthat men in in their early 20s don't\nhave these things necessarily that women\nare looking for I would add that that's\nnot new that's as old as Humanity\nokay so this is not a new problem for\nmen as far as I can tell it's not a new\nproblem so what do you make out of let's\nlet's kind of zoom out a little bit what\ndo you make of sort of the social moment\nin which it seems like more and more\nyoung men seem more and more hopeless\nand disenfranchised especially with\nrespect to dating and relationships yeah\nthat's that's a really complicated\nanswer and I I don't think there's one\nthing that we can point to and I when I\nwhen I Venture into social media and so\nforth I see people trying to pick the\none answer trying desperately to find\nyou know how do we solve this problem so\nthey'll point to tnder they'll point to\nfeminism they'll point to you know any\nnumber of things and say this is the\nreason young men are struggling and I\ndon't think it's a I think it's all of\nthe above I think there are many things\nthat men are struggling with right now I\nthink every generation in humanity has\nhad something that they were struggling\nagainst against not to minimize what\nguys are struggling with now um it's it\nis kind of rough out there and I know\nthat the online dating apps have really\ncomplicated things for young men how\nso what I I have been off I've been off\nthe market\nfor have you ever used online dating\napps or did you use your wife well\nbefore this happened no when no when I\nwas well I've been with my wife for 20\nsomething you know high 20s and we've\nbeen married for 25 G great but yeah\nthere was no there are no apps back then\nthere might have been the the first\nbeginnings of something like e-harmony\nbut doesn't matter when I'm hearing from\nyoung guys these days is that there is\nsort of this Marketplace I'm seeing two\nmarketplaces there there's a maybe we\ntalk about that a minute but there's\nthis marketplace where there's this\nonline you know these these online\ndating apps like Tinder and so forth\nBumble hinge where most men are\ntremendously\ndisadvantaged um because as far as I can\ntell the things that women look for\nbehaviorally don't really show up on\nthose ass particularly Tinder all it\nshows up on apps is on most apps is a\nlittle description and a picture as I\nunderstand it and so the things that\nwomen you know I might have been able to\nuse to my advantage when I was younger\nand I did use to my advantage things\nlike humor and and a little bit of\nswagger and um just the ability to to\nmake eye contact and sort of have a\nlittle game and a little bit of\nplayfulness that's very difficult to do\non an app I think it's harder to do or\nat least it requires a different set of\nskills yeah like I do think it's still\nimportant to show that you have Swagger\nbut you might have to do that indirectly\nthrough your pictures for example in a\nway that maybe you were going to do it\nwith your accessories and when you meet\nmet on a date in person or something\nlike or your\npersonality you can you go on a if you\nwent on a date back in my day back in\nthe you know early 1800s or whenever it\nwas you could um you know I could go on\na date with a woman and she wasn't just\nseeing me she was seeing how I\ninteracted with people she was seeing\nhow I carried myself she was seeing how\nI walked she was seeing how I dealt with\nthings like some some little thing not\ngoing right like all of those things\nmattered those are difficult to\nconvey those things might still matter\nto a woman and she might look for them\non a date but you still had to get that\ndate\nto begin with just like the guy on\nTinder to\nget access to the real life person so\nisn't kind of the same problem sort of\nbut I I think back in my day I wasn't\ncompeting with Tinder even if I hadn't\nbeen on Tinder if I was working\nsomeplace for example or I was doing a\nservice job and I was encountering all\nkinds of women um I wouldn't be\ncompeting with this silent enemy over\nhere called Tinder where her her\nattention is divided between the real\nworld and Tinder now we know that not\nevery woman's on Tinder it's a very\nactually very small percentage of the\npopulation is on Tinder but we we seem\nto blow that data way out of proportion\nbut my point being that the competition\nwas just different and I think it's much\nmore complicated these days well I think\neven more so than these traditional\ndating apps um maybe you've heard that\nthe biggest dating app in the world\nright now is Instagram according to many\nfolks because there are ways of\nsearching for folks and direct free\naccess to those people by just sliding\ninto their DMS so on some level because\nof social media even more so than\ntraditional dating apps men are\ncompeting against all men everywhere for\nany given local woman's attention and\naffections and that's that's very\ndifficult like it's hard enough to be a\nbig fish in a small pond it's next to\nimpossible to be the biggest fish in the\nbiggest pond like very very few men can\ndo that and they of course get the Lion\nShare of sexual opportunity in today's\nMarketplace in that Marketplace I think\nthere are two Marketplace well at least\ntwo marketplaces I think there's that\nOnline Marketplace which is not a\nsingular Marketplace because there are\nthe apps but then there's also meeting\npeople organically through social media\nyou know Twitter Facebook whatever it is\nthe way you might meet somebody\norganically in the real world so even\nthe Online Marketplace it's not just\nthat people are meeting each other with\nthe intention of hooking up or or you\nwith the intention of hooking up or a\nrelationship through an app they could\njust be they could just encounter each\nother and decide that they like each\nother that's one but then there's this\nother Marketplace that doesn't seem to\nget much pressed today which is the real\nworld because there are a lot of people\nwho aren't interested in the dating apps\nand they're not participating in that\nand that seems to be resemble much more\nthe traditional old pre- dating app\nMarketplace yeah but I think my\nunderstanding is that fewer and fewer\nmen are initiating and approaching women\nin in real life yeah uh whether it's set\nSingles bars or you know around the\nworkplace or in their friend groups so\nand women still\nseem entrenched in their unwillingness\nto approach men even men that they are\nattracted to and interested in forming\nrelationships with so it seems like the\nreal world marketplace is kind of on Ice\nthese days it kind of is and you could\nframe that as a bad thing and or or you\ncould frame it as an advantage if if I'm\nout there if I'm 25 and I know that none\nof the other guys are approaching anyone\nin real life or very few are approaching\nwomen in real life well and I've got a\nlittle bit of an edge I guess I would I\nwould agree with that I think on some\nlevel it's never been easier\nto be more confident and masculine in\nmost contexts for the vast majority of\nmen because a lot of that is going\nunderground a lot of that is going\nonline and so you actually have to make\nless of an effort than you ever had to\nin the past in order to beat out more of\nyour intersexual competition in real\nworld marketplaces I think it's\ndefinitely a skill set that's worth\nlearning for most guys yeah it's it's a\nskill set that generalizes once you get\nover that anxiety and it's a visceral\nanxiety that men have about approaching\nwomen because that rejection for most\nguys is is powerful and once you get\nover that you conquer that anxiety\nconquering anxiety is a skill that\ngeneralizes to other areas so the next\njob interview is going to be easier the\nnext public address is going to be\neasier you know everything gets a little\nbit easier when you conquer some piece\nof\nanxiety okay well let's also talk about\nwhy the possibility that relationships\nare down not simply because of\ncompetition from Instagram or online\ndating apps but because it might be\neasier and cheap cheaper to secure the\ngoods that people would traditionally\nsecure in relationships in other ways\nlike for example I did a consultation\nearlier this week with a guy\nwho's they were he was having an\nargument with his wife who apparently\ntold him that it wouldn't matter if they\nbroke up because he could be replaced by\nTinder and task\nrabbit and I that was a pretty cutting\nblow on her part but there might be some\ntruth to what she said yeah kind of kind\nof vicious if it was recounted correctly\num yeah but I I talk about this in an\nepisode in the past which is that it's\ncertainly necessary for women to have\nmen around like men build everything\nmore or less they make Society run they\ncreate the apps that on they create the\nphones and that bring all the goods that\nArms Reach to these women but it might\nno longer be necessary for women to have\na particular man in their life and\npotentially vice versa men might need a\nlot of women around to keep the\npopulation sustainable and Etc but they\nmight not need a single woman at least\nnot a single woman for the rest of their\nlives um how would you respond to that\nyeah I would say yeah it's you can get\nby on your own these days but most\npeople don't seem to want to most people\nseem to kind of like being in\nrelationships MH is that because\nthey get something from relationships\nthat they might not be able to get in\nthe marketplace otherwise I think we're\nwe're social animals and we want to be\nwe most of us want to be connected in\nsome way to some degree and you know\nsome people want to have families and\nkids and and they want to have that\nliveliness around them and they want to\nknow that when they hit 70 and 80\nthey'll be able to look back on some\nmeaningful connections and and have some\npeople around them hopefully that care\nabout them MH and yeah I don't know why\njust I guess you could get into\nevolutionary psychology and it's being\nattached to each other is what what\nhelps our species progress no that makes\nsense it I think it might be a tough\nsell for a lot of folks in their 20s\nthough I mean I'm 41 now I never thought\nI would live this long and you were\ntalking about looking back at 70 or 80\nwhich basically seems like an eternity\naway when you're in your early 20s yeah\nit is a tough sell for guys in their 20s\nbut luckily I'm not here to sell that\nbecause that would be a tough sell I\ncome in when where people are um\nstarting to build their relationships\nand they're trying not to destroy their\nlives yeah okay so uh that's some\ninteresting stuff about dating and\nrelationships from Sean um one of the\nthing I'm going to transition here okay\num one of the things that we discussed\nprior to this conversation was for me to\nreach out to my community to let them\nknow that I would be talking to you yeah\nwe did a group project yeah and to ask\nthem if they had any kinds of topics or\nquestions that they would enjoy the two\nof us discussing and we got nearly I\nthink 200 responses which I went through\nand I picked out some of the questions\nthat I personally felt would be most\ninteresting to discuss with you in\nparticular given your experience and\nskill set you want to give this a shot\nand discuss some of these topics from\nsome questions okay great I really liked\nthis one uh the comment read would love\nto know your personal experiences with\nwomen that made you feel very cared for\nand loved I want to do a good job caring\nfor the men around me so presumably from\na woman um she wants to know how do men\nfeel loved and cared for I think that's\na great question food and sex what's\nyour\nanswer I think those are are both good\nthings I I am a little bit more nuanced\nI feel cared for\nwhen when a woman shows that she's been\nlistening and paying attention in the\nsense\nthat if I'm talking\nabout to use a very prosaic example if I\nmention that one of my light bulbs have\nburned out the next time I see that\nwoman she's brought me a light bulb to\nreplace it with so it's it demonstrates\nthat she's paying attention and it\ndemonstrates that she wants to make my\nlife better in an instrumental Way by\nhelping me both make my lifestyle more\ncomfortable and helping me move in the\ndirection of My overall mission in life\nand to do that without being asked or\ntold to do it it's just like she's just\nthere to help out and to chip in when\nit's necessary that makes me feel very\nloved and cared for yeah this this is\none that um I struggled with more more\nthan others because I as when I read\nthis question I started thinking back on\non my career and uh what have men told\nme about what works in terms of you know\nfeeling cared for and what doesn't work\nand I had a hard time identifying themes\nI would say one theme and this is this\nis a don't this is not a do and don'ts\naren't as helpful dos are more helpful\nbut you know don't ride our asses is one\nof the things that that I think I've\nheard as a trend throughout my career\nmeaning you you're you're walking down\nthe street you see attractive woman she\ncatches your eye you don't you don't\nwant to pursue her she just catches your\neye because you're a man and then to\nhave to um answer for for just having a\nsort of normal biological reaction to a\nwoman and and then turning your\nattention back to your own woman that\nthat being an example or you know just\nsort of\nnagging and uh making things difficult\nand harder than they need to be I think\nthat that is a trend that I have heard\nover the last 20 years from men is we do\nnot feel most men do not feel cared for\nwhen a woman is making things harder\nthan they need to be the flip side of\nthat I think the thing that um the flip\nside of that coin is being someone who's\nPleasant to come home to and that goes\nboth ways like but if you're a woman and\nyou want to make your man feel careful\njust be pleasant to come home to let him\nlook forward to walking in the door and\ngetting a hug and a pleasant greeting\nand a kind word um that goes a\ntremendously long way and so that that'd\nbe my answer I guess I I I think that\nalready assumes a more traditional\nrelationship though I I guess in that\nframework the woman is at home waiting\nfor the man to return from work\nmetaphorically speaking maybe you're\nhome and she comes home and but the\npoint is that when you reunite that it's\na pleasant experience and it's not\nsomething that he's dreading because he\nknows that he's in trouble for some\nstupid thing or whatever that he's in\ntrouble for some stupid thing thing or\nthat he has to serve as a surrogate\ntherapist or counselor to listen to her\nvent about her day or to provide\nemotional support for you know dealing\nwith another work-related frustration\nEtc I I think that in general it's a\ngood idea to bring as little stress and\nnegativity as possible into\nyour primary relationship and if you\nhave confidence or therapists or close\nfriends to kind of do that kind of\nemotional processing there to keep the\nspace between the two of you as clean\nand pristine as\npossible do you think that that's fair\nI'm thinking about that one I'm thinking\nabout you know handling problems\ntogether and I I think if there's a\ndistinction to be drawn there it would\nbe that it's impotent complaining and\nendless complaining versus um a woman\nsaying you're my man I need to bend your\near for a little bit maybe I need your\nguidance at the end of this maybe I just\nneed you to listen but there being some\nbalance between the the all the bad news\nand all the good news and that there's\nmore positivity far more positivity in\nthe relationship than negativity and\nthat if there's a stream of of endless\nproblems from work for example that\nthere can be some solution to that that\nwe're not going to spend the rest of our\nlives just me listening to you complain\nabout work that yeah I'll listen to you\ntry to make sense of the problem and try\nto work it out but if this is the rest\nof our lives you know you complaining\nand me sitting here absorbing no that's\nthat's not going to work and it wouldn't\nwork the other way either okay cool I\nthink that was an interesting response\nto that question shall we move on yeah\nall right number two I got do you think\ndepression is actually a mental illness\nor just a temporary condition that gets\nway overdiagnosed in talking with\nclients do you notice a big difference\nin how it affects men versus\nwomen this one got me kind of fired up\nyou you want me to start on this one\nyeah absolutely what you have to say\nwell first of all let's come up with a\nan operational definition of depression\nso when researchers look at animals and\nand they're looking at depression in\nanimals the way they measure depression\nin animals is does the animal slow down\nso it does does it do less of the things\nthat that animal normally does sniffing\nexploring grooming eating humping\nwhatever all the all the things it does\nwhen the animal starts to get smaller in\nits behaviors and we call that depressed\nand I think that's not a bad way to\nthink about depression in humans that\nour behavioral repertoire shrinks a\nlittle bit our world gets smaller we get\nsmaller now for men in particular it\ndoesn't always look sad and slow and\ndepressed with men it can often look\ndepression can often look irritated and\nagitated and and sort of energetic but\neven then you see a diminishing a\ndiminishment in functioning at work in\nrelationships and the way they take care\nof themselves so this idea that um\ndepression shrinks you down and makes\nyou less than than you could be and that\nyou want to be I think is a fair fair\nenough definition for discussion would\nyou would you go with\nthat I think those are the most reliable\nsigns of depression the vegetative signs\nI think is what they tend to call them I\nalso think that male depression tends to\nmanifest itself as irritability or\nrestlessness I think that that's fair\nwhich which I'll I'll just interject\nhere that that makes it hard to\nrecognize because if a guy's acting like\nkind of a dick it's hard to to recognize\nthat he might actually be suffering but\ngo ahead yeah many angry men are\nactually very sad men yeah and I think\nit's often easier for men to access\nanger and it because on some level it is\ndeceptively it gives them this deceptive\nsense of a more powerful experience I\nmean anger is like\ninflating uh I think it's deceptive\nbecause when you actually give into the\nanger you're surrendering your own locus\nof control and whatever has succeeded in\nmaking you angry is now like the Matador\nwaving the cape and you are potentially\nthe charging bull and that generally\ndoesn't end up very well for the bull at\nthe end of the\nmatch okay so I think we agree on those\ndefinitions okay\nso the next the next point I guess would\nbe that I think we have collectively as\na society been duped into thinking about\ndepression as a disease that you catch\nit's even in the question um is it just\nan illness or a temporary condition so\nwe we talk about depression as if it is\nthis thing you catch like\nchlamydia and it's largely through the\nefforts of and they're not evil efforts\nnecessar neily but through the efforts\nof pharmaceutical companies and\ninsurance companies that we think of\ndepression as a disease but you and I\nknow that depression can be secondary to\nany number of things it could be\nsecondary to physical problems like um a\nthyroid problem or bad diet or lack of\nexercise it can be it can come from\nongoing problems in your life it can\ncome from something that happened 30\nyears ago that you don't even think\nabout anymore but it's thinking about\nyou and it's driving your behavior so\ndepression can come from all sorts of\ndifferent situations which makes it a\nsymptom not a disease when you think\nabout it as as a symptom like a fever a\nfever can be caused by a thousand\ndifferent things but a fever isn't a\ndisease a fever is just a symptom and so\nif you frame it as a symptom rather than\na disease then you get a couple of\noptions and the first one is is\ndifficult that is that you know this is\na symptom of something going on so you\nget to do the hard work of diagnosing it\nand then coming up with the treatment\nplan and then following through on that\ntreatment plan and that's a lot of work\nand one of the things that really sucks\nabout being depressed is that it sucks\nyour energy so you don't want to do\nthese things that you you that you could\ndo under this first plan the second plan\nis you take a pill and in my 20 years of\ndoing this work it seems to me that\nfamily physicians in particular\nwonderful people in general but hand out\nssris like their candy and they don't\ntalk about the tradeoffs now I'm not\nopposed to ssris they're just a tool but\nevery tool has its tradeoff and and you\nknow every time I talk about the\ntrade-offs of SSR somebody gets deeply\npersonally offended so if you found\nssr's useful good you know go with that\nbut Physicians will hand this stuff out\nand they don't talk about the fact that\nthere is no free lunch when it comes to\nneurochemistry every time you Tinker\nwith your brain chemistry your brain\nadjust and so with ssris the way your\nbrain adjusts is by downregulating the\nsynapses that are affected by the SSRI\nand so you get a window and in my\nexperience it's 6 months 12 months\nsomething like that where the fever is\nreduced got a little more energy and the\nproblem will either resolve or you get\nthe energy to resolve it you figure out\nwhat's going on you know ssris can be\nLifesavers in that sense that they take\nthe edge off enough that they can get\nyou moving or if that doesn't happen\nthen you're left as that window closes\nwith doing what so many people do which\nis switching to another medication or\nyou stay on the medication just to avoid\nthe withdrawal of going off of the\nmedication and so some people have been\non medications for years it's not really\ndoing anything because their their brain\nlong ago went back back to Baseline but\nthey're just avoiding that withdrawal\nand so I'm just going to I'll close this\nout by saying depression is a symptom\nyou'll get a lot further thinking about\nit as a symptom than you will as a\ndisease yeah I think that was all well\nsaid anybody who really wants to get\ninto this issue in depth I would\nrecommend Whitaker's anatomy of an\nepidemic which was written maybe 10 or\n15 years ago and it's a mck breing\nexpose of this pharmaceutical Industries\ninfluence in the evolution of our\nconceptualization of mental illness\nabout a hundred years ago Depression was\nseen as more or less a temporary\ncondition one of the nasty Secrets is\nthat most of the illnesses that are\npopulated in the\nDSM including depression tend to\nspontaneously remit even in the absence\nof therapeutic treatment or\npharmaceutical Intervention which\nbasically means I think with depression\nthat the vast majority of depressions go\naway by by themselves in 6 to 10 months\nnow it can be a very challenging dark\ndifficult 6 to 10 months and so\npotentially the ssris or other\nmedications can elevate a person's mood\nand give them the energy and Clarity to\ntake constructive action during that\nwindow of time that you dis discussed\nbut you're absolutely correct is\nthat changing your brain chemistry over\ntime creates\nsometimes irreversible changes in your\nneuroanatomy and your\nneurophysiology and that once the\nmedication is discontinued A syndrome\nthat in many respects can mimic the\ninitial\nproblem reappears and too often\naccording to Whitaker this rebound\ndepression gets misdiagnosed as the\noriginal depression returning as opposed\nto let's say a withdrawal Syndrome from\nthe psychiatric medication yeah and of\ncourse in in many in many cases the\nindividual then goes back on either that\nSSRI or an equivalent medication and\nthis the problem is just sort of\nworsened over time now I do agree that\ndepression\nis largely a symptom and it can be a\nsymptom of many different things the\nthing that I think depression is a\nsymptom of in the vast majority of cases\nin\nmen is it's a symptom of being low\nstatus and I don't think you mention\nthat it's like it's possible for a man\nto be confident and contented and happy\nand clear when he has no sexual\noptionality when he has no money or a\nsecure livelihood or a\ncomfortable lifestyle it's possible but\nit's extremely difficult to be happy and\ncontented and confident under those\nconditions and I think that is the\nnatural state of things when most young\nmen enter into the world is there the\nlowest person on every totem pole women\ntypically don't want them because they\ndon't yet have the things that women\nfilter for in their selection process\nand most men don't really want them\nbecause they don't have skills they\ndon't have experience\nthey're kind of a liability they can\nonly be helped they can't really help\nthe team in their mission so it's very\nvery difficult for a lot of young men\nand they don't yet have a place in the\nworld and I think that their depression\nis often a manifestation of\nthat low status and the the issue there\nis that can become like a trap like the\nif the low status creates the depression\nand depression is associated with let's\nsay hopelessness and despair that young\nman May then inappropriately\novergeneralized and say it's always\ngoing to be this way there's no way out\num it's all [ __ ] anyway you can't do\nanything about this but that could very\nwell be the depression talking and we\nsee this in you know non-human primate\nstudies that as male primates Elevate in\ntheir stat respective status hierarchies\na lot of those vegetative symptoms of\ndepression tend to disappear\nwhat do you think about that yeah I\nthink you I'm I'm with you 100% on how\ndifficult it is to be a young man and I\nthink women have no way of comprehending\nhow difficult it is to be a young man\nand it's only a handful of men who seem\nto remember how difficult it was being a\nyoung man but so much of the behavior\nthat you see from young guys where\nthey're they're being Reckless and\nthey're they're abusing substances and\nthey're they're out causing trouble some\nof that is just because they're they're\nKnuckleheads and their brains haven't\ngrown in yet but some some of it is\nbecause of this situation they're in\nwhere the world is demanding that they\nstart providing the world probably\ndemanded a long time ago you said you\nstart giving more than you take Mister\nbut he doesn't have the skills to do it\nhe doesn't have he doesn't have the\njuice he doesn't have the influence and\nhe's he's sort of stuck and he's\nfloundering for a few years and that's\nwhere the places like the military are\nreally good for a young guy because they\nsay all right you got a you got a\npurpose starting today and that jump\nstarts that sense of having a purpose in\nlife I can see that not just a purpose\nbut you also have a set a Cadre of\ncomrades as well so you have Team you\ngot a hierarchy you got a place in the\nhierarchy even if it's at the bottom if\nyou know where you are and you know what\nyour job is that's good enough for 99%\nof young guys it can be difficult but\nalso I think in those hierarchies where\nyou are very clear about where you stand\nthere's also also there's also generally\na pathway\nthat everyone understands to to move up\nthat hierarchy as well yeah like most\nfolks know what it takes to go from an\nE6 to an E5 when they're in those sort\nof military hierarchies yeah if you go\non Twitter Twitter um or Facebook or\nInstagram those places places like that\nyou will see a lot of men telling other\nmen you don't need therapy you need to\ngo the gym and I think this is the\nproblem that they're trying to solve\nthey're trying to talk to young guys and\nsay you got to get moving because guys\nget immobilized in this state and if you\ncan get yourself to the gym and at least\nstart seeing some progress there then\nyou're starting to develop a skill set\nof establishing progress and and I'm\nconvinced that when I hear guys say you\ndon't need therapy you need the gym well\nokay sometimes you need more than one\noption in life some you know therapy is\ngood for some problems of gyms good for\nother problems but I'm I'm convinced\nthat it's guys trying to help other guys\njust get out of this morass that we get\nstuck in in our early early 20s yeah I\nthink it's much harder it's not\nimpossible but it's much harder to get\ndepressed when you're successful when\nyou have built a life worth living when\nyou have found your purpose and you're\nenabled and incentivized every day to\nmove in the direction of that purpose\nabsolutely yeah and I think\nthat it it may even be difficult for\nyoung men who are mired in depression to\nwork towards that for another reason\nwhich is that it can be\ncomforting\nto remain admired in the\ninertia one of the things that I\nremember experiencing when I was younger\nis I was really cautious about investing\nin\nmyself and building a life worth living\nbecause I knew I was afraid of having it\nbe taken away which felt like it would\nbe even more painful and difficult than\nif if I never had it to begin with does\nthat make sense\nyeah so yeah don't try you can't get\nhurt\nyeah that wasn't true like once I\nfinally made the decision to go for it\nand invest in a career and to take self\naccountability and to improve my\nlifestyle my life only improved and even\nthough I know on some level that\neverything I've been given will be taken\naway from me one day I don't in any way\nwhat soever feel like that is a\nliability with respect to the life I\nwould otherwise have been\nliving it's hard to see that though when\nyou're stuck in in those early 20s late\nteens you you don't have any context to\nto put that in you know it's easy\nrelatively easy for us to look back and\nyou know I have a similar story where I\nI was stuck for a while and had stuck\nfor my own reasons and now I can look\nback and see well I shouldn't have been\nstuck you know I should have had a much\nbigger mindset than I did well that's\ninteresting so what personally got you\non stock do you\nremember not not a single thing\ncertainly part of it was being on a team\num one of my first jobs I was I was a\nmechanic at this place I was a mechanic\ntrainee I was nothing I was just\nlearning how to turn wrenches and but I\nwas a part of a team there were like 10\nguys managing these machines and just\nbeing part of that team I got some hard\nlessons about what it is to be on a team\nsome some hard lessons about what it is\nto be in the hierarchy and develop some\ngreat relationships with these guys and\nI think that placing myself in that\nsituation where I was accountable to\nother men that was a huge experience for\nme H I think for me it was observing\nsome of my close friends relative\nsuccess in my friend group I was\nprobably one of the latest bloomers and\nI was\nstill living a bgeo hedonistic lifestyle\nin my late 20s when I was working as a\nactor in New York City\nbut by that time a lot of my friends had\neither finished law school or medical\nschool they had secure well-paying jobs\nthey weren't living in\nthe subsidized housing that I was in\nBrooklyn they were they had nice\nApartments where they were buying houses\nthey had\nstable relationships that had a high\nfuture potential for family and\nstability like they they had a lot of\ngood things in life and hanging out with\nthese folks became increasingly awkward\nto be honest it's like these guys\ninvited me out to for some drinks\nbecause they were making money they\nwanted to go to the place with like the\n$15 cocktails which was way outside of\nmy um budget and I felt increasingly\nawkward because I didn't want to be the\nguy who dictated where we went because\nof my limited means and I certainly\ndidn't want my friends to be buying me\ndrinks out of pity for instance so or I\nwould go over to their houses and my\nfriends never you know rubbed it in\ntheir face when when they were improving\ntheir lives or becoming more and more\nsuccessful but I felt this widening Gap\num between me and them which I\nwas like I I I didn't want to ad admit\nthat I I was feeling envious of some of\nthe things that they were able to\nachieve and I hated that I felt that way\nbecause my friends I like my friends I\nwanted to be 100% completely happy for\ntheir success but there was this there\nwas this\nunintentional emotional response that\nlike prevented me from being wholly\npositive and supportive um at least\nemotionally\ninternally um but fortunately I think\nthat that Envy motivated me to examine\nmyself and say hey wait a minute I've\nknown these guys for years and years and\nyears they're no better than me it's\nlike the these guys aren't special I I\ngrew up with these guys if they can do\nit I can do it like there's absolutely\nno reason that I I can't have the same\ngood things that my friends have been\nable to secure for themselves and it was\nactually their\nmodling that encouraged me to kind of\ndream bigger for myself or to grow\nup I I wonder if there's a commonality\nin the two things that we're describing\nhere and that is that if you're a young\nguy caught in this this normal\ndepression that you go through in your\nearly 20s that you're probably not going\nto fix it in your basement you're going\nto have to go out and be amongst other\npeople and develop relationships and\nsomething about those relationships is\ngoing to pull you in a Direction that's\nthat's probably going to get you\nunstuck I think that's really wise\nbecause I think it reveals what I would\ncall the int psychic fallacy of\ndepression which is that depression is\njust something that exists between your\ntwo ears right it's it's like an\nattitude or a set of thoughts or\nfeelings that can be fixed simply within\nyourself which wouldn't require you to\nleave your basement right if it were\nentirely based inside of your own um\nmind now it's very much about your\nrelationship to the world yes your\nrelationship ship to the world and your\nplace within it and I think that that's\nwhere depression is most reliably and\neffectively addressed and I think that\nyou would agree yeah cool I think that's\na really important topic and I'm glad\nthat we discussed that anything more you\nwant to say on that\none nope okay this one I'm excited to\nask you the question is if you and Shawn\nhad young daughters well I don't have\nany children but I do know that sha has\na young daughter a teenage daughter so\nI'm gonna have him speak to this if Sean\nhad young daughter which he does at what\nage would you suggest they prioritize\nmarriage or to ask a more general\nquestion what kind of advice are you\nactually giving your teenage daughter\nabout man in\nrelationships when I first read this\nquestion said if you and shod had young\ndaughters and I thought you know I\nconsider Ryan a good friend but not my\ntype um so we're probably not going to\nhave kids but I hope that doesn't break\nyour heart um but\nno here's what I have told my daughter\nshe's she'll be graduating high school\none of these days she's a great kid and\nwe've talked\nabout tradeoffs in life\nand I think one of the\ncruestv LIE is that we're telling girls\nthat they can have it all that they can\ndo it all that there are no tradeoffs\nand I think what that translates into\nthe minds of a lot of women is you can\nparty in your 20s you can have\nadventures and you can build a career in\nyour 30s and then at some point you can\nstart to have family and this is such a\nnasty lie because I think this is new we\nwere talking earlier about things that\nmight not be new I think this is\nrelatively new that we're seeing a lot\nof women hit their late 30s and panic\nbecause now they're realizing that oh\nthey they'd like to have a family they'd\nlike to have kids around they'd like the\nthe the pitter of little feet and the\nfighting over toys and going to a high\nschool graduation someday and having\ngrandkids someday like this just hits\nlike a ton of bricks for some women not\nall women and so I've been watching this\nseemingly increase over the last few\ndecades and I've been very careful about\ntalking to my daughter and and telling\nher that look whatever you decide to do\nwith your life I'm going to back your\nplate because I know you're a good kid\nyou're going to make good decisions I'm\nin your corner 100% but there are\ntradeoffs and nobody's telling telling\nyou this no you know well we send our\nkid to a good school but if you go to a\npublic school you're not getting this\nmessage you're getting the message if\nyou're a girl you can have it all you\nget it from school you get it from\nmovies you get it from songs you get it\nfrom your classmat it's just this\nbarrage of information that there are no\ntrade-offs and I think men are better\nyoung men are better at understanding\nthat they're are trade-offs in life if\nonly because nobody has fed us this line\nof [ __ ] that we can have everything\num so what I've told my daughter is\nbe mindful of the decisions that you\nmake early in life because they're going\nto compound if you want to have a career\ncool you're going to have a career but\nthat's going to come at some kind of\nexpense down the road you can you're G\nto have to make tradeoffs in life and if\nyou for example want to become a\nsurgeon you're trading off the first 15\nyears of your adult life for this career\nand at some point you may realize that\nit's time to get started on a family but\nit might be too late by then so just be\nthoughtful this is interesting this is\ncoming right when I'm working on a\nchapter of the book that discusses\noptimal dating strategies for both men\nand\nwomen\nand I'm been struggling with the\neffectiveness of some of this advice\ncoming from me as a man like this all\nmakes sense to me I think it would be\nworthwhile for women to hear it do you\nthink that the fact that we're men would\ncompromise the ability of some of these\nyoung women to hear the\nmessage I don't know I mean facts are\nfacts and you can you can listen to or\nnot and not that I what I just said as\nfacts necessarily it's my impression\nthat there is an increasing number of\nwomen hitting their 30s and and getting\nhit with a ton of bricks that's my\nimpression maybe there's some data out\nthere you can ignore me or not well\neverything is a there are no Solutions\nthere only tradeoffs that sounds you\nsound like Thomas soul Who's Thomas Soul\nhe's the guy that says there are no\nSolutions there're only trade-offs he's\nhe's a brilliant Soul yeah's he's a\nbrilliant man he one of the best\nthinkers in in in the last hundred years\ncongratulations thanks for telling me I\nI was unintentionally going to\nplagiarize this guy so I guess I have to\ngo back and credit this no but you\ndidn't you didn't plagiarize you came up\nwith it on your own so you were at least\nas brilliant as he is ah yes liet and\nNewton inventing the calculus um so\nuh\nokay so women can do everything but they\ncan't have everything is that fair to\nsay I I wouldn't even say you can do\nanything my daughter's not going to be\nshe's not going to play on the NBA alth\nwell maybe these days she could she\ncould she could transition and throw a\nhisy and play for the NBA but there are\ncertain things you no not everything is\nWithin Reach and this is another thing\nthat I think men seem to understand a\nlittle bit better because we didn't grow\nup with a bunch of movies Disney movies\ntelling us that everything is within our\nreach because everything is not within\nour\nreach\nhow can a young woman\nrealistically and objectively assess\nwhat is within her\nreach that's a good question I think you\nthe same way well I think you go out and\nyou try things\nand you pick a path that that feels like\nit's consistent with your values and you\nyou start trying things that's what guys\nhave to do in this chapter that I'm\nwriting I talk about a little bit the\ninfluence of that let's say feminist\nideology on women's dating choices that\nthey can do everything and that there\nare no trade-offs but I also talk about\none of the reasons why a lot of modern\nwomen are behind the eightball with\nrespect to their meeting and dating\noptions these days is the relative\nabsence of fathers in their\num in let's say their their\ncourtship you nodded when I said that um\nwhat do you think about that absence of\nfathers yeah it's it's the plague on\nsociety and maybe it always has been you\nknow this is certainly not the first\ngeneration to have a a shortage of\nfathers but yeah it has such a\ntremendous effect on young women and\nyoung men maybe in in slightly different\nways\nI see it in a few different ways one is\nthat I think a few Generations ago every\nyoung man who was courting a young woman\nwould expect to have a conversation\nabout what are your intentions with my\ndaughter at some point right um and I I\nthink that a lot of women are only\nlearning the value of that gatekeeping a\nbit later in life when they're in their\n30s and on their apps and they say what\nare you looking for on this app and it's\nit's it's almost like once they realize\nthat their window is closing and they're\nrunning out of time to potentially\nsecure a partner for a family it's\nalmost like they get stricter with\nrespect to their filtering and their\ngatekeeping which may actually be\ncounter productive at that point but\nlike yeah some level women might need to\nact as their own fathers because For\nBetter or For\nWorse their fathers aren't really\ninvolved in their courtship decisions\nanymore yeah yeah and it might get to\njump back at your point you just made it\nmight be more difficult later in life\njust because the family-minded men have\nall been snapped up and they have\nfamilies and so if you're raising your\nstandards while the supply is going down\nyou're sort of spiraling into this you\nlonely\n[Music]\nAbyss but still suggesting that that\nwomen lower their standards uh to\nsecure a relationship is a pretty tough\nthat's a grim option\ntoo so I guess getting back to this\nquestion you know when do you start\ntalking to your your daughter about\nprioritizing marriage I think you have\nthe conversations early and you know I I\ndon't I don't tell my daughter how to\nhow to live her life I certainly guide\nher you know I'll show her how to rotate\nthe tires on the car and and we have\nlots of conversations about how\nrelationships are unfolding around us as\nfar as the decision she's going to make\nthat that's up to her and I'm smart\nenough to know at this age that I if I\ntell her to do something she's still\ngoing to do what she wants and she\nshould do what she wants but you can't\nhave those those conversations too early\nabout trade-offs and about how\nrelationships work and and even though\nyou can't wrap your head around it at\nyour age at someday at some point you're\ngoing to be 40 and it's going to come\nvery quickly and the decisions that you\nmake now are going to compound and and\nthey're going to affect you pretty\nprofoundly when you're\n40 okay well\nsaid let's talk about the next question\nwhy women terminate relationships more\noften I love this question um I you want\nto jump in on\nthat well we know for a fact that women\nterminate marriages more often than men\nthey terminate about 70 to 80% of them\nthese days\nI think that women terminate fewer\nnon-marriage\nrelationships but they still terminate\nmore of them relative to men I think it\nreally comes down to two things is that\nmost women have more optionality than\nmost men do and so when a woman is\ndissatisfied with the relationship for\nwhatever reason I think that she has a\npotentially objectively correct\nassessment that it won't be as difficult\nfor her to find herself in another\nrelationship before too long um maybe\nshe even has male orbiters that she can\nwarm up most women have not just a plan\nb or a plan C but a\nDFG um or at the very least they can put\non some heels and a tight dress and go\nsit down by themselves at a at a bar on\na Saturday night and get some interest\nfrom the local male population so I\nthink it's it's generally easier for a\nwoman to replace a man because they have\nmore passive optionality than most men\ndo I would say for younger women yeah\nolder women gets more complicated I\nwould\nagree uh with respect to why women\ninitiate more divorces than men I think\nit's because they're often they often\nhave perverse incentives to do so given\nthe fact that they can still potentially\nsecure\nthe same\nlifestyle and a sizable income without\nhaving to deal with particular man's\ndemands\nor\nobligations okay that's those are my two\nsenses what do you think I'll I'll\ndisagree with part of that and agree\nwith part of it and then it'll be\ninteresting if people see people Slug It\nOut in the comments but um I agree with\nthe optionality for younger women and\nparticular\nI I don't know statistics on dating\nrelationships breaking up who ends what\nand when you kind of expect dating\nrelationships you expect most of them to\nnot work out you expect you would expect\n99 out of 100 maybe to not work out you\nwhen you're looking for that that one\nperson who's going to make a good\npartner not to say that there's a one\nbut you're looking for for the good\ncandidate you got to go through a lot of\npeople so kind of expect that and and\nyeah as far as what you said about women\nhaving more option ity particularly in\nthe teens and 20s maybe early 30s\nabsolutely it starts to change pretty\ndramatically after that it's a lot\nharder for women\num where where I would differ with you\nis in ending\nmarriages um we know that women file for\ndivorce more frequently than men and I\nagree with you that there are perverse\nincentives I think that if a guy a guy\nwants to avoid family court\nbecause he knows that he's if somebody's\ngoing to be treated poorly it's probably\ngoing to be him although I have seen\nwomen get the short shifted in I've seen\nwomen get mistreated in Family Court the\nreason being that family court is a [ __ ]\nshow it's unaccountable judges it's\ncapriciousness there's no juries there's\nno oversight it's just it's just a\nfreefor all it's a disaster but a man\ncan go in relatively confident that if\nsomebody's going to be mistreated it's\nprobably going to be hin in terms of\ncustody and that sort of thing there\nhave been great improvements recently\nlike in Florida with alimony laws but\nbut um a woman can go into family court\nwith some confidence that if somebody's\ngoing to be mistreated it's probably not\ngoing to be her so I agree with the\nperverse incentives as far as why women\nfile for divorce more\nfrequently it's not fun for women to get\ndivorced women don't get divorc for\nsport and I know that you're not saying\nthat some of the red pill guys out there\nseem to think that women divorc for\nsport they're all just sociopaths and\nthat they're like sharks going through\nthe water looking for the next meal and\nagain I know you're not saying that but\nwomen don't divorce for sport we know\nwhy why people get divorced and we have\nepidemiological data going back decades\nand it's pretty prosaic stuff it's\nconflict it's um cheating it's substance\nabuse it's physical abuse it's just you\nknow the inability to get along together\nthey they're very basic reasons for why\npeople get divorced so the fact that\nwomen file for divorce doesn't\nnecessarily mean that women are causing\nthe divorce and I think this is where\npeople like the red pill crowd really\nreally get tripped up they see that\nwomen are filing for divorce and I don't\nknow if it's 70% but it's more than men\nand they say oh well then women must be\ncausing the divorce and they must be\ncausing the divorce for my favorite\nreason which is hypergamy that's that's\nthe red pill\nguys but we also know that men are more\nprone to the types of behaviors that\ncause divorce like cheating and\nsubstance abuse that's just it's just\nkind of how it is so you can't draw a\nstraight line between women filing for\ndivorce and women causing divorce it may\nactually be men a lot of times who are\ncausing the divorce and the woman saying\nI've had enough I've I've I've tried and\nI've tried and I've tried and I'm\ndone okay I think that some of the\nepidemiological data will need on this\nsubject will need to be interpreted\ncautiously because before no contest\ndivorce if you wanted to leave it had to\nbe for a significant reason it had to be\nbecause of infidelity or physical abuse\nwhich certainly happened in the context\nof marriages in the past um but if\nthat's your way out then and you have to\nnominate something in order to dissolve\nthe\nrelationship then maybe there are more\nfalse positives there if there were no\nother way to dissolve a marriage for\ninstance I think that that's reasonable\nI don't know to what extent there would\nbe false pauses but I think that we\nwould expect that at least some of them\nwould be\num you know I've dealt with a lot of\nguys in my clinical practice moving\nthrough divorce Sean and I mean I only\nhear one side of the story so that's\nsomething to\nconsider um but I don't know of a single\nman I've worked with who have gone\nthrough divorce who's told me yeah I\nbeat my wife so I get it or yeah I\ncouldn't stop drinking and so I\nunderstand why she left what are the if\nyou had to draw some Trends what are the\ntrends that you hear from guys about the\nreasons for they for divorce um it's\nit's something along the lines of she's\nnot happy and she's she doesn't she\nhasn't felt happy for quite some time\nthat's actually another Factor that's\nthat's important to put out there is\nthat women are more prone to they're\nthey're higher in trait neuroticism than\nmen generally speaking and so they are\nmore prone to being unhappy so I'm sorry\ngo ahead no it's it's it's that so um\nit's not so much that there are there's\nabuse or infidelity or significant stral\nproblems to the relationship it's that\nthey're not in love we're kind of we're\nkind of bickering so conflict sure but\nit's this just vague sense of like is\nthis going to be the rest of my life and\nI think that's where those perverse\nincentives differentially affect men and\nwomen I would agree with that yeah and\nso that you know I I would agree with\nyou that the vast majority of women\ndon't divorce for sport I think that\nthere probably are some sociopathic\nwomen out there absolutely who\nI mean get married because as far as I\ncan tell that's the only way that you\ncan get divorced and divorce can be a a\nvery lucrative\nprofession um if you do it right as a\nwoman yeah but I think my sense here is\nthat if if both parties are kind of\nvaguely dissatisfied or unhappy with a\nrelationship but ending the relationship\nis more likely to be financially\nbeneficial to one party versus the other\nwe would expect that under just benal\nconditions of vague\ndissatisfaction the one who is likely to\nbenefit is going to be\nmore likely to initiate a termination of\nthe relationship all things being equal\nand I think that's what we see yeah I\nthink that's a factor and I think it\nalso comes down to whether we're talking\nabout you know that big chunk in the\nmiddle of the bell curve with just sort\nof boring run-of-the-mill div divorces\nversus the extremes where you do have\npeople who are acting very badly on both\nsides and some of those people are women\nand some of those women are just\nopportunistic sociopaths but they're\nthese stram they're not the they're not\nthe middle of the bell curve which is\nwhat I think a lot of guys um comfort\nthemselves by believing you\nknow that the extremes represent the\nmiddle\nso where does this create any kind of\nconfidence for men because\nyes men can control their behavior they\ncan say Okay I I I've never I'm not\ngoing to hit my wife I'm not going to\nabuse substances I'm not going to cheat\non her and yet that gives him no real\nprotection\nagainst divorce which is basically an\nyou know know marriage is now and at\nwill relationship and the man could\npotentially\nbe haved with respect to his wealth and\nstatus as a consequence of a woman's\nbeing vaguely dissatisfied could be yeah\nyeah so this the reason I wrote that's\nthe reason I wrote Gaye keeper it's also\nthe reason I wrote the Tactical guide to\nwomen but you know the the way to\navoid the way to minimize risk and I\nthink I'm I carefully point this out in\nthe Tactical guid you can't eliminate\nrisk you can only you can only minimize\nit you can manage it as best you can and\none of the ways to manage risk in\nrelationships is to really understand\nyour relationship patterns so that you\nknow what you're vulnerable to and you\nknow it takes a lot of work it's it's a\nlot easier to just memorize a list of\nred flags but the red flags list will\nonly get you so far and if you're\nwilling if you want to have that sort of\nrelationship which I don't care if a guy\nhas that kind of relationship or not but\nif you're going to you're well served by\nlearning how they\nwork does that mean that you might\nexcuse me encourage men to delay even\nconsidering entering into marriage until\na certain time of life maybe in their\n30s um I hear that advice and I don't I\nthink that's fitting for some for some\nguys I don't think it's necessarily good\nblanket advice and I think it depends a\nlot on community and culture for one\nthing if you come if you come from a\ncommunity where you're dating within\nthat Community say it's a religious\ncommunity and you're both on the same\npage you're both you both embrace the\nreligion in in this example you both\nknow where you're headed you you have a\npurpose and that you collectively you\ntwo are pursuing then I don't know that\nyou need to wait until you're in your\n30s I think what you wait for is making\nsure that you have a good long reliable\nBaseline on her behavior on what the how\nthe relationship functions and how well\nyou do in the relationship and that\ntakes a lot of time um couple of years\nyou know but the the guideline that I\ngive in the Tactical guide is if you\nreally want to get to know somebody you\nwait until at least a year after the\ninfatuation phase because during that\ninfatuation phase you're not seeing\nclearly and she's not seeing clearly\nnobody's seeing clearly you're both\ndrunk but if you give it you know a year\njust as a good round number after you're\nno longer\ninfatuated and you've got lots of life\nexperiences with this person then that's\nthat's starting to establish a\nbaseline fair enough let's move on to\nthis next question I like this one it\nsays why is it so hard for men to have a\nstrong moral code and enforce\nit what do you think about that that one\nI struggled with and I thought I'd ask\nyou well if you have thoughts on that\none I do I think that it's\nit is difficult for men to have strong\nmoral codes and to enforce them it makes\nme this question made me think of the\nclassic film 12 Angry Men did you see\nthat one Sean I did not so that is a\ncourtroom drama and it takes place in\nthe jury deliberation room that's the 12\nAngry Men and the protagonist is Henry\nFonda and they're all deliberating on a\nmurder\ntrial and\nin their initial vote Fonda is the only\nguy who believes that the accused is not\nguilty so the initial vote it's 11 to1\nand the story is\nbasically him you know holding firm on\nhis conviction and in the face of this\nstrong opposition from these other men\nand eventually moves them in the\ndirection\nofid and this is an old movie it's an\nold story story I think came out in the\nin the'\n40s and I think it's a testament to like\nholding firm to what you believe in even\nin the face of opposition and what I\nwant to point out is\nthat in this story which is held out as\nsort of an arch typle of individual\nself-confidence in the face of\nopposition Henry Fonda only had to face\noff with 11\nguys versus world that was an\naccomplishment that we made a movie\nabout it and a story about it we still\ntell that story today versus how hard is\nit to stand against millions of people\nwhich is more or less what a lot of\nfolks have to do given the internet and\nsocial media and things like that like\nthe the willingness to\npublicly say this is what I believe in\nthese are my convictions and to\nwithstand the opposition that may come\ndown upon you if if it's a tough cell if\nit's rare for one person to do that\nagainst 11 I mean how much rarer must it\nbe in today's day and age that's that's\nwhat that question made me think about\nwell sure and especially if if your\nlivelihood depends on it for example\nsure you know you say the wrong thing\nyou could lose your job yeah and so\nthere's all the external forces and then\nthere's the internal forces I I face\nthis minor um ethical quandry in my\npractice this week there was there was\nsomething that I really wanted to do was\nit was a positive experience I really\nwanted to do this but ethically I knew\nit was not something that I I should\nparticipate in and um you you know\nnothing um nefarious or anything just\njust sort of a joyous occasion that that\nI was invited to go to and um I I\nflashed back on an Ethics Professor I\ncan't remember the person's name but he\nstarted off one of the ethics classes I\ntook by saying there's probably never\ngoing you're probably never going to\nface an ethical dilemma you're just\ngoing to face of a situation with an\nanswer that you don't want to hear you\nknow what's right you just don't want to\ndo it and I had to remind myself of that\nthis week because it would have been so\neasy to slide on on this little ethical\num just just this little ethical thing\nprobably would have had no consequence I\ncould have very easily Justified it but\nwhen you start letting yourself slide on\nthe little questions then it gets easier\nand easier to start sliding on the big\nquestions one of the ways I\nconceptualize having values is that\nvalues have value and therefore they are\nexpensive and sometimes to uphold your\nvalues can be very costly it can cost\nyou a relationship it can cost you a\nfriendship it can cost you your\nlivelihood it could cost you your peace\nof mind or even your\nsecurity like your physical security um\nand the unwillingness or the inability\nto pay those costs suggests that that\nvalue is only held more or less in name\nonly I think a lot of people especially\nin today's day and age with our pension\nfor virtue\nsignaling people might think it's enough\nsimply to espouse the right beliefs to\nto say the right things and they might\nbe unprepared for paying those costs\nwhen the rubber hits the\nroad in terms of the blowback that\nthey're going to get or yeah the\nblowback from specific\npeople antagonism in their relationships\nmaybe friends turning their backs losing\njob\nopportunities like the stakes have never\nbeen higher and never\nbefore maybe not never before but like\nin today's day and age it's not\nenough to Simply like just do your job\nwell you know now that's the ability to\ndo your job is mixed mied up on mixed up\nwith you know do you have the right\nbeliefs like I might not be able to was\nit's not enough to just be a good actor\nor a good Baker or a good Carpenter it's\nlike we've dredged up some information\nabout your conduct and your personal\nlife and and now you've been cancelled\nor you've been barred from effective\naction in The\nMarketplace that's that's very difficult\nto stand up against I would think it is\nand it takes a special combination of\nfortitude and intellect and um Drive I\nthink to to overcome that and I think\nyou're a good example of somebody who\nhas stepped outside of that system\nbecause you have this channel where you\nsay things that people in our profession\nare not supposed to say\nand I won't say you become uncan but\nyou're not subject to HR you know you're\nnot subject to the Mob uh you know\nruining your life in the way that they\nmight ruin the life of somebody who has\na job where they could get in trouble\nwith\nHR let's hope not I'm not trying to\ncourt any kind of controversy here yeah\nand and we're all subject to the Mob I\nguess you know but but you have stepped\noutside of the system and I not\neverybody can do that not everybody's in\na position to do that\num I don't actually now that I say that\nI don't know how true that is what do\nyou think I think I think people can\nstep out but it's not like what I've\nbeen able to build for myself I could\nconstruct overnight like I've been an\nentrepreneur for 20 years yeah um and\none of the reasons why I went down that\nroad is because I have put myself in\nposition where other people were\nempowered to either give me things or\ntake them away at their own pleasure and\nI didn't like that yes um so I went\nthrough the trouble and the expense and\nthe toil of building something that I\nhad more direct control over and could\nprotect from the capriciousness of\nothers and other I I don't think I'm\nunique in doing that in any way but it\nit does take a\ncertain temperament to be able to do\nthat you have to be able to assume a\ngreat deal of risk um you have to be\nwilling to be completely\nself-accountable um and you also have to\nbe able to compete successfully in the\nmarket Marketplace I mean one of the\nbenefits of being an employee is you\ndon't really have to think about\nanything you just get hired you show up\nthere's a there's an office to go to\nthere's a desk there like someone\nactually furnished you with supplies you\ndidn't have to scr up a customer the\nbusiness already did that they just\nemail you to say hey take care of X Y\nand Z you work for a predetermined\namount of time and then you get to go\nhome and not ever think about your job\nagain I mean there is a lot of Pros to\nSimply being an employee everything just\nsort of gets taken care of for you um\nthat's certainly not true when you're an\nentrepreneur and you run your own\nbusinesses can everybody be an\nentrepreneur probably not probably not\nno I I don't know how well society would\nfunction if everybody was an\nentrepreneur um certainly society would\nlook very different but what I'm\nsuggesting is that most a lot of people\ndon't have the temperament or the skill\nset to be a successful entrepreneur\nright and that's that's fine we don't\nneed a world full of entrepreneurs so\ngetting back to the question are are you\nare you making the case I would make the\ncase are you making the case that being\nan entrepreneur puts you in a position\nwhere it's easier to live by your moral\ncode yeah I think so because I don't\nhave to compromise my values in order to\nensure the Goodwill\nof my\nemployer that's not entirely true that's\nwhy I kind of slowed down like when I\nfirst started out let's say as a\nclinician I had difficulty filling my\npractice and it was in those moments\nwhen my clients were more were basically\nmy employers and it became harder in in\nthe beginning\n[Music]\nto to implement the kind of boundaries\nwith respect to my practice that I\nwanted to\nimplement because I didn't have a full\npractice let alone a weit list so if one\nperson decided that you know this time\ndidn't work for him or this is the how\nhe would prefer therapy to go like I\nwould have felt that loss like I might\nhave needed that client more than that\nclient needed therapy and that's not a\ngood position for that client to be in\nlike that's actually kind of a dangerous\nposition for that client to be in yeah\nso one way to be kind of honest and\nvirtuous is to not need any particular\nopportunity in in its specifics so what\nwould you say to a young guy let's let's\nsay that the guy who wrote this is 23\nyears old and he's wrestling with um you\nknow how to create a moral code and\nenforce it and he's one of these 23 year\nolds we were talking about earlier where\nhe doesn't have his his act together\nyet well I I think from my own\nexperience it just means being willing\nto pay the price for what you believe in\nand sometime to play kind of the other\nside of the coin here doing so also lets\nyou learn\nto pick your battles I think when I was\nyounger I was even\nmore punctilious with respect to my\nvalue system what does that mean you\nknow exacting okay if not even\nself-righteous okay about certain things\nand that\noften made it difficult to be in\nrelationship with me both men and women\nI thought that it was my my you know\nhigh moral code and my standards for\nmyself and others other people just\nprobably found me to be difficult to\ndeal with\nand like there's a time to stand firm\nbut that might mean losing access to\ncertain types of relationships and\nopportunities and you then have to kind\nof weigh in your estimation like what is\nthis worth like could I is this really\nworth ending the relationship sometimes\nit is if if going back on that spe or\ncompromising that specific value on some\nlevel significantly compromises the\nrelationship you're going to lose the\nrelationship one way or the other but\nsome of those values were really just my\nown I don't know self-righteousness or\nintolerance to be honest and I could\ncertainly have learned to navigate those\nrelationships more\nflexibly um does that make sense yeah it\nmakes sense because I you know I had\nsome similar experiences and I think\nmaybe one of the takeaways here is that\nwhen you're a younger guy it sometimes\nis a little confusing that to to know\nwhere you're being moral versus just\nbeing pigheaded or self-righteous and\nmaybe that's where moral you know moral\nstructure comes in like religion maybe\nthat that helps with this sort of thing\nbut um you know I think if you're a\nyoung guy you give yourself a little\ngrace to learn and adjust and figure out\nthat okay that that wasn't my morality\noperating that was more my ego operating\nokay so I'm I'm going to adjust next\ntime and I've learned a little something\nabout my morals from this incident I\nlike that all right well we got time I\nthink for one more question what do I\nhave\nhere this one also you're in a better\nposition to answer than I is it really\npossible to retain or even increase High\nerotic sexual desire when one is married\nSL together for years and decades and if\nis how does one achieve that what do you\nthink Sean yeah it's possible absolutely\nit's possible I don't know if it's the\nnorm honestly um and I don't know if\nit's not the norm but it certainly is\npossible to keep the sex life going\nthroughout your marriage and it takes a\nlittle bit of effort but um you know\nthere's there's some data out there that\nsays married men have more sex than than\nsingle men more and better sex there's\nthere's data that says that there's\nprobably data that says the other way\ntoo but um it's certainly is possible\nand I think it\ntakes a certain amount of it takes a\ncertain amount of effort to stay\ninvolved and and to make that a priority\nI'm starting this is all starting to\nsound like you\nknow something that any um Instagram\npsychologist would say it it takes some\na little bit of effort to to keep it\ngoing and what does that effort look\nlike can you give any actionable advice\nplayfulness um yeah it's if I had to\nboil it down to word it would just be\nplayfulness keep flirting with your wife\nkeep flirting with your woman and um you\nknow game game doesn't go away game is\nforever and game should be fun game in\nmy estimation game shouldn't be\nmanipulative or or um yeah it shouldn't\nbe manipulative it should be a fun thing\num back when you when I was a kid Prince\nwas the musician Prince was really big\nand you could you could watch Prince's\nif you watched his his mov movie Purple\nRain or and I saw him in um in concert a\ncouple of times and Prince was really\ngood at just playing with an entire\nArena of people and flirting with an\nentire Arena of people and it was kind\nof it was kind of interesting to watch\nhow this this tiny little guy would hold\nan arena in in the palm of his hand by\num giving a little bit and then pulling\nit back and then joking and then and\nthen making fun of you and then just\ndoing all these little playful things\nthat that you might do in a relationship\nand then might have been part of why he\nwas so successful but if you let those\nthings die away and I I guess I would\nsay the other thing is probably taking\ncare of yourself you know my wife and I\nhad we made an agreement when we got\ntogether that we were going to take care\nof oursel and it wasn't an ultimatum it\nwasn't hey if you get fat I'm leaving it\nwas each of us volunteering that I know\nI'm going to get older but I'm gonna do\nmy best to to stay presentable and to\nstay as attractive as possible for you\nand if I don't\nI'm going to understand if you want to\nrenegotiate because part of this is\nabout\nsex I don't know if everybody's up for\nthat kind of\nagreement it might be in the best\ninterest of both of you though to kind\nof create some sort of accountability\nstructure like yeah it might mean that I\ncan't ever relax completely into a\nTotally Secure Arrangement but maybe\nthat lack of complete Security is not\njust good for\nyou because it motivates me to be more\npresentable and attractive to you but\nit's good for me because it motivates I\nalso acre benefits from that by being\nhealthier and by being more vital and\nenergetic I think that that makes a lot\nof sense I think any kind of agreement\nthat can't ever be Rec Ed is prone to\nmore abuses than one they\ncan um and I think that there are ways\nthat you can create those\naccountabilities into a committed\nrelationship and that too\nmuch like permanent security may not be\nin the interest of the relationship or\nthe individuals\ninvolved I'm with you I heard a rabbi\nsay one time that the Spectre the\npossibility that's different the\npossibility of divorce is actually a\nvery good and healthy thing for a\nmarriage and that where there is no\npossibility of divorce like we see in\ncertain cultures that's when marriages\nget really miserable that's when people\ncan be abusive with abandon no fear of\nconsequences men in particular you know\nmen in certain cultures if they know\nthat their wife can't leave they they\ntend to get kind of abusive and and you\njust turn nasty not all of them but when\nthere's a possibility of divorce on both\nsides then there's this this incentive\nto you know take care of yourself take\ncare of them treat them well and and be\na good partner and I think it affects\neffort and I think it affects effort\nbeneath the threshold of conscious\nawareness like there is no way that\nanybody is going to put in more effort\nat a job if he feels that he could never\nbe fired that at a job in which he has\nto be accountable for his employment\nlike the man might be the most\ndisciplined virtuous person in the world\nbut that structure will insidiously\naffect his effort in ways that he's\nprobably not even consciously aware of I\nagree yeah you might see that for\nexample in places like the federal\ngovernment where jobs are pretty cushy\nand\nsecure folks tend to take it easy you\nmight see that if one were inclined to\nlook in that direction yeah\nwell Sean I think that is good for now\nthat was about 90 minutes I enjoyed the\nconversation um I'll plug your book it's\ncalled gatekeeper the Tactical guide to\nCommitment it's shant T Smith's sixth\nforay into the literary sphere I've read\nit I really like it I think it's\na I think it's\na\na successor to the Tactical guide to\nwomen in many ways and that book is just\nphenomenal as well so I'll put a link to\nthe book in the description to this\nvideo um and hopefully if this has pequ\nyour interest you can go check out the\nbook for yourselves any final words Sean\nwell this is fun I really enjoy the Q&A\nbecause it's like taking your brain to\nthe gym to to try to think on your feet\nso this was a good time I really\nappreciate you having me on again oh\nyeah and once again congratulations on\nall the progress with the channel thanks\nSean thank you for being here always\ngood to catch you we'll talk again soon\nokay yep bye\nbye"
