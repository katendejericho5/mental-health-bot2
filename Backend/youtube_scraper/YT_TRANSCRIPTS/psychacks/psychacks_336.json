    "transcript": "the third reason why it's easier for\nwomen to get into a new relationship\nthan it is for men is that men's\nstandards for entering into a\nrelationship are across the board\nsignificantly lower than women's\nstandards for the same most men I hate\nto say it but it's true most men will\nhave whoever will have them and if she's\ncute and willing to have sex with him\nand doesn't cause too many problems men\nare generally willing to entertain the\npossibility of a relationship on the\nother hand women have and are encouraged\nto have much higher standards for their\npotential mates and dates so even if a\nman wanted to get into a new\nrelationship right away he would run up\nagainst the unforgiving gatekeeping of\nwomen's standards"
