    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is higher\nslow and Fire fast so this is a rule of\nthumb in corporate Human Resources if\nyou are vetting applicants for an\nimportant well-paid job at your company\nthen you are likely going to be hiring\nslow and firing fast in this context\nhiring slow means that it's probably\ngoing to take several months to move\nthrough this process appli will likely\nundergo several interviews over that\ntime some will be structured some will\nbe unstructured some might be formal\ntests of ability some might be informal\nassessments of character and these\napplicants will likely be vetted by many\ndifferent stakeholders and if any one of\nthose stakeholders identifies something\nthat doesn't sit right then the whole\nprocess stops on a heartbeat that's\nfiring fast and this is wise because\nmost applicants will not be the one the\ncompanies higher so defaulting to\nrejection is the safer bet statistically\nand the company may have a lot to lose\nby taking on someone who is neither\ncompetent nor virtuous so it's\nappropriately\nself-protective in general if it works\nin business it works with women and this\nis no different when it comes to vetting\na woman for a relationship it is\nimperative that you hire slow and Fire\nfast allowing yourself to become\nemotionally involved with a woman before\nyou've appropriately vetted her for that\nrelationship is a risky proposition that\nis unlikely to produce the desired\noutcome why because most women will not\nbe a good fit for you so defaulting to\nrejection is the safer bet statistically\nand you absolutely have a lot to lose by\nentering into a relationship with\nsomeone who is neither competent nor\nvirtuous so it's appropriately\nself-protective if you don't hire or\nslow then you will likely be misled by\nyour emotional needs and or your sexual\nattraction to foreclose prematurely in\nwhich case you will likely only have\nbrought on someone competent and\nvirtuous through sheer dumb luck\nrelationships are always a role of the\ndie gentlemen but we can do things to\neven the odds as I've previously\ndiscussed it's your job men to resist\nthe urge to emotionally invest in a\ngiven woman prematurely and to that end\nyou're going to want to slow down the\nhiring process as much as possible there\nare several really good reasons for this\namong them is the reality that when it\ncomes to women you can always escalate\nbut you can never\ndeescalate what does that mean well\nlet's take something simple like\nfrequency of contact when I first get\ninvolved with a woman all I'll let about\na week go by from the previous\ninteraction before I contact her again\nthis creates a long Runway to move\ntoward regular daily communication too\nmany guys make the mistake of falling\ninto daily communication with a woman\ntoo soon and this is a mistake because\nyou leave yourself No Escape Route if\nyou train a woman to expect constant\ncommunication from the very start then\neven responding a few minutes later than\nyou otherwise would is going to create\nproblems what's going on is everything\nokay why are you ignoring me and you\ncreated this problem by training her to\nexpect a certain Cadence of attention\nand\ninteraction However the fact of the\nmatter is that this frequency of contact\nis only warranted with someone you trust\nsomeone who makes your life better and\nsomeone who you've already integrated\ninto your LIF style and someone you've\njust met almost by definition is not\nthis someone if things are going well\nyou can always decrease the space\nbetween subsequent contacts you can\nalways escalate but you can never\nincrease this space you can never\ndeescalate at least not without creating\nunnecessary difficulties in your life\nremember the easiest way to make a baby\ncry is to give it a lollipop and then\ntake it away if you never give it a\nlollipop to begin with you won't have a\nproblem on your hands and if you do\ndecide to give it a lollipop only do so\nif you're pretty sure you're not going\nto want to or have to take it away\nlater now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nepisode it's your contributions that\nhelp make all of this happen I really\nappreciate them thank you very\nmuch it's actually fairly normal not to\ngive too much attention to someone you\njust met like don't you have other\nthings to do do you really have so\nlittle going on in your life that you\ncan afford to chat for hours with\nsomeone who just a short time ago was a\ncomplete stranger to you my brothers\neven if you don't have something better\nto do which is a problem that you should\naddress sooner as opposed to later you\nhave to act like you have something\nbetter to do because if you don't you're\nnot going to leave any space for that\nsomething better to eventually come into\nyour life it's just going to be filled\nwith the first woman who showed some\ndegree of interest in you and the jury\nis still out on her so this isn't really\nplaying a game as much as it is acting\nlike a mature adult who has interests\nresponsibilities and an emotionally\ncompelling lifestyle so that's an\nexample of higher slow in the context of\ndating on the other hand Fire fast means\nthat as soon as it becomes clear that a\nwoman shows a red flag whether it's a\nconcerning Behavior or a toxic\npersonality trait you stop investing in\nher\nemotionally that means that you either\ndisengage from her entirely or you Silo\nher into a casual sexual relationship\nand you keep a tight rate on your\nemotions men it is your fault if you\nallow yourself to become emotionally\ninvolved with untrustworthy women or\nemotionally disregulated women or\naggressive disrespectful women like I\nunderstand that there are some good\nliars out there and many of those good\nliars are women but not all liers are\ngood in fact most of them aren't these\nwomen tell on themselves all the time\nask any man who has been through the\nringer of a dysfunctional relationship\nand if he's honest with himself self he\ncan generally look back and identify\nsigns of that dysfunction very early on\nin the courtship process he saw the red\nflags and he ignored them or\nrationalized them away typically because\nhe had already decided to emotionally\ninvest in this particular woman and\ntypically because she was either really\nhot Andor she was him really\ngood their sexual attraction or their\nlack of optionality functionally Trapped\nthem in a situation\nthat they understood was not in their\nbest interests but that they hoped might\nbe\nnevertheless and what facilitates the\nability to fire fast a very large\napplicant pool some companies are\nconstantly interviewing applicants even\nif they're not actively hiring do you\nunderstand if you wait to interview\nuntil you have an opening you're\nbasically planning to have a disruption\nin your operations and this is something\nthat successful companies can easily\navoid with a little forethought a large\napplicant pool allows companies to hire\nthe right person for the job instead of\nthe first person to show\ninterest optionality makes it easier for\npeople to act with dignity in their\nrelationships because it functionally\nenables them to not have to choose\nbetween being alone and being\nrespected women kind of have this\noptional\npassively like by default since the\nmajority of men will have sex with the\nmajority of women a woman could go out\ntonight and get something going if she\nwanted to it might not lead to a\ncommitted relationship but at least she\nwill be desired she will be accompanied\nand she will have her foot in the door\nthe same is not true for men men have to\ncreate their optionality it takes time\nand effort to do so but trust me it is\nworth it when a woman shows her true\ncolors it's optionality that will help\nyou to tell her to go pound sand\nallowing you to fire fast and it's\noptionality that will make you more\npatient and less hungry about moving\nthings along allowing you to hire slow\nits usefulness cannot be overstated what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a
