    "video_title": "Why WOMEN tend to serve MEN historically",
    "transcript": "in every culture that has ever existed\non this planet it is the servant that\ntakes the money it is the servant who\ngets paid so if in the vast majority of\nrelationships the net flow of resources\nmoves from the man to the woman then in\nthe vast majority of relationships we\nshould expect the woman to serve the man\nand this of course has been the case\nhistorically and my point here is that\nwomen's historical service to men has\nmore to do with this basic economic\nprinciple which is a consequence of\nhypergamy than with let's say\npatriarchal oppression and this is where\nwomen tend to get really quiet they like\nthe idea of gain but if they're getting\npaid then they're not the employer are\nthey so you have a choice ladies you can\neither be the boss or you can get a\npaycheck but you can't have it both ways"
