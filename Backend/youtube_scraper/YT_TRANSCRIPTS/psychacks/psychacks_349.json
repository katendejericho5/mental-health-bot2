    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nservant takes the money in this episode\nI'm going to be talking about one of the\nmost underappreciated consequences of\nfemale hypergamy as you know female\nhypergamy is the tendency in women to\nmate and date up status hierarchies\nbasically women look for men who are\nbigger taller stronger older higher\nstatus more successful higher earning\nEtc essentially they are looking for men\nwho can improve their quality of life\nwhich functionally allows women to mate\nand date for gain since women treat men\nthe way men treat jobs they will select\nthe man who represents the best overall\noffer however they choose to understand\nthat from among all the opportunities\nopen to them on the other hand men more\nor less have to resign themselves to\nmate and date for acceptable loss if you\nare a man who wants a woman in your life\nyou will have to pay in some way and\nit's not always with money in fact\ntransacting purely with money is one of\nthe cheapest ways of securing access to\nwomen men have to pay to play and the\nvalue they give up is generally greater\nthan the value they receive in return\nand it kind of has to be that way\notherwise women couldn't mate or date\nfor gain that's just simple economics\nnow it's for each man to decide for\nhimself what constitutes acceptable\nversus unacceptable loss with respects\nto his intentions and overarching\npurpose in life some women and\nrelationships will be within that band\nof acceptable loss and many will not but\nthat's just the way it is now women\ngenerally don't get upset when I talk\nabout their dating behavior in this way\nthey think I'm young I'm beautiful and I\nwon't have this chance forever so why\nshouldn't I try to get as much as I can\nfor as long as I can and it's hard to\ndisagree with them on some level they\nare behaving rationally within the\nsystem of incentives that constitutes\nthe game of dating as it exists in the\nsexual Marketplace today if I were a\nwoman I might do the exact same thing so\nI'm not judging them for this it's like\ngo get that bread but there is a flip\nside to this situation that a lot of\nwomen fail to appreciate I alluded to it\nin the title of this episode in every\nculture that has ever existed on this\nplanet it is the servant that takes the\nmoney it is the servant who gets paid so\nif in the vast majority of relationships\nthe net flow of resources moves from the\nman to the woman then in the vast\nmajority of relationships we should\nexpect the woman to serve the man and\nthis of course has been the case\nhistorically and my point here is that\nwomen's his historical service to men\nhas more to do with this basic economic\nprinciple which is a consequence of\nhypergamy than with let's say\npatriarchal oppression and this is where\nwomen tend to get really quiet they like\nthe idea of\ngain but if they're getting paid then\nthey're not the employer are they so you\nhave a choice ladies you can either be\nthe boss or you can get a paycheck but\nyou can't have it both ways\nrelationships are the medium in which\nvalue is transacted and in the sexual\nMarketplace men attempt to use resources\nto secure sexual opportunity and women\nattempt to use sexual opportunity to\nsecure resources however this is usually\nnot an equal transaction due to\nhypergamy women tend to benefit more\nfrom this exchange than men do this\ncreates a kind of\nindebtedness that has historically been\npaid off in various ways it is this\nservice that that women have rendered to\nmen that balanced the scales of the\ntransaction between men and women it's\nwhat made hypergamous relationships a\nfair trade modern women however tend to\nbulk at this service and yet they still\nmaintain their hypergamy they continue\nto mate and date for gain this means\nthat the netf flow of resources\ncontinues to pass from the man to the\nwoman which functionally means that the\nman is just paying to access the sexual\nopportunity this basically means that a\nlot of modern relationships are really\njust forms of prostitution with extra\nsteps this might ruffle some feathers\nhowever I honestly don't know what else\nto call an arrangement in which\nresources are exchanged for sexual\nopportunity now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from its\nmessage because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nmessage I don't do corporate\nsponsorships or product placements so I\nrely on your support to keep all of this\ngoing I really appreciate it thank you\nvery\nmuch again the way out of this situation\nhas historically been for the woman to\nprovide other forms of service to the\nman that were of use and interest to him\nthis created a fair trade in a pergamus\nrelationship in which unequal Goods of\ncomparable value were transacted the\nissue is that no one really likes to be\nthe\nservant even if that is what creates the\nbasis of a fair transaction early\nfeminists understood that it was the net\nflow of resources from the man to the\nwoman that kept women in the service\ncapacity this is why say Virginia wolf\nspoke on the importance of money and A\nRoom of One's Own without B she argued a\nwoman could not be self-determined and\nyou know what she's right if you want to\ncall the tune you have to pay the piper\nand that's why so much of second W\nfeminism focused on improving women's\nmaterial conditions without their own\nmoney women would likely forever remain\nin the servant role and for the record I\ndon't have any problem with this I can\nsympathize I wouldn't want to be the\nservant\nindefinitely but I also pay my\ndebts and service is the pathway out of\nindebtedness for a man or a woman now\nfast forward a 100 years from Miss wolf\nwomen have their own money and they have\ntheir own room actually in most cases\nthey have the whole house however they\nstill date\nhypergamous they still mate and date up\nstatus hierarchies though it's becoming\nharder and harder for them to do so and\nthis means the net flow of resources\nstill moves from the man to the woman\nthe issue of course is that women bulk\nat the service that they have\nhistorically performed in order to\nabsolve this relative debt they want to\nbe the boss and they want to collect a\npaycheck which doesn't work this is the\neconomic explanation for why men are\ndissatisfied with modern relationships\nwhy they say that relationships with\nwomen are too expensive and why the\njuice isn't worth the squeeze because of\nwomen's hypergamous Tendencies and their\nunwillingness to serve relationships are\na net benefit to women the only way\nwomen can escape the servant role in an\neconomically Justified way is to enter\ninto relationships with men of\ncomparable status and lifestyle and this\nis difficult for two main reasons in the\nfirst place this is difficult because\nhypergamy runs deep\nit is hard to give up the desire to get\npaid and this is because there is likely\na biological component to hypergamy that\ncannot simply be overridden with\ncultural programming ultimately women\nare going to want what they want not\nwhat a given ideology tells them they\nshould want in a certain historical\nmoment however it's really one or the\nother give up the paycheck or provide a\nservice desired by the other party of\ncomparable value and in the second place\nit is difficult for women to enter into\nrelationships with men of comparable\nstatus because the passage of time tends\nto affect men and women's status\ndifferently For Better or Worse men's\nstatus tends to increase and women's\nstatus tends to decrease as a function\nof time this means that an equal trade\nat say 30 will likely not remain an\nequal trade at 50 What Might Have Been a\nfair exchange to begin with becomes\nincreasingly unfair as the years pass\nwhich if uncorrected is subject to\ncreating all kinds of difficulty in the\nrelationship what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel member with
