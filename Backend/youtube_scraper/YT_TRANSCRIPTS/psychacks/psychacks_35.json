    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is you get\nwhat you pay\nfor this is the third part of my\nthree-part series on why successful men\nuse escorts so be sure to check out the\nfirst two episodes before proceeding all\nright if you're still with me after all\nthis time thank you thank you for\nkeeping your reactive Judgment at Bay\nlong enough to entertain a different\nperspective at this point however let's\nshift away from explaining why\nsuccessful men might use escorts to\nresponding to the most common objections\nto this explanation Far and Away the\nmost common push back I received to this\nargument is something along the lines of\nyeah but Orion how gross and\ntransactional is that relationship an\nescort isn't going to love you she may\nnot even like you in fact it's entirely\npossible that may even loath and despise\nyou and that she only masks her true\nfeelings for you because she's being\npaid in light of this how can you\npossibly Advocate men pursue this\noption so how would I respond to this\nrebuttal well first and foremost by\nreminding the objector that I'm not\nadvocating this option I'm explaining it\nwhich is value neutral remember I've\nnever done this myself I'm just\nexplaining why successful men hire\nescorts when they choose to do so\nnext I would agree with the Crux of this\nobjection absolutely there is certainly\nno guarantee that an escort will love or\neven like her client but here's the rub\nthere's no guarantee of that in a\nrelationship\neither I know countless men who are\nmarried to women who dislike them if not\noutright hate them a non-transactional\nrelationship whatever that is does not\nguarantee let's say authentic positive\nregard men who date traditionally can\nand do end up in Loveless sexless\nmarriages and this contrary to popular\nbelief isn't always due to the fact that\nthese men are screwing up in some\ncapacity like by doing too many of the\nwrong things or too few of the right\nthings for example among other things\nit's much more likely for a woman to\ndisrespect a safe good man than a\ndangerous bad boy mostly because the\ngood man would never even think to\nimplement aversive contingencies against\nher\nbehavior but there's another more\nimportant reason why this objection is\ninadequate namely a transactional\nrelationship in no way invalidates the\npossibility of authentic positive regard\nobviously this doesn't always happen but\nit certainly doesn't never happen in\nfact some of the most satisfying\nrelationships in people's lives are\nrelationships with those they pay the\nhead of their Jiu-Jitsu Dojo their\nstylist or Barber their local Bartender\nthe owner of their favorite hle in the\nWall Restaurant their\ntherapist just because money changes\nhands doesn't mean that the emotional\ndimension of the relationship is\ninvalidated or rendered moot like as a\ntherapist I can tell you that I\nauthentically care about my clients and\nthat caring is a big part of what heals\nit also factored into my decision to\nenter into this profession as opposed to\nsome other line of work so there's\nprofessional goodness of\nfit that said I'm not a charity I do\nthis for a living and because I provide\na service of value to others it's\nreasonable that I should be compensated\nfor that service otherwise my ability to\nprovide that service indefinitely would\nbe compromised even nonprofits need\nfundraisers if people didn't pay we\nwouldn't continue to work together\nhowever the fact that there is a\nfinancial transaction at the heart of\nour relationship does not nullify the\nauthenticity of the feelings we share in\nthe connection we form obviously therapy\njust wouldn't work otherwise it's the\nconnection that heals in fact in one\nstudy I read on therapeutic outcomes the\nsingle greatest factor associated with\npatient Improvement was their perception\nthat their therapist liked them so on\nsome level it's my job to like my\npatients and let me tell you if I\nsecretly hated my patients I probably\nwould have needed to find another line\nof work a long time ago so I don't buy\nthe idea that people can't have\nauthentic caring relationships with\nprofessionals and I don't buy the idea\nthat you effortlessly or inevitably\nreceive authentic care in\nnonprofessional relationships\nprofessional relationships can be good\nand professional relationships can be\nbad non-professional relationships can\nbe good and non professional\nrelationships can be bad but it's\nactually less likely for professional\nrelationships to be bad for the simple\nreason that if they were consistently\nbad they would likely have gone out of\nbusiness by now here's another way to\nlook at it let's say that you and I go\nout to eat for dinner and when we open\nthe door and walk in the hostess gives\nus this big smile the moment she sees us\nand says hey welcome in we're so happy\nto have you and you respond oh please\nyou know we both know you're not\nactually happy to see us you're just a\npaid professional doing your job so you\ncan cut the\n well first of all guess who's\nnever going to be taken out to a\nrestaurant again it's like no the\nhostess is only there because she's\ngetting paid but maybe she went into the\nhospitality industry instead of\nMetallurgy or venture capital or\nEndocrinology because it's a good fit\nfor her personality she might actually\nenjoy being warm and nice so she found a\njob where she could get paid for doing\njust that and second it's nice to be\ngreeted with a smile when you walk\nthrough a door like that's part of the\nexperience you pay for when you go out\nto eat at a restaurant contrast that\nwith how most men are received when they\nwalk through other doors maybe even the\ndoors of their own homes are they\ngreeted with attention and warmth and\nconsideration and service\nin general not getting what they want\ndoes not cause people's desires to\ndisappear it just motivates them to seek\nout the satisfaction of those Desires in\nother\nways now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help

to\neverything I just discussed are in the\ndescription below please check them out\nit's how you can support me in my\nmission on this channel all right let's\nget back to\nit so while it's certainly possible for\nexplicitly transactional relationships\nto be soulless and deceptive this is far\nfrom the inherent nature of such\nrelationships just like people can and\ndo feel authentic care and interest for\nthose with whom they broker explicitly\ntransactional relationships they can and\ndo feel indifference and disinterest for\nthose with whom they have romantic\nrelationships and while it may be true\nthat you can't enter into the highest\nrelationship Potentials in explicitly\ntransacted\nrelationships in such relationships the\nrelationship downsides are mitigated\nconsiderably what does that mean well\nlet's say a man hires an ex an escort\nand has a bad experience with her he\nnever has to call that woman again he's\nout an hour and a th bucks contrast that\nwith the risks and expenses associated\nwith a Loveless sexless marriage getting\nout of that situation could cost that\nman millions of dollars and years of\nemotional hardship it's far far more\nexpensive I recently did a consultation\nwith a man who told me that he added up\nthe divorce settlement and 10 years of\nalimony and divided that total which did\nnot include the maintenance costs\nthroughout the relationship by the\napproximate number of sexual encounters\nhe enjoyed with his wife over the course\nof their marriage when he did this he\nrealized that he functionally paid his\nex\n$50,000 per sexual encounter and I think\nwe can all agree that's a ludicrous\namount of money to pay for\nsex explicitly transactional\nrelationships may not be the highest to\nwhich people can attain but they are far\nfrom the lowest and the mitigation of\nrisk may be a much more important\nconsideration to highly successful men\nin these relationships a slightly lower\nceiling is more than offset by a much\nhigher\nflower and this is precisely because\nwhen we deal with professionals we\nreasonably expect some degree of\nprofessionalism on their part it doesn't\nmatter if they're having a bad day or\nthey're stressed out or they have other\nthings on their minds that's not ex an\nexcuse for rude disrespectful\nincompetent or negligent behavior in a\nprofessional environment and in general\nthe more we pay the higher the\nexpectations for the quality of service\nwe receive let me tell you the waiters\nat French Laundry treat their diners\nextremely well they are not rude or\ndisrespectful or aggressive and they\ncertainly treat their customers with\nmuch more attentiveness Grace and\ncompetence than do the waiters at a\nlocal Diner and if if you aren't treated\nas well when you pay less think about\nhow well you are treated when you appear\nto pay\nnothing just consider how many women\nbehave in their traditional romantic\nrelationships some of these women treat\na stranger in the supermarket with more\nrespect and consideration than their own\nhusbands and they often feel justified\nin doing so as I've said before one of\nthe most dangerous relationship beliefs\nis the belief that in your Rel\nrelationship you're finally free to be\nyourself warts and all in point of fact\na relationship like a job is a privilege\nand one you have to constantly earn a\nnew by providing sufficient value it is\na privilege to be a husband and a\nprivilege to be a wife it is a privilege\nto be a boyfriend and a privilege to be\na girlfriend relationships are roles and\nwe don't ever get to stop playing\nit's also important to remember that\npeople don't just go out to eat because\nthey don't know how to cook a lot of the\ntime people go out to eat because they\ndon't want to go shopping and then cook\nand then clean up afterwards they want\nto delegate those chores and secure a\ndesirable Solution on demand and you\nknow what it's nice to be taken care of\nlike it feels good which is why people\npay for experiences that make them feel\ngood every day\nwomen how often do you come over to your\nman's place on demand service him\nsexually and then\nleave probably not that often in fact\nmany of you might consider such an\ninteraction exploitative or beneath your\ndignity to perform it's like fair\nenough but that doesn't stop men from\nDesiring that experience like just\nbecause your man won't cook for you\ndoesn't mean you stop wanting to be\ncooked for you just go outside the\nrelationship to satisfy that desire and\nyou pay for the privilege of doing so so\nlet's recap across these past few\nepisodes I've attempted to explain why\nsuccessful men that is men who shouldn't\nhave difficulty accessing traditional\ndating opportunities with enthusiastic\nwomen use escorts they do so because\ntraditional dating has become far too\nexpensive for them by virtue of their\nsuccess and optionality from the\nperspective of these men three dates\ncould cost\n$115,000 or more with absolutely no\nguarantee of mutual interest or a sexual\nencounter the time and energy that men\nspend in attracting and maintaining\nwomen could be expended in more\nprofitable ways when men isue\ntraditional dating including devoting\nmore time and energy to any not\nexplicitly transactional relationships\nin their lives that may be more pleasant\nand rewarding men who use escorts often\nsecure sexual encounters with more\nattract attractive women more cheaply or\nat least they can pursue sexual\nexperiences with the women of their\nchoosing what's more they are generally\nassured of a professional relationship\nthat mitigates their risk and limits\ntheir downside finally they enjoy more\npower and control over nearly every\naspect of the relationship in short\nsuccessful men use escorts because it\nmakes more economic sense than\ntraditional dating and it solves a\nnumber of problems that become\nincreasingly Salient as a function of\ntheir\nsuccess now many women if they've gotten\nthis far are just going to respond well\nif these men like their prostitutes so\nmuch then they can just go off with them\nfor all I care and let me be I wouldn't\nwant one of those disgusting losers\nanyway and that of course is their right\nbut I'm here to tell you that not all\nmen who use prostitutes are disgusting\nlosers and they're probably not going to\nchange their behavior as a consequence\nof your judgment anyway\nthink of the foregoing as market\nresearch I'm here to tell you that many\nof your Target customers are buying a\ndifferent\nproduct why might that be get curious\ndenigrating your customers as stupid or\ntasteless isn't going to bring back your\nmarket share however if you can\nunderstand as non-defensively as\npossible why these customers might be\npassing up your opportunity in favor of\nanother you might be able to\nappropriately adapt your strategy to\nrecapture their attention in any case I\nhope I've provided you with some food\nfor thought what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening"
