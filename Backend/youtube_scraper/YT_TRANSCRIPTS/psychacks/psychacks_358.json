    "transcript": "I went to uh Tish School of the Arts and\nI went to the experimental Theater Wing\nthe entire first semester of my acting\ntraining was spent playing one game\nthat's it we played this one game for\nlike 4 months straight that's all we did\nand I've since realized that this game\nis the fundamental game of human\ninteraction it's very simple it's called\nthe game of please no there's always two\npeople who play I'll start I can only\nsay the word please you go second you\ncan either say yes or no and you have to\nstart with no and the goal of the game\nis for me to get your no into a yes\nusing only the word please so what this\nforces people to do is it very quickly\nthey come up against the limits of their\nown like semantic language if the only\nword you can say is please you have to\nrely on all other forms of communication\nlike gesture body posture eye contact\nexpression Rhythm duration like you\nlearn how to communicate\nnon-verbally and you learn to listen\nreally well to people because the way\nsomeone tells you no always offers a\nclue as to what it would take to get\nthem to say yes"
