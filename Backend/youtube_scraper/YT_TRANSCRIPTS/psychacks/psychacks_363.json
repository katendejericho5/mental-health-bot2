    "transcript": "in a committed relationship your partner\nis kind of your exclusive sex dealer\nlike the company store at which you have\nto do your shopping so it makes sense to\nprioritize sexual elements in the scheme\nof needs when entering into a romantic\nrelationship now the push back I\ngenerally get from this position is\nbasically well Orion this just sounds so\nmercen like all you care about is money\nall you care about is sex and that's not\nactually what I said these aren't the\nonly things to care about they're just\nthe most important things to care about\nin certain contexts I don't care what\nother reasons you have for going to work\nif you stopped getting a paycheck you\nwouldn't show up on Monday as passionate\nand fulfilled and aligned with the\nmission statement as you were you\nprobably wouldn't work by the same token\nif the sex in a relationship dries up\nit's highly likely that the guy\neventually won't be reporting for Duty\nespecially if he isn't married to you"
