    "transcript": "to receive respect you need to\ncommunicate to others that there is\nsomething in you to be feared this isn't\nsufficient to receive s respect but\nwithout meeting this condition respect\ngenerally doesn't occur and this might\nbe why King Solomon argued the highest\nwisdom was to keep God's Commandments\nand to live in the fear the fear of the\nLord when people do not fear the\nconsequences of their actions they\nbehave less wisely so even wisdom like\nrespect might require appropriate fear\neliminating it entirely may not be to\nour benefit"
