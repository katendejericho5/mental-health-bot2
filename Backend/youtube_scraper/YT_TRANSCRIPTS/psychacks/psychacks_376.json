    "transcript": "the point that people who struggle with\nthis issue of disrespect need to\nunderstand is this it's important for\npeople to hear you hiss if you present\nyourself as so Meek and agreeable that\nyou would never possibly bite anyone\nunder any circumstances you might end up\nas everyone's personal whipping board\nthey'll be angry with other people but\nthey'll take it out on you why because\nthey wouldn't be so sure that the people\nthat they're actually angry with\nwouldn't retaliate but they apparently\naren't any consequences to treating you\nwith anger and disrespect for whatever\nreason probably due to your own\njudgments about anger and aggression you\nhave decided that implementing\nconsequences is just not a possible\noutcome of this interaction"
