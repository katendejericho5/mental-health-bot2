    "transcript": "I spoke with a woman in her early 50s\nrecently who had two kids by two\nprevious marriages and who told me that\nshe wasn't willing to have sex before\nmarriage with any man she is currently\ndating you can't make this up as may be\nunsurprising she has been single for\nquite some time I spoke with another\nwoman recently she was 41 who was\nlooking to get married and start a\nfamily she told me that she blamed her\ninability to have secure this\nrelationship already on the fact that in\nthe past she jumped into bed with men\ntoo quickly I assured her this was not\nthe problem women should be very\nsexually generous with the men they're\nhoping to catch the problem was not what\nshe was doing the problem was who she\nwas doing it with as I've said before\nwomen do the right things with the wrong\nmen but rather than examine her tendency\nof targeting the wrong men she decided\nto shoot herself in the foot by making a\nrelationship with her even more\nexpensive than it otherwise would have\nbeen by making men wait longer for sex\nnow she wouldn't sleep with a man until\nat least the third date"
