    "transcript": "what many folks who have never been to\ncoup's therapy often fail to appreciate\nis that in most coup's therapy the\nclient is the relationship the client is\nnot the two individual people in the\nroom the client is the relationship\nbetween them as such the therapist is\ngoing to be advocating for the best\ninterests of the relationship so why is\nthis problematic well in the first place\nit means that one or both of the parties\nmight be supported to stay in a\nrelationship with someone they\nabsolutely have no business being in a\nrelationship to begin with a couple's\ntherapist is not going to turn to the\nman in the middle of a session and say\nmy dude you need to get as far away from\nthat woman as possible by the same token\nthe therapist is not going to turn to\nthe woman in the room and say this guy\nis never going to commit to you no\nmatter what sacrifices you make for the\nrelationship if you want a family you\nare wasting your time here"
