    "video_title": "How men should APPROACH DATING",
    "transcript": "the sheer active approaching does not\nmake people more attractive it makes\nthem less attractive so how can we\nresolve this now here's the answer the\nway out of this double bind is for men\nto think of themselves like job\nrecruiters consider what a job recruiter\ndoes a job recruiter has to call people\nwhen they're not expecting it they might\nbe interrupting someone they might be a\nnuisance many people they reach out to\nwill have no real interest in speaking\nwith them so they often have to deal\nwith indifference or antagonism for a\nwhile if and when someone actually stays\non the line to talk with them this is\nbecause they initiate the interaction\nwhich of course puts them at a\nsignificant disadvantage but here's the\nthing people can succeed as job\nrecruiters if in those first five\nminutes they can get you so interested\nin the job opportunity they represent\nthat you are then motivated to apply for\nthe position yourself and when they\nsucceed in doing so the whole script\ngets flipped"
