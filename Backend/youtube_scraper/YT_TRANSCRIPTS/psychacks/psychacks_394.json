    "transcript": "in your case you have your private\ntherapy practice that you do and you\nstill maintain I'm assuming right as\nwell um so what made you um segue into\nthe YouTube world how did you get\ninvolved with that sure so I had been\nworking as a psychologist and private\npractice for about six years and as I\nsaid I was specializing in men's mental\nhealth and I had a full practice and I\nfelt like I was doing a lot of good like\nI could see people were getting better\nas a consequence of their engagement\nwith me not always but almost always and\none of the things that it was very\nsatisfying to do that you know for sure\nbut with a private practice you work\nwith 30 maybe 40 people a year now if\nyou can really change even 30 or 40\npeople's lives for the better that's no\nsmall thing right but I figured that if\nwhat I was doing with these guys might\nbe helpful for them well they're not so\ndifferent from potentially millions of\nother men out there on the planet so\nmaybe I could find some sort of platform\nsome sort of conduit through which I can\nreach all these other men because if it\nworks for these guys it might work for\nall these other guys as well and so that\nwas really my motivation"
