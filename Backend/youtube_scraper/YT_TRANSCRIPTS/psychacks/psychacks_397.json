    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is men's\ndating double bind so men are at a\nsignificant disadvantage when it comes\nto the initial stages of the courtship\nprocess and this disadvantage is unique\nto them because of some of the social\nand cultural expectations that inform\nthat process let's jump right into it so\nwhat is men's dating double bind here it\nis on the one hand men are expected to\ninitiate and make the offer to women\nthey are expected to approach the woman\nat the bar not the other way around they\nare expected to ask her out on a date\nnot the other way around they are\nexpected to lead the interaction in the\ndirection of a sexual encounter not the\nother way around if men don't take\naction then in the vast majority of\ncases nothing happens that's just the\nway it is now this situation already\ncomes comes with a number of\ndisadvantages most notably men must bear\na disproportionate amount of rejection\nin any negotiation process it's always\nmore powerful to be in a position to\nrespond to say yes or no and this is the\nposition that women occupy in the sexual\nMarketplace by default just consider how\ndifferent it feels to send in a resume\nfor a job\ncold and to get a phone call from an\neager recruiter in which scenario are\nyou more likely to be offered a job in\nwhich scenario are you more likely to\ncommand a higher salary Etc in the game\nof please no it's never the player who\nacts first who gets to decide however\nthat's not the double bind the double\nbind is that as soon as a man approaches\na woman he is functionally putting\nhimself in the pursuer role in the\nadorer role and people will swear up and\ndown and left and right that this isn't\ntrue but the fact of the matter is that\nwe like people who like us less than we\notherwise would if we had no idea of\ntheir feelings I will say that again we\nlike people who like us less than we\notherwise would if we had no idea of\ntheir feelings it's that old Groucho\nMarx joke I would never want to belong\nto a club that would have me as a member\nwomen in particular swear this isn't\ntrue but if it were the case that liking\npeople caused them to like you more then\nsuccessfully seducing a woman would\nsimply be a question of pursuing her\nmore than anyone else and every man\nknows that this isn't the case and every\nman knows this because every man starts\nby doing this and it's typically only\nafter sufficient heartbreak and\nrejection that he begins to question\nthis fundamental assumption as I\nexplained in a previous episode people\nwant what they want not what wants them\nthe grouo corollary as I call it is that\npeople want what wants them even less\nthan they otherwise would if they were\nunaware of that wanting and that's the\ndouble bind in the sexual Marketplace if\nthe man doesn't initiate nothing happens\nhowever if he does initiate he\nautomatically becomes less attractive\nthan he otherwise would have been just\nby keeping his mouth shut and doing\nnothing but if he does nothing then\nnothing happens du pursuing a woman puts\nher in the role of the adored which as I\nexplained in it's better for women to be\nadorers is not where women actually want\nto be and one of the reasons why this is\nthe case is because it's much harder for\na woman to look up to respect and be\nattracted to a man when he's in the\nadorer role if he's looking up at her\nshe is looking down at him\nthe very Act of approaching or declaring\nhis feelings can instantly knock a point\nor two off a man's perceived sexual\nMarketplace value so this is the double\nbind the man is kind of damned if he\ndoes and damned if he doesn't and this\nwill only affect men as long as men are\nthe only ones expected to\ninitiate if it were the case that\napproaching made men more attractive\nthen it would be a fairly simple thing\nto solve the dating crisis you would\njust get more more men to approach more\nwomen the act of approaching would make\nthem more attractive than the otherwise\nwould and this increased attractiveness\nwould facilitate sex and relationships\nbut that's obviously not how it works\nnow you need some at bats in order to\nget some hits but the sheer AC of\napproaching does not make people more\nattractive it makes them less attractive\nso how can we resolve this now before I\ngive the answer to that question if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nepisode I don't do corporate\nsponsorships or product placements so I\ndepend on your support to make all this\nhappen the more support I get the more I\ncan devote to the channel so thank you\nvery much I really appreciate\nit now here's the answer the way out of\nthis double bind is for men to think of\nthemselves like job recruiters consider\nwhat a job recruiter does a job\nrecruiter has to call people when\nthey're not expecting it they might be\ninterrupting someone they might be a\nnuisance many people they reach out to\nwill have no real interest in speaking\nwith them so they often have to deal\nwith indifference or antagonism for a\nwhile if and when someone actually stays\non the line to talk with them this is\nbecause they initiate the interaction\nwhich of course puts them at a\nsignificant\ndisadvantage but here's the thing people\ncan succeed as job recruiters if in\nthose first five minutes they can get\nyou so interested in the job opportunity\nthey represent that you are then\nmotivated to apply for the position\nyourself if they're good that's what\nrecruiters do they drum up an interest\nand a motivation that was potentially\nnon-existent just a few moments ago and\nwhen they succeed in doing so the whole\nscript gets flipped\nwhen recruiters cold call someone they\nare 100% in the pursuer role however by\nthe end of the conversation the other\nperson is filling out an application to\ntheir company the other person is now\npursuing and the other person\nunwillingly takes on the disadvantages\nof that position so this is the way out\nfor men men you can't avoid the cold\ncall you can't avoid approaching but but\nyour goal in approaching is to get some\nsort of purchase in the conversation so\nthat you can flip the script as quickly\nas possible the longer you spend in the\npursuer role the less likely you're ever\ngoing to catch that woman and the reason\nfor that is that women generally only\nallow themselves to be caught by the men\nthey want to be caught by pursue a woman\nand you're much more likely to pursue\nher right out of your life than to\noutrun her and how do recruiters get\npurchase in the conversation by\nstimulating interest for example in\ngeneral people want more money so if a\nrecruiter can flash a significantly\nhigher salary then he's going to capture\na lot of people's attention but does the\nrecruiter actually give people the money\nno he just shows it to him same thing\nmen succeed with women not by giving\nwomen what they want but by showing them\nwhat they want this will excite the\nwoman's interest all by itself and\nmotivate them to pursue you in many\ncases demonstrating that you're a high\nvalue man can stimulate a woman's\ninterest however it only ever does so\nindirectly and it runs the risk of\nattracting the wrong kind of woman\nanyway it's a better move to stimulate a\nwoman's interest directly by engaging\nher emotionally and this is something\nyou can get better at with practice the\nidea here is to stimulate a woman's\ninterest by engaging her emotionally and\nthen slowly backing\noff this is how you get a woman to\nfollow you not through money not through\ncommitment but through her emotions\nremember women are loyal to their\nemotions if you can engage them\nemotionally then you can leave behind\nthe door rooll and break out of the\ndouble bind and I'll talk more about how\nto do this in future episodes what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in those comments\nbelow and
