    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how men\nget suckered into fighting with women\nlike many things I discuss on this\nchannel this is something that I've\nlearned the hard way however once I\nfigured this out I was able to turn this\nfranchise around in a really big way and\ntoday I'm going to share the secret with\nyou first and foremost it's important to\nappreciate that big things can have\nSmall Beginnings an entire Forest can be\nburned down from the flame from a single\nspark in the context of the present\ndiscussion this means that many\narguments with women begin with a very\nsmall Catalyst and this is exactly where\nmen need to be most cautious as they are\noften subject to thinking that these\nsmall catalysts shouldn't really matter\nor are no big deal and that isn't NE\nnecessarily\ntrue that said these small catalysts are\nvulnerable precisely because they're\nsmall it's always easier to pull a weed\nthat has just sprouted than to wait\nuntil it sunk its roots deep into the\nground so this danger is also our\nopportunity the opportunity to nip a\npotential problem in the bud before it\nbecomes a problem as\nsuch now most men do not want to fight\nwith their women\nhowever they are often suckered into\nfighting with them because they fall for\na very subtle trap a trap that women\nwhen they are emotionally\n[Music]\nthey will make bigger and give back to\nyou if you give a woman a little\nirritation she'll grow it into\naggravation and give it back a few more\nvolleys like this and you're\nfunctionally Off to the Races so the way\nto never fight with a woman is to\nconstantly and consistently clarify your\ntone when speaking with one if it's\ncompletely devoid of negativity then\nthere won't be anything that she can\ngrow and reflect back to you that you\nwouldn't want to receive\nso if men don't want to fight with their\nwomen then where does this Tone come\nfrom to begin with the tone comes from a\nthought it's a dangerous thought because\nthe thought leads down the slippery\nslope toward an argument and it's a\nsimple thought I know you're going to\nrecognize it immediately when I point it\nout to you however this thought if\nunaddressed Will flues into a feeling\nwhich will leak out out into your\ncommunication as a tone so what's the\nThought when your woman comes to you and\nfor whatever reason she is provocative\nor complaining or needy or critical or\nwhat have you the Trap that gets sprung\nin your mind is some version of the\nthought I shouldn't have to deal\nwith this or ah Jesus Christ here we go\nagain or I can't believe this can I\nhave a moment of Peace in house or\nsomething along those lines and these\nthoughts and their variations are all\ntraps they are traps because as soon as\nyou validate these thoughts as true\nwhich if you're not careful can happen\nin the fraction of a second you are\ngoing to begin to experience\nimpatience which will seep into your\ntone as a kind of strained\nself-control this tone in turn is\nincubated and reflected which creates a\npositive feedback loop that eventually\nbursts into open hostility and this is\nhow men get suckered into fighting with\nwomen they can't tolerate their own\nimpatience and this is a problem because\nif you can't tolerate the initial\nprovocation how are you going to be able\nto tolerate the incubated and reflected\nversion if you appreciate the insights\non this channel I would highly encourage\nyou to get your hands on a copy of my\nbook\nthe value of others over the course of\n432 pages I delve deep into my economic\nmodel of relationships and explain the\nbehavior of both men and women in the\ngame of mating and dating I also provide\na lot of actionable advice on how to get\nand keep more of what you want in the\nsexual Marketplace once you read the\nvalue of others you'll never look at\nrelationships the same way again now\navailable in ebook Audi book and paper\nback formats the links are in the\ndescription so what's to be done about\nthis the way to prevent this outcome is\nto improve your kung fu your mental Kung\nFu anyway the secret to emotional\nequilibration is to maintain constant\nvigilance over the contents of your\nConsciousness behind every feeling is a\nthought and certain thoughts will\npredictably lead to certain emotional\nStates if you're able to root out those\nthoughts while they're still small they\nwon't have a chance to flues into\nemotions which means that you won't have\nto cope with them emotionally which is\ngenerally more timec consuming painful\nand expensive better to rip them out\nwhile they're still small and the way to\ndo this is through the block and replace\ntechnique you become aware of the\nthought I shouldn't have to deal\nwith\nthis well who says like where the\nis that written why shouldn't you have\nto deal with this since you're\napparently dealing with a woman who\nhasn't entirely clarified her own\ncommunication and you're dealing with\nyourself who has yet to cultivate\nsufficient patience to withstand her\nprovocations like are you sure you\nshouldn't have to deal with this under\nthose conditions expecting reality to be\nother than it is is just asking to be\ndisappointed and frustrated but whose\nfault is that do you understand what I'm\nsaying this is harsh but it's effective\nwhen a woman comes to you in this way\nyou have to understand that you are now\nin the emotional gym the physical gym is\nan actual location that we consciously\nand intentionally go to the emotional\ngym is a psychological location that\ncomes to us whether we're ready for it\nor not and the emotional gem comes to us\nwhen we start to become engaged with\nnegative emotional states when we start\nto give over onto loneliness or\nirritation anxiety or Despair and it's a\ngym precisely because it's the\nopportunity to strengthen the\ncommensurate virtue that will help you\ndefend against that particular weakness\nin the future which in this case would\nbe self-possession or patience or\ncourage or hope respectively after all\nhow can you grow these virtues if you\ndon't ever have the opportunity to\npractice them so these difficult\nsituations are the opportunity to grow\nstronger in the virtues that will defend\nyou against future difficulties it's\nsort of like building a tolerance to\npoison you can do it by exposing\nyourself to increasingly stronger doses\nto build up your ability to withstand\nits influence over time without that\nexposure you might be taken out by a\nsmall quantity of the substance but with\ngradual exposure even large doses might\nhave no effect on you it's also helpful\nto consider your woman in these moments\nat least to be your teacher she's your\nteacher because she's showing you where\nyou still have buttons to push and as\nfrustrating as this is this is actually\na very beneficial service that she's\nproviding your woman is teaching you\nthat you still have buttons to push in\nthe privacy of your own home and the\nrelative safety of your relationship so\nthat you do not need to learn that you\nstill have buttons to push out in the wi\nwider world where the stakes might be\nmuch higher in most cases the woman's\nmotivation here is not malicious however\neven if it is malicious she can still be\nyour teacher after all it's for you to\ndecide where you take your\nlessons in any case in these moments\nyour woman is pointing out where you are\nstill vulnerable where you are still\nsusceptible to attack where you still\nhave buttons that can be pushed and the\ncorrect response to a lesson even a\nlesson that you may not have wanted to\nlearn is\ngratitude thank you thank you teacher\nfor showing me that I still have this\nbutton I didn't realize H I thought I\nhad gotten them all but you know you\nhave helped me to see something that I\ncouldn't see for myself now when you\nfeel your buttons being pushed then do\nyour mental Kung Fu to prevent the\nfluoresence of the emotion and if the\nemotion presents itself use your\nemotional coping strategies to prevent\nthe situation from spiraling out of\ncontrol and help you return to Baseline\nand then further down the road when you\nhave the time and the space to do so you\nshould examine what happened like why do\nI have that button why did that prick my\nego why did that get under my skin so\nmuch really try to figure that out\nbecause by examining and processing your\nemotional response you can effectively\nremove that button from your\npsyche the goal of course is to become\nbuttonless or at the very least to\nremove that particular button from\ncommission the next time she goes\nlooking for that button you can't let\nher find it there now when she can't\nfind it she's GNA push harder to make\nsure that the button is really gone so\nyou have to be prepared for that but\nafter she pushes harder and realizes\nthat the button is really gone then\nshe's going to stop pushing she might\ntry to seek out another button to push\nbut she probably won't bother with the\none that is somehow\ndisappeared the idea is that a master\ncan turn anything to his purposes in\nthis way a good man can use even a\ndisrespectful and disagreeable woman to\nbecome emotionally resilient and\ninvulnerable what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and please send\nthis episode to someone who you
