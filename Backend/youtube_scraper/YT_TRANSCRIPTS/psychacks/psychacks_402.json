    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the Trap\nof the high value woman so I'm very\nhappy to report that I've been doing a\nlot of consultations with women these\ndays I love doing consultations with\nwomen because I love helping women see\nthings from a man's perspective this is\nimportant because just like in marketing\nyou kind of have to see things from the\nperspective of your potential customers\nso that you can make a value proposition\nthat resonates with them insisting that\npeople should simply buy what you're\nselling independent of their own wants\nand needs doesn't work so seeing things\nfrom a man's perspective will help women\nget the kinds of relationships that they\nwant from the men they want to have\nthose relationships with now a certain\nissue has come up repeatedly in these\nconsultations so I thought I'd make an\nepisode about it because if several\nwomen in the recent past have been\nstruggling with this issue chances are\nvery good that many many women are\ncurrently struggling with the same issue\nright now and it kind of goes like this\nusually these women come to me and they\nsay Orion I'm in my 30s and I understand\nthat my time is limited I'm ready to\nhave a family in the next year or two\nand I need your help to make that happen\nand I say great let me help you do that\nso let do a little role play let's say\nthat you're you and I'm the guy that you\nwant to make things happen with okay if\nyou come to me like this I'm going to\nsay something like all right I just met\nyou not too long ago and this is a\nlittle pushy but okay I'm willing to\nmove things along to fit your timeline\nlet's say I'm willing to give you a\nlifelong commitment and to provide for\nyou and the children I make a lot of\nmoney a lot more than you do which is\nprobably part of the reason why you\nsingled me out so your quality of life\nshould improve considerably if I take\nyou on now what will I expect to receive\nin\nreturn and this question stumps a lot of\nwomen usually they first come back with\nsome really highlevel stuff like I'm\nintelligent and educated and I would\nmake a really supportive partner and in\nmy roleplay I respond okay well that\nmight be the case but I already have a\nlot of support in my life I have a\ntherapist and a lawyer and a priest and\nvarious professional Consultants each\none is an expert in his or her field and\nare specialized in the functions they\nserve in my life no offense but I don't\nthink you're going to give me better\nadvice than they can in the domains in\nwhich I consult them so that's not\nactually something that I need from you\nand then the women start to coton on a\nbit and they say oh okay well I can give\nyou children right those people can't do\nthat and I respond well almost any woman\ncould give me children are you going to\nbe a mother are you willing to quit your\njob and raise those kids most of the\ntime the women are frightened by that\nProspect and they reply no I'm not\nwilling to give up my career or I would\nexpect you to do your share of the child\ncare too and so I counter so you're\ntelling me that you're willing to be a\nsurrogate and that I'll end up paying\nsomeone else to raise my children so\nthat you can make a little more money at\nyour\njob sometimes that irritates them and\nthey respond that they don't think it's\nfair that they should do all the child\ncare and that they're looking for a\n50/50 relationship and I reply that's\ntotally fair but that means that you\nshould probably be asking someone who\nmakes around the same as you do that way\nyou can both invest equally in the\nlifestyle that you jointly build that\nsaid you probably and understandably\nthink what's the point of getting\nmarried if it's not going to\nsignificantly improve my situation which\nis why you're talking to me and and not\nsome other guy and we go back and forth\nlike this for a while until eventually\nwe hit on the truth of the matter namely\nif I'm a high value guy the kind of guy\nthat you want to get married to and have\nchildren with the only way that you're\ngoing to get what you want is by\nproviding something that I don't already\nhave and the more I have the harder\nthat's going to be however in general\nthere are three things that a woman can\nprovide most straight high value men\nthey are one consistent fantastic sex\ntwo children and child rearing and three\nobedient agreeableness that improves his\nquality of life and to be honest men can\nactually buy all three of those things\nhowever there's still a lot of stigma in\njudgment about buying these three\nparticular things which actually creates\nan opportunity in the marketplace for\nwomen to potentially fill\nlet's focus on this last item a bit\nshall we obedient agreeableness that\nimproves his quality of life can look\nlike many things but two of the most\ncommon ways of doing this historically\nare cooking and\ncleaning oo okay the push back I\ntypically receive on this point is\nconsiderable and usually something on\nalong the lines of that is low value\nlabor Orion I'm not interested in being\nsomeone's maid or some man's mommy the\nman I want can afford a maid let him pay\nsomeone else if he wants his house\ncleaned and I say fair enough you have\nabsolutely no moral obligation to cook\nor clean for a man however I'd like you\nto consider that if a man pays for that\nservice that is one less way in which he\nmight need you you can look at these\ntasks like oppressive servitude or you\ncan see them as opportunities to\nintimately integrate yourself into the\nman's lifestyle remember the most\ndangerous man for a woman is the man who\nhas everything because if he has\neverything he doesn't need you for\nanything which means that you'll be a\nplay thing at\nbest next let's look a little closer at\nthis judgment you have about cooking and\ncleaning being beneath you as being low\nvalue labor let's imagine that we go out\nto a Michelin star restaurant for a real\nhigh-end dining experience the dinner\nwill be quite expensive and it may have\ntaken us months just to get a\nreservation and let's imagine that\nduring our dinner we call over our\nwaiter and ask for a glass of water and\nhe explains oh we don't serve water here\nthis is a high-end restaurant Resturant\nwe only serve champagne you can get\nwater anywhere and I would encourage you\nto take your business elsewhere if\nthat's what you're looking\nfor yeah how would that go over not well\nright what makes a high-end restaurant\nis not that it doesn't do what the\naverage restaurants do but that it does\neverything that the average restaurants\ndo and then some if all the other\nrestaurants serve water\nyou can't really get away with not\nserving water no restaurant is above the\nminimum standard of service the high-end\nones not only go above and beyond the\nminimum they also perform the standard\nof service with class you want a glass\nof water right away they'll put it in a\nnice glass with artisanal ice cubes and\na lemon wedge garnish they do low value\nstuff with enthusiasm and laity because\nit's the service that improves the\nquality of the experience which is what\nyou're paying for at a Michelin star\nrestaurant do you\nunderstand now let's be honest many of\nthese activities are greatly facilitated\nby modern technology between my\ndishwasher laundry machines and robot\nvacuums I personally keep a\nthree-bedroom house clean with maybe two\nactual hours of Labor a month a month\nwith grocery delivery services I can\nspend two hours a week preparing all my\nbreakfasts and lunches and a few more\ncooking a few dinners pitching in here\nand there is frankly not a very big ask\nwhich is why I argue that this\nresistance in women is an ego thing it's\nreally an issue of Pride and as I've\nsaid pride is women's greatest enemy\nit's the number one thing that keeps\nthem from getting into the relationships\nthey want with the men they want to have\nthe with look if you want to split the\nhousework and child care find your Dark\nHorse find a man who has about the same\nas you and build something together\nhowever if you're looking for a more\nsuccessful man to wife you up and give\nyou kids on your timeline you have to be\nprepared to provide value and this has\nto be a value that he finds valuable\nbecause the cat decides what milk is\ngood and all things being equal\nproviding obedient agreeableness is one\nof the easiest and cheapest and safest\nways of doing just that women find ways\nof doing this that work for you\nsomething to consider what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments below and if\nyou've gotten this far you might as well\nlike this episode And
