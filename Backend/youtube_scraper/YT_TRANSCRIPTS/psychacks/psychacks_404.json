    "transcript": "one of the most common reasons why guys\nreach out to me is because they are\nwanting to change a dysfunctional\ndynamic in their primary relationship or\nmarriage now if you're one of these guys\nI've got both good news and bad news for\nyou the good news is that it's possible\nyou can change even long-standing\nDynamics in your relationship however\nthe bad news is that it's very hard to\ndo it's always easier to do the right\nthing from the beginning than to do the\nwrong thing for years or decades and\nthen try to fix the problem so it's\ngoing to be tough what's more it's going\nto take some time it may not get all the\nway to where you want it to be and it\nwill always always get worse before it\ngets better so a lot of bad news but as\nlong as you're not in a hurry and you\nbrace yourself for the period of\ndiscomfort that comes after you begin to\ninitiate a change it's possible to alter\neven deeply ingrained Behavior patterns"
