    "transcript": "acting from a place of emotion often\nleaves you with consequences that far\nOutlast the emotion that originally\nproduce the impulse to act and that's a\nvery dangerous asymmetry like you can\nmake a decision in anger or fear or\nhopelessness once that will permanently\nchange the rest of your life it's not\nfair but that's the way it is people\nthink emotions are personal because only\nthey get to feel them however behind\nevery emotion is a thought and the\nthoughts that consistently create those\nemotions are impersonal if I were to\nthink the same thoughts and believe them\nto be true then the same emotion would\narise in me as well so we don't have to\nconsider emotions to be these inherently\nvaluable jewels that are more meaningful\nor significant than other aspects of our\nexperience in my opinion it's better to\nhold our emotions gently and to consider\nthem in light of multiple sources of\ninformation our reason our senses to\ndecrease the likelihood that we're being\nmisled"
