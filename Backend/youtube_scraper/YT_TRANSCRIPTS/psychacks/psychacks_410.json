    "transcript": "I need to be clear about something\nemotional Detachment does not mean that\nyou have no emotions unfortunately many\nmen do succeed in functionally divorcing\nthemselves from their emotional\nexperience however I believe that such\nmen do so at Great cost to themselves\nthis is because it generally requires\nsome degree of self-violence in order to\namputate a component of your lived\nexperience of course most men cannot do\nthis completely so they arrive at a\nplace where the only emotion that they\ncan consistently recognize is anger long\nperiods of a kind of numb neutrality are\npunctuated periodically with intense\nepisodes of anger and frustration and\nthat is no way to live life my friends\nfor me personally emotions make my life\nricher more interesting more enjoyable\nmore complex I like having emotions but\nI am also very emotionally detached\nemotional Detachment does not mean that\nyou sort of dissociate from your\nemotional experience or that you\nalienate yourself from your feeling\nsensitivity we do not want to become\nunfeeling rocks this is an extreme\nsolution"
