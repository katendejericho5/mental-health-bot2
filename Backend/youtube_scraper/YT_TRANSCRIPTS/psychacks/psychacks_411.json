    "video_title": "Should you really be PUNISHING your PARTNER?",
    "transcript": "should you really be punishing your\npartner it's generally not a very good\nidea for a number of reasons in the\nfirst place to the extent that it works\nit increases the power in balance in a\nrelationship why for the simple reason\nthat punishments can really only issue\nfrom the more powerful to the less\npowerful so the more you employ\npunishment the more powerful you become\nand the less powerful your partner\nbecomes which isn't usually sustainable\nas it leads to resentment on both sides\npunishers are resentful because they\nincreasingly feel parentified and\ncritical and punishes are resentful\nbecause they increasingly feel\ninfantilized and\ncriticized what a drag after all good\nrelationships are about enjoying who\nyour partner is not about changing them\ninto who you want them to be"
