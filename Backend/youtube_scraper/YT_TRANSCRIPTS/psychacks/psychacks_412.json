    "transcript": "emotional Detachment is an incredibly\nuseful skill in fact it might be the\nmost important emotional survival\nstrategy of which I am aware and I\napproach the concept of emotional\nDetachment through a Buddhist lens\nnamely through the realization that the\nuniverse is in a NeverEnding process of\nbecoming everything in this world is\nephemeral even now the present moment is\nchanging is dying is transforming into\nsomething else which will itself change\ndie\nand transform within this understanding\neverything that we have will eventually\nbe taken from us so why cling permanence\nis an illusion in the world Under the\nSun your property your relationships\nyour incarnate being you'll lose them\nall in the fullness of time so how will\nyou respond when it comes time to let\nthem go will you give back what you had\nwith gratitude for the time that you\nwere allowed to spend with it or will\nyou cling to it with an attachment that\nis as tenacious as it is futile"
