    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nunderstanding emotional Detachment so I\nthought this episode might be necessary\nafter conducting a recent consultation\nwith a well-spoken young man who watched\nmy episode How to Love Without emotional\nattachment and who came away with what I\nconsidered to be some misconceptions\nabout my message however I reasoned that\nif this intelligent guy had these\nmisconceptions then probably other\npeople did as well and that maybe my\nmessage wasn't entirely clear so I\nthought I would make a follow-up episode\nto critically examine emotional\nDetachment what it is and what it isn't\nemotional Detachment is an incredibly\nuseful skill in fact it might be the\nmost important emotional survival\nstrategy of which I am aware and I\napproach the concept of emotional\nDetachment through a Buddhist lens\nnamely through the realization that the\nuniverse is in a NeverEnding process of\nbecoming everything in this world is\nephemeral even now the present moment is\nchanging is dying is transforming into\nsomething else which will itself change\ndie and transform within this\nunderstanding everything that we have\nwill eventually be taken from us so why\ncling permanence is an illusion in the\nworld Under the Sun your property your\nrelationships your incarnate being\nyou'll lose them all in the fullness of\ntime so how will you respond when it\ncomes time to let them go will you give\nback what you had with gratitude for the\ntime that you were allowed to spend with\nit or will you cling to it with an\nattachment that is as tenacious as it is\nfutile futile because no amount of\ntenacity will succeed in holding\nsomething a moment longer than you\npossibly can on the other hand emotional\ndetach attachment is a skill that\nfacilitates surrender and surrender is\nsomething that we will eventually have\nto do with respect to everything that we\nhave been given including our own lives\nit's a way of holding things gently and\nthis is important because as I discussed\nin my episode hold people like sand the\ntighter you squeeze the more what you're\nholding tends to slip through your\nfingers now I need to be clear about\nsomething emotional Detachment does not\nmean that you have no emotions a\ncomplete absence of emotion in my\nopinion is not something we should be\nstriving for unfortunately many men do\nsucceed in functionally divorcing\nthemselves from their emotional\nexperience however I believe that such\nmen do so at Great cost to themselves\nthis is because it generally requires\nsome degree of self-violence in order to\namputate a component of your lived\nexperience of course most men cannot do\nthis completely so they arrive at a\nplace where the only emotion that they\ncan consistently recognize is anger long\nperiods of a kind of numb neutrality are\npunctuated periodically with intense\nepisodes of anger and frustration and\nthat is no way to live life my friends\nfor me personally emotions make my life\nricher more interesting more enjoyable\nmore complex I like having emotions but\nI am also very emotionally detached\nemotional Detachment does not mean that\nyou sort of dissociate from your\nemotional experience or that you\nalienate yourself from your feeling\nsensitivity we do not want to become\nunfeeling rocks this is an extreme\nsolution that said we also do not want\nthe Other Extreme solution which we\nmight call emotional\nFusion when a man is fused with his\nemotions there is no space between his\nfelt experience and his seat of being in\nEmotion Fusion the man is his emotional\nexperience if he feels something he not\nonly assumes that the emotion is\nJustified but that he must act on the\nemotion in some way this person has to\nsay his peace or wears his heart on his\nsleeve or generally rides the honic\nroller coaster he's Overjoyed when\nthings are going well and heartbroken\nand despondent when things don't go his\nway such men have no emotional\nDetachment and little\nself-control and and this is a terrible\nway of moving through the world for many\nreasons in the first place your emotions\nare not always justified in as much as\nthe model of reality from which your\nemotions arise may not be entirely\naligned with that reality and acting on\nthe basis of a flawed model is very\nlikely to create pain and suffering and\nin the second place emotions change even\nwhen they are Justified emotions are\nlike like the weather they're constantly\nshifting acting from a place of emotion\noften leaves you with consequences that\nfar Outlast the emotion that originally\nproduced the impulse to act and that's a\nvery dangerous asymmetry like you can\nmake a decision in anger or fear or\nhopelessness once that will permanently\nchange the rest of your life it's not\nfair but that's the way it is now before\nI go any further if you're liking what\nyou're hearing please consider sending\nthis episode to someone who might\nbenefit from its message because it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow you\ncan also hit the thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this message it's\nyour support that makes all of this\npossible I don't do corporate\nsponsorships or product placements so I\nreally do rely on you guys to help me\nmake all this happen and I really do\nappreciate their support thank\nyou now what should we do\ninstead it's a better idea to find some\nmiddle path between these two dangerous\nextremes and that middle path is\nemotional Detachment to begin with it\nhelps to not treat your emotions like\nthey're precious I discussed this in\nGreater detail in my episode emotions\nare impersonal people think emotions are\npersonal because only they get to feel\nthem however behind every emotion is a\nthought and the thoughts that\nconsistently create those emotions are\nimpersonal if I were to think the same\nthoughts and believe them to be true\nthen the same emotion would arise in me\nas well so we don't have to consider\nemotions to be these inherently valuable\njewels that are more meaningful or\nsignificant than other aspects of our\nexperience in my opinion it's better to\nhold our emotions gently and to consider\nthem in light of multiple sources of\ninformation our reason our senses to\ndecrease the likelihood that we're being\nmisled in this way we can consider\nemotions to be a source of information\namong many other sources of information\nand we can do this more easily by kind\nof observing our emotions at some remove\nlike you can remain still and unmoving\nin the seat of your being while\nsimultaneously watching your emotions\ncirculate through your body that's what\nI mean by emotional Detachment it's like\nexperiencing your emotions at arms\nlength and this allows you to consider\nthe information or even wisdom contained\nwithin them without allowing them to\npermeate your entire Consciousness if\nemotional Fusion is like drowning and\nemotional amputation is like staying as\nfar away from water as possible then\nemotional attachment is like swimming\nyou're in the water but you're not of\nthe\nwater and this is useful because our\nemotions are actually really important\nsources of information for us we\ntypically need our emotions in order to\nmake good decisions here's something you\nmight find interesting it's sometimes\nthe case usually as a consequence of\nsome tumor or growth that a person's\nlyic system the portion of the brain\nresponsible for emotional processing in\nmammals must be surgically removed as\nmight be expected these people don't\nexperience emotions after these\nprocedures but perhaps more unexpected\nthey also develop a terrible time making\ndecisions like if you were to put one of\nthese people in the cereal aisle of a\ngrocery store they would spend hours\ndebating what box of cereal to buy\nthey'll think okay this box is $4.25 and\nhas a net weight of 22 grams now this\none's a bit less expensive but it's net\nweight is proportionally lower so the\ncost per gram is actually 2 cents higher\nthat said it also has more niin per\nserving so the two cent per gram Savings\nin the one case might be more than\noffset by the relative deficiency in\nnasin and so on and so on and so on do\nyou see what I'm getting at in the\nabsence of emotion there is only factual\ninformation and the human mind is\nactually not great at keeping a lot of\nfactual information in its working\nmemory at any one time this creates\ninformation overload which in turn leads\nto analysis Paralysis on the other hand\na normal person just walks down the\nserial aisle and says ooo Lucky Charms\nand throws it in his cart and keeps on\nmoving people have to make like 10,000\ndecisions a day and most of these\ndecisions don't really matter this is\nwhere emotions come in one of the\nprimary functions of emotions is to\nserve as heuristics in decisionmaking\nallowing us to navigate the World by\nexpending fewer cognitive resources\npeople who don't have access to their\nemotions struggle to make decisions\nand that's because decision is an act of\nthe will and has more to do with emotion\nthan thought so that's emotional\nDetachment the ability to observe your\nemotional experience at some remove this\nwill allow you to access the information\ncontained within your emotions without\nnecessarily acting upon them you can\nfeel the emotional impulse to act\nwithout relenting to it this requires\nsome measure of self-discipline but like\nany other virtue you strengthen it by\npracticing it by not clinging to your\nown emotional experience you will\nincreasingly learn to allow things to\ncome and go which in turn will help you\nto be more present more grateful and\nultimately more loving in your\nrelationships hopefully that clears a\nfew things up what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow
