    "transcript": "in a highly simplified version it breaks\ndown like this men are trying to get as\nmuch sex as possible from women for the\nleast amount of time energy and money\nand women are trying to get as much time\nenergy and money from men for the least\namount of sex this is obviously an\noversimplification but there must be at\nleast some truth to it because we\ntypically don't see the roles reversed\nso when a man is actually in a\nrelationship with you in that he's\ntaking you out on dates and listening to\nyour problems and meeting your family\nand taking you on trips and supporting\nyou emotionally in short when he is\nheavily investing time energy and money\ninto you and then he learns that you\n[ __ ] a guy that you met at a bar an\nhour ago and who ghosted you the next\nday he's going to feel like a total\nschmuck for overpaying for something\nthat you are obviously willing to sell\nfor a fraction of the price and I\nguarantee that will change the way he\nperceives you forever"
