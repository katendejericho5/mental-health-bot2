    "transcript": "Brad has a great question so if women\nwant to be led why do they fight back so\nmuch all right that's a good question\nthe reason why a woman might fight back\nagainst a man's attempt to lead the\nrelationship is she's not yet sure you\ncan do it so if she was already very\nsure you she wouldn't be fighting you\nbut the vast majority of in the vast\nmajor of cases a woman isn't sure yet\nand so she's going to test the dude to\nsee if he actually has the traits and\nthe capabilities to lead the\nrelationship you can think of it like\ntaking a car for a test drive when you\ntake a car for a test drive a couple\nthings are true one you're a fairly\nmotivated buyer people do not test drive\nfor fun people test drive cars it\ndoesn't necessarily mean they're going\nto buy that car but they are definitely\nin the market to buy a car and this is\non their short list a woman testing you\nis actually a very good sign because it\nexhibits that she is highly interested\nin moving forward with the transaction"
