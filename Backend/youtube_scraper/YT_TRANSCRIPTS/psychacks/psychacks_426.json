    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nunderstand people now on some level\neveryone is a psychologist because\neveryone is trying to understand other\npeople specifically they want to\nunderstand other people because they\nwant to be able to predict their\nbehavior and to get what they want from\nthem and this is a worthwhile Pursuit\nbecause the more you understand yourself\nand the more you understand other people\nthe more you can get what you want from\nlife now there are many many popular\nFrameworks for understanding people that\nexist in the world today these are\nthings like attachment Styles Myers\nBriggs personality types and Love\nLanguages just to name a few there are\nliterally thousands of formal and\ninformal measures of individual\npersonality a few of these enjoy a\nrobust body of substantiating evidence\nlike attachment Styles but even these\ntend to be inappropriately\novergeneralized the vast majority of\nthese measures however are basically\nglorified horoscopes and they are\npopular for the same reason astrology is\npeople love hearing about themselves\nsome of them are interesting and most of\nthem are harmless but it's probably best\nnot to put too much stock in them that\nsaid trying to understand other people\nthrough the lens of the individual that\nis through the lens of his or her\npersonality or in psychic Dynamics is\nkind of a trap\nit doesn't really work the idea for\nexample that if I understand my\npartner's Big Five personality traits or\ntheir Love Languages or their Myers\nBriggs or their star signs I will then\nbe able to successfully navigate a\nrelationship with them and get what I\nwant is fundamentally flawed in the vast\nmajority of cases this doesn't\nwork and that's because all of these\npersonality metrics they kind of only\nexist in a vacuum to the extent that\nthey work they they describe a\nperson divorced and isolated from\nculture context and Circumstance and\nthat is not the world in which people\noperate and it's not the world in which\nwe actually have to navigate\nrelationships For Better or Worse a much\nmuch better predictor of behavior than\nany of those other metrics are\nincentives if you can understand the\nincentives under which other people are\noperating then you won't be a B to\npredict their behavior with far greater\naccuracy than you would if you had all\nthat other personality data combined\nthis is because the vast majority of\npeople respond to specific incentives in\nexactly the same way we're most of us\nnot as unique and individual as we think\nwe are to use a very extreme example the\nvast majority of people would give you\nwhat you wanted if you were to put a gun\nto their heads introvert or extrovert\nHigh eroticism or low in\nconscientiousness INTP or ENFJ sun in\nLeo or moon in Capricorn they're all\ngoing to hand over their wallets and it\nwould be hard to predict which in a\ngroup of people wouldn't act this way\njust given their personality data and\nplease do not put guns to people's heads\nmy point here is that when the\nincentives are sufficient to motivate\naction none of that other stuff really\nmatters so to understand other people\nyou have to understand the incentives\nunder which they are currently operating\nand when it comes down to it there are\nonly two things that motivate action the\ncarrot which is reward and the stick\nwhich is punishment or to put it another\nway Pleasure and Pain different people\nconsider different things rewards and\npunishments and that's the origin of the\nvariability in human action but all\npeople navigate the world according to\nthese two po stars now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message I don't do\ncorporate sponsorships or product\nplacements so I really do rely on your\ncontributions to help keep all this\nrunning I really thank you for your\nhelp now the first thing you have to\nunderstand about incentives is that\nthey're not equal as I discussed in the\nbalance of Pleasure and Pain these two\nthings are\nasymmetrical for whatever reason humans\nhave been constructed such that pain is\nmore painful than pleasure is\npleasurable this means among other\nthings that people will do more to avoid\npain than they will to secure pleasure\nthis is why according to John gottman's\nresearch a relationship must have at\nleast five pleasurable interactions for\nevery painful one to justify its\ncontinued existence so if we were to\nkind of extrapolate from that finding we\ncan tentatively conclude that pain is\nlike five times more painful than\npleasure is pleasurable and that\nprobably means that the stick is five\ntimes more motivating than the carrot is\nit is what it is in any case this means\nthat if you understand the various\nincentives the rewards and punishments\nunder which people are operating then\nyou can predict their behavior with a\nhigh degree of accuracy without knowing\nanything else about them now the second\nthing you have to understand is that\nmost people don't see reality clearly\nthey don't in fact most people are kind\nof sleepwalking through life in a kind\nof Quasi hypnotic state so what does\nthis mean this means that with respect\nto what we're talking here a stick\ndoesn't really have to be a stick a\ncarrot doesn't really have to be a\ncarrot in actuality a stick only needs\nto be a stick in someone's mind to\nfunction as a punishment and a carrot\nonly needs to be a carrot in someone's\nmind to function as a reward and in many\ncases psychological sticks and carrots\nare far more effective than our actual\nsticks and carrots in\nreality this means to Be an Effective\npsychologist you have to be able to see\nthe world through the framework of a\ngiven individual's perception within\nthat perception there will be\npsychological carrots and psychological\nsticks that do not exist in objective\nreality but that nonetheless exert an\nenormous influence over that\nindividual's Behavior to give just one\nconcrete example consider how people\npleasing behavior develops in certain\nindividuals because these folks have a\ndistorted view of other people's\ndisappointment that it is far more\ndangerous or threatening than it likely\nis in in reality that person is going to\nexperience the disappointment of others\nas this enormous stick the stick doesn't\nreally exist in objective reality but\nthat doesn't matter it only needs to\nexist within the framework of their\nperception and once you appreciate the\nmagnitude of that stick then their\nbehavior makes sense within their\npsychology they are appropriately\nresponding to avoid an enormous\npunishment that would otherwise be fall\nthem if they were to disappoint an\nimportant other their reasoning is\nfairly rational what's irrational is\ntheir\nperception a lot of the work I do as a\npsychologist has to do with helping\npeople see that a lot of the carrots and\nsticks that they're responding to only\nexist in their perception and not in\nlet's say veritical reality and this is\nthe key to understanding people if you\ncan understand the incentives that exist\nwithin their perception then you will be\nable to predict their Behavior very\naccurately it's also the key to getting\nwhat you want from other people apply\nthe right carrots and the right sticks\nat the right time and you can get pretty\nmuch anything from anyone you're really\nonly limited by the punative function of\nsociety and your own conscience and\nunderstanding which sticks are punishing\nand which carrots are rewarding to\nspecific others is far more useful than\nunderstanding that they are an anchor or\nan infj or any other label floating\naround in popular psychology that's\nalmost all incentives are what\nmatter if you understand incentives you\nunderstand people what do you think does\nthis fit with your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and if
