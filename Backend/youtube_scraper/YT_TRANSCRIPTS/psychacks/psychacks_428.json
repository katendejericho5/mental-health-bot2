    "transcript": "and just what is it that works in the\npeople that you're not attracted to and\nthat will work on the people that you\nare if you use it indifference it's the\ntake it or leave it attitude that\nincreases attraction yeah they're nice\nyeah there's nothing wrong with them and\nyeah there's probably somebody better\nout there that's the attitude you spend\ntime with them great and if you don't\nyou're not really going to miss them\nyou're certainly not going to pursue\nthem or worry about them or anxiously\nwait by the phone that the correct\nattitude to have toward the people that\nyou're attracted to this isn't easy at\nfirst and it's probably not going to\nfeel very authentic however you don't\nnecessarily just abandon what works in\nother parts of your life because you\nfeel a certain the good news is that you\nalready know that this approach works\nbecause it's likely already achieved the\ndesired result albeit with the undesired\nTarget many times in your past so it's a\npretty low-risk proposition"
