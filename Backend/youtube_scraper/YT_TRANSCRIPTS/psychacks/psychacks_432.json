    "transcript": "everything that you can get from another\nperson in a relationship has a\ntransacted value and can be bought that\ndoesn't necessarily mean bought with\nmoney but it can mean that you can buy\nsex you can buy companionship you can\nbuy emotional support and child care and\nhome cook meals you can even buy\nchildren through adoption or surrogacy\nyou can buy everything that can be\ntransacted in a human relationship\nhowever you can't buy love and that is\nbecause paradoxically love is valueless\nVal in the sense that it is free and\nvalueless in the sense that it cannot be\nbought at any price on the other hand if\nyou want love you don't need a\nrelationship why listen carefully if\nlove is wanting the best for the loved\none you can only reasonably want a\nrelationship with the loved one if a\nrelationship with you is literally the\nbest possible thing for the loved one\nand let's be real it probably isn't"
