    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nhaacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nhow to get any man you want the\nunbreakable rule okay so this is the\nthird episode in a three-part series\nentitled how to get any man you want\nthis series is for the ladies and it was\ncreated in response to your popular\ndemand here's the thing men are not that\ncomplicated if you are single and you do\nnot want to be it is your fault ladies\nit all begins with accepting\nresponsibility for that fact just like\nit's the man's fault if he cannot be\nsufficiently attractive to a woman to\nsecure the sexual opportunity it is your\nfault if you cannot be sufficiently\nattractive to a man to secure the\ncommitment opportunity it's on you\nfortunately I'm here to help now to get\nany man you want you only really need to\ndo three things in my first episode I\ntalked about the first thing you need to\nbe useful it's by being useful that you\ncan insinuate yourself so completely\ninto the day-to-day operation of a man's\nlife that it would be next to impossible\nto get rid of you that's de facto\ncommitment in the second episode I\ntalked about the second thing you have\nto be the nastiest version of\nyourself possible it's by doing things\nwith him sexually that you have done\nwith other men and ideally that he\nhasn't done with other women that you\nwill most effectively communicate your\ninterest and attraction satisfy his\nlibido proactively and due to the\nrefractory period you've got de facto\nexclusivity and in this episode I'm\ngoing to talk about the third thing the\nunbreakable Rule now I'm sure a number\nof you women watched those first two\nepisodes and said to yourselves Orion\nthat's not it I did both of those things\nlook at me I look good no man has ever\nhad complaints in the sexual Department\nI take care of all that and I do\neverything for my man I cook I clean I\nlook after his kids I do his taxes I\nmean like Orion you do not know what you\nare talking about I've done both of\nthose things and it still doesn't\nwork\nokay I believe you if you did the first\ntwo things and it still didn't work\nthere are only two real possib\npossibilities here the first possibility\nis that you have a love savior complex\nthis is basically the female equivalent\nof the white night complex in men you\nchoose messed up project men who you\nthink you can improve through the\nhealing power of your love this is the\nBeauty and the Beast delusion and it\ndoesn't work I mean it's a fairy tale\nladies it's not meant to be taken\nliterally if this is you just like those\nwhite- knighted men you have to take a\ndeep Long look at yourselves and heal\nwhatever part of you believes that you\nare not enough fix yourselves and you\nwon't have to fix men so that's the\nfirst possibility but to be honest the\nsecond possibility is much more likely\nif you're still not with the man you\nwant it's very likely that you're in\nthis situation because you violated the\nunbreakable rule this means that you did\nthe one thing that you absolutely\npositiv weren't supposed to do which is\nwhat this episode is about this rule is\na trump card if you violate this rule it\ndoesn't matter if you do the other two\nthings and I know for a fact that there\nare a lot of you out there breaking the\nunbreakable rule you might be doing it\nright now that's how common it is so\nwhat's this unbreakable rule to\nparaphrase Solomon purportedly the\nwisest man who has ever lived a wise\nwoman builds a house with her hands and\ntears it down with her\nmouth with her mouth the reason ladies\nwhy you are still single after doing the\nother two things is because you ran your\nmouth the unbreakable rule is that you\ncan't ever disrespect the man you want\nto be with period you have to remove\nevery single iota of disrespect from\nyour communication it's a going out of\nbusiness sale it's all got to go this\nmeans not a single critical word or a\ncontemptuous glance or an impatient sigh\nit's all got to be exercised from your\ncommunication and if you don't do this\nyou will continue to snatch defeat from\nthe jaws of success time and time again\nnow before I go go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you may also consider\nhitting the thanks button and tipping me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this episode it's\nyour support that helps make all of this\npossible I really appreciate it now let\nme go off script for a moment and give\nyou an example of what I was talking\nabout many years ago uh a female who was\nclose to me gave me a\nall distraught apparently her boyfriend\nhad taken her out for dinner on\nValentine's Day and as they were eating\ndinner in the middle of the restaurant\napparently this man just decided to\nstart yelling and screaming at her and\nberating her and criticizing her before\nstorming out of the\nrestaurant and this woman was distraught\nand wanting to know how she might\nnavigate this situation and I began by\nresponding okay I don't really believe\nthat that's how things went down she\nsaid well what do you mean I said I\ndon't know this guy but I doubt that\nhe's psychotic and a normal adult man\ndoes not just sit in the middle of a\npublic restaurant and start yelling and\nscreaming at his woman on Valentine's\nDay so there must I'm not saying he\nshould have been screaming at you I\nwasn't there but there had to have been\nsomething that you said or did\nthat triggered that interaction and that\nsuggestion that there was something that\nthat woman might have said or did to set\nthis guy off set her off again and she\nstarted yelling and screaming at me why\nyou take this man's position I can't\nbelieve you would take his side and she'\nhang up on me and and that was the end\nof that so it's like not only do women\noften not appreciate that they might be\ncontributing to their own difficulties\nthey don't want to hear how they might\nbe contributing to their own\ndifficulties even when they ask for how\nthey are contributing to their\ndifficulties so I'm going to take one\nfor the team here because I'm on a\nscreen so you can't really you know come\nafter me um because I'm going to tell\nyou the things that a lot of men might\nhave tried to tell you in the past but\nyou might not have reacted um in a\npositive way to that feedback okay all\nright women the I have heard you\nsay in my lifetime if I were to say to\nanother man I would get knocked into\nnext week you have to understand\nthat a man is like both an angel and an\nanimal we're not all good and we're not\nall bad and the animal is going to\nrespond how you would expect an animal\nto respond disrespecting criticizing or\nattacking a man is going to arouse the\nanimal in him expressing contempt for a\nman well at the same time expecting that\nhe exercise perfect Angelic patience and\nself Transcendence with you doesn't make\na lot of sense does it you wouldn't go\naround slapping rattlesnakes or mocking\ngrizzly bears or shaming wild dogs would\nyou we wouldn't say there was anything\nfragile about those animals if they were\nto respond in line with their Natures\nwould we now I am definitely not\nadvocating that men respond to women's\nattacks in kind in any way men should\nnever fight with a woman ever it's just\nnot worth it because there's no real way\nto win so if men can't really respond\nand women continue with the disrespect\nwhat's the only thing that men can\ndo\nleave which is what they do no amount of\nsex or assistance is enough to\ncompensate for a disrespectful woman and\nit's a very stupid woman who forces a\nman to choose\nbetween her and his own Peace of Mind\nespecially since other women exist who\nwill not force him to make that\ndecision now does this mean that you\nhave to like everything that your man\ndoes no does this mean that you have to\nagree with everything your man thinks no\ndoes this mean that you have to turn a\nblind eye to every mistake he makes\ndefinitely not but does this mean that\nyou have to find ways to differ disagree\nand correct without disrespecting him\nABS\nlutely and you can do it respect is a\nquality of action if you can do\nsomething disrespectfully I guarantee\nthat you can do the same thing\nrespectfully so you're going to need to\nremove all the disrespectful components\nof your Communication in order to get\nand keep the man that you want and for\nthe record this doesn't just mean\ncommunication with the man in question\nit means all of your communication about\nthe man in question to your friends your\nfamily your co-workers do not complain\nabout your man to other people it's a\nbad look ladies because who the\nchose that man did he Bonk you on the\nhead and drag you off like a caveman it\nwas your choice to be with that guy you\nworked to get him in most cases so\ntalking behind a man's back only\nmakes you look foolish and of course all\nof that talk eventually gets back to the\nguy anyway\nthe way to keep yourself safe here\nladies is to pretend that you're talking\nto whoever you're talking about again\npretend you're talking to whoever you're\ntalking about follow this advice and it\nwill be much much harder for you to\nbreak the unbreakable rule finally women\nyou may need to appreciate that you\ncould be communicating disrespect to men\nin unintentional ways remember in this\ncase it doesn't matter whether or not\nyou think something is disrespectful it\nmatters whether he thinks something is\ndisrespectful the cat decides what milk\nis good you can see my episode respect\nmeans different things to men and women\nfor more on this topic the easiest way\nto approach how men understand respect\nis to examine the military militaries\nare created by men for men and they\ncodify all kinds of masculine ideals\nhonor Duty status and respect and the\neasiest way for anyone to mentally test\nwhether or not some Behavior could be\nconstrued as disrespectful is to imagine\nwhether or not you would do that with a\nsuperior officer ladies if you wouldn't\nsay that in that way to your boss or\nyour Co then do not say that in that way\nto your man that's the unbreakable rule\nyou can't ever disrespect the man you\nwant to be with not once this means\nwords this means gestures facial\nexpressions tones of voice this means\nthings you do and things you passively\naggressively don't do get rid of it all\nyou can keep your man or you can keep\nyour disrespect but you may not be able\nto keep both the choice is yours so\nlet's recap women can get any man that\nthey have direct access to even if\nthey're not extremely attractive the\nmaster key the way to get your foot in\nthe door is to be useful because that\nallows you to enter into progressively\nmore intimate dimensions of his life\nonce you're there the hook the way to\ncapture a man is to be the nastiest\n version of yourself because\nthis is the principal thing a man can\nget from you that he can't get anywhere\nelse and finally you keep your position\nby honoring the unbreakable rule\neliminating every single form of\ndisrespect from your communication if\nyou follow these three steps then you\ntoo can get any man that you want\nguaranteed what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis
