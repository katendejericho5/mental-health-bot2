    "transcript": "this is where a lot of guys get into\ntrouble because men in part due to their\ntemperament and in part due to\nsocialization are generally not very\nemotionally expressive what's more a man\nisn't always prepared to engage with a\nwoman more or less on demand sometimes\nhe's tired sometimes he's preoccupied\nsometimes he just wants to be left alone\nin fact there seem to be some important\ngender differences in how men and women\ntend to respond to emotional stressors\nwhereas women generally prefer to talk\nthings out in order to feel better men\noften prefer to like withdraw into the\nBatcave to solve the problem men like to\ngo inside to isolate to incubate and to\nresolve the problem internally before\nemerging with a solution or at least a\nplan of action of course it would be\nvery helpful for women to understand\nthat when men are disinterested in\ninteracting with them it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that they have a\nproblem with them they just have a\nproblem it's occupying their attention\nand they don't want to cope with the\nproblem in the same way that women do"
