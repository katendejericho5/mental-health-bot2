    "transcript": "why is it that your woman seems to\ncreate unnecessary difficulties why does\nshe pick fights over small and\ninsignificant things the key to\nunderstanding this phenomenon is\nappreciating that emotion is reinforcing\nI didn't say positive emotion was\nreinforcing I said emotion was\nreinforcing emotion of all kinds is\nreinforcing to women you see this kind\nof response in children as well for\nexample most children would rather\nexperience negative attention than no\nattention at all and this is what in\npart creates class clowns in grade\nschool or rebellious teenagers and\nadolesence they would rather experience\na parents annoyance or judgment or anger\nor even rejection than being\nfunctionally invisible to them so\nemotion is reinforcing that is it's\nrewarding"
