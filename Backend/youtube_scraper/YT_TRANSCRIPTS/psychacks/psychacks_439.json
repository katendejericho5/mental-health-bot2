    "transcript": "just like men have to practice being\nselfish they need to practice gratifying\nthemselves otherwise they either end up\nforfeiting gratification entirely or\nthey dramatically increase the chances\nof one day exploding in some kind of\ngluttonous orgy now this explosion could\nbe a lesson that can be learned from it\ncould be a step in the direction of\nresponsible self-gratification a phase\nthat most people have to pass through\nhowever the sudden forceful nature of\nmany midlife crises is such that they\ncan be very difficult to recover from\nmany women aren't going to like support\na man through this process especially if\nspoiler alert they have been the primary\nbeneficiaries of the man's service and\ngratification delay over the years in\nany case I believe it's important for\nmen to cultivate that creative\nselfishness throughout their lives if\nthey ask what about me earlier they are\nsignificantly less likely to find\nthemselves in a lifestyle that doesn't\nwork for them and if they practice\ngratifying themselves along the way they\nprobably won't need to make themselves\nsick when eventually given the\nopportunity to eat"
