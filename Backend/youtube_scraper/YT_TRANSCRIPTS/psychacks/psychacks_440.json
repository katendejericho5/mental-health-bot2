    "transcript": "regardless of how he or she may have\ntreated you regardless of how he or she\nmay have hurt you and regardless of how\nhe or she may have ended things practice\nis to cultivate gratitude for what good\nwas in the relationship and to begin\nslowly over time to approach the idea of\nwishing this person well of wanting this\nperson to heal of hoping this person\ndoes not suffer just as you might wish\nand want and hope those things for\nyourself or even all living things in\nBuddhism this is called a loving\nkindness meditation this is not the same\nthing as condoning what happened the\nidea is to completely divest yourself of\nthe negative emotions that cause you to\ncling to the Lost object gentleness is\nwhat facilitates\nunclenching it's the soft positive\nemotions like gratitude compassion and\nlove that allow you to unclench to\nactually let go"
