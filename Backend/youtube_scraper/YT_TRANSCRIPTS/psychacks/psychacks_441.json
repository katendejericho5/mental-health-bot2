    "transcript": "and isn't it bad to be selfish no no\nit's not because selfishness is\nultimately connected to the survival and\nflourishing of the individual organism\ntrying to remove this inborn\ncharacteristic of human nature could\nvery well create more problems than it\nsolves can selfishness be taken too far\nabsolutely but when I look around at\nHumanity I actually don't see that to be\nthe issue if anything I don't think\npeople are selfish enough about their\nown happiness and well-being they\ncertainly don't act that way they're not\nthey're not flourishing they're not\nthey're not demanding the best of\nthemselves in any case I don't think\nthat selfishness can be completely\neradicated and if it's repressed for 30\nyears then it's going to most likely\nerupt in forceful ways and at\ninopportune moments some selfishness\nalong the way probably serves the\nfunction of a release valve preventing\nthe buildup of an unsustainable pressure\na Man Who develops and cultivates his\nselfishness probably isn't going to\nexplode in an origy of adolescent\nselfishness when he is 45"
