    "transcript": "the ability to let go of someone is an\nemotional survival technique I remember\nthat I was in a wake of a significant\nheartbreak many years ago the\nrelationship and ended poorly and I was\nexperiencing a whole host of emotions a\nlot of hard feelings mixed up in my\nlonging and desire for this reason it\nwas very difficult for me to emotionally\ndisentangle myself from the memory of\nthis person and I remember going to a\ngood friend and mentor and disclosing\nwhat I was going through and he told me\nsomething that has stuck with me ever\nsince he told me that the only way to\nlet go of someone is with love negative\nemotions kind of cause us to emotionally\nclench around the idea or the memory of\na person and you can't let go of\nsomething that you're simultaneously\nclinging to the way to let go is to\nsoften and\nrelax this entails cultivating an\nattitude of love and compassion relative\nto the Lost object"
