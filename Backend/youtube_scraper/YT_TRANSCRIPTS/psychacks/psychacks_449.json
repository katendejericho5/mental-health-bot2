    "transcript": "there's nothing wrong with young men per\nse but in general women don't want them\nthey have no wealth or status or\nexperience and there's nothing wrong\nwith older women per se but in general\nmen don't want them they're not as\nphysically attractive as their younger\ncompetition so what you have are two\ngendered classes at two different stages\nof their lives that are generally\nequivalent with respect to their\nnormalized sexual Marketplace values so\nit kind of makes sense that they would F\neach other now this Dynamic younger man\nolder woman\nis really good for the short term like a\nfew years Max and that's because on some\nlevel both parties know that starting a\nfamily is probably not in the cards um\nand that works both ways the woman\nprobably isn't going to want to\nreproduce with a young guy in his early\n20s who may not have a job or a career\nor much in terms of material prospects\nand vice versa the man probably isn't\ngoing to want to take on that kind of\nresponsibility with a woman who's\nnearing the end of her biological window"
