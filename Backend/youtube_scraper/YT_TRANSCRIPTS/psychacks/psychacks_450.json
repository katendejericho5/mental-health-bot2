    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taband and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is you're\nonly as good as your routines this\nepisode was inspired by my recent\ntravels in Japan something about me is\nI'm constantly in the process of\nexperimentation and I've recently been\nexperimenting with new ways of living\nand part of this experiment was to take\na month off which I haven't done since I\nstarted working over 20 years ago and\nspend some time living like a local in\nJapan I visited Japan many years ago and\nI loved it it's an enchanting place and\nin my opinion it's one of the best\ncultures that exists on the planet today\nso I wanted to see what it would be like\nto spend an extended period of time\nthere and on the whole I had a fantastic\ntime however as the month went on I\nfound my mood beginning to deteriorate\nand this was surprising to me as I was\nostensibly on holiday doing whatever it\nwas that I wanted to do whenever I\nwanted to do it I was having new\nexperiences and eating great food and\ngenerally having fun but I frankly\nwasn't feeling feeling as well inside of\nmyself as I do when I'm back home living\nmy little day-to-day life and that's\nwhen it kind of clicked for me and I\nrealized that a lot of my sense of self\na lot of my emotional regulation a lot\nof my self-esteem a lot of my happiness\nand satisfaction and joy actually come\nfrom the structure I have created over\nthe years and the routines that I have\ncultivated in my daily daily life like I\nalready knew this intellectually but\nthis trip really helped me understand\nthis more deeply on an emotional level\nand then kind of makes sense because as\nan entrepreneur I've been able to Custom\nTailor nearly every aspect of my life\nover the years to my personal preference\nso my day-to-day life really works for\nme because I was moving around from\nplace to place in Japan I didn't have\nconsistent access to a gym so my\nexercise routines fell off and because I\nwas staying in short-term rentals I\ndidn't have access to a good kitchen so\nI wasn't cooking my own meals and\nbecause I was in a country where I\ndidn't speak the native language it was\nmuch more difficult for me to make\nconnections with the people I was\nmeeting so I wasn't supported by my\nfriends and confidants and because the\nconstant travel demanded that I be at\ncertain places at certain times my sleep\nweight Cycles were disrupted so I wasn't\nfeeling as rested and focused as I\nusually do it might sound boring but in\nmy day-to-day life I often do the same\nexact thing every single day I wake up\nat the same time every day I make the\nsame breakfast every day I start work at\nthe same time every day not because\nanyone is telling me I have to be\nanywhere at any given time that might\nactually be easier to maintain but\nbecause I'm telling myself where I need\nto be at any given moment of the day and\nthis consistency kind of helps me stay\nin the zone it allows me to dependably\nperform at a very high level day after\nday I also noticed that after two weeks\nI really started to miss my work this is\nbecause I don't really think of my work\nas a job yeah it's the primary source of\nmy income but it also gives me so much\nfulfillment and it provides me with\nmeaning and connection and inspiration\nand it's intellectually stimulating and\nemotionally rewarding I usually feel\nbetter at the end of my workday than I\ndo at the beginning of it that's that's\nthe truth I don't feel like I need to\ntake time away from my work anymore than\nI feel like I need to take time away\nfrom fulfillment connection and\nstimulation in many respects I might\nneed that work more than that work needs\nme so what's the upshot here well after\nkind of patting myself on the back for\nmaking good choices with respect to my\nlifestyle and my line of work I had to\ncome to grips with the fact that a lot\nof my satisfaction and performance had\nless to do with me like with factors\nthat inhere in myself like intelligence\nor creativity or what have you and more\nto do with the structures in which I\nroutinely find myself basic stuff like\nsleeping eating exercising sex and\nconnection these things regulate my\nemotion and clarify my thinking more\nthan I think I previously appreciated\nit's not like I had some kind of\nmeltdown or breakdown when they were\ndisrupted but the change in me wrought\nby their disruption was not\ninsignificant and it only took about 3\nweeks for me to start to feel the\nnegative effects of that disruption now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really helped to make the channel\ngrow and you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nepisode I really depend on your support\nand your donations because it makes\neverything here happen I really thank\nyou now all of this made me think of the\nmillions of men out there who are\nstruggling with depression struggling\nwith low self-esteem and purposelessness\nand dejection men who just feel shitty\nin their own subjective experience and I\nthought wow if I don't feel great when I\ndeviate from my routines for like two\nweeks how would it feel to deviate from\nmy routines for years how would it feel\nnot to have a structure to begin with\nand I think it would feel a lot like\ndepression which I experienced very\nintensely when I was younger and my life\nwas a mess I think there's a connection\nthere it's like of course how can anyone\nfeel good inside themselves when they\nare not supported by these structures\nthese routines I just don't think it's\nreally possible for the vast majority of\npeople I don't think we're like\nhardwired to be able to do that my dudes\nyou are only as good as your routines\nallow you to be what do you do every\nsingle day tell me what you do\nrepeatedly and I'll tell you how happy\nyou probably\nare these things are more responsible\nfor your quality of life then you likely\ngive them credit for and if your\ndepression leads you to contact a\ntherapist and that person doesn't ask\nyou about your sleep and your nutrition\nand your exercise and your relationships\nand your work and your sex life then\nyou're not really talking to a therapist\nyou're talking to a drug dealer and\nthat's exactly the solution they're\ngoing to offer you as I discussed in a\nprevious episode it's important to rule\nout the confounds if you have all of\nthese things dialed in and taken care of\nand you're still not feeling very hot\nthen there might be other things to\nconsider but why not rule out the things\nthat we know for a fact significantly\nimpact mood and\ncognition first like things that frankly\nyou may not need to pay a therapist for\nbefore you hire the services of a\nprofessional like how could that be bad\nfor you A lot of people especially young\npeople and especially young men have\ndifficulties with the idea of structure\nthey only view it in its restrictive\nattribute uh like a cage or a cell the\nbest model I have for structure is a\nskeleton without a skeleton you're just\na puddle on the floor you're not\ngoing to move and you're not going to\nget anywhere it's your structure your\nskeletal system that allows you to stand\nupright and that creates the opportunity\nfor Locomotion for movement in your life\nwithout that structure you're a soft bag\nof flesh wriggling on the floor so get\nyour routines down gentlemen Channel\nyour inner Postman and do it in spite of\nyour feelings do this and your habits\nwill eventually move you forward when\nyou're finding it hard to carry on\nsupport the Habit so the habit can\nsupport you it might be hard at the\nbeginning but it's probably hard anyway\nso what do you have to lose what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far
