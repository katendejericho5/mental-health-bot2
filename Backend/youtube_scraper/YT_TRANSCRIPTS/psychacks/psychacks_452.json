    "transcript": "so many my advice to you is to look for\nyour ugly duck this is an illusion to\nthat Hans Christian Anderson story about\na weird looking duck who grew up to be a\nbeautiful Swan some women Blossom at\ndifferent stages in life and I've dated\nsome very very attractive women who\ndidn't really come into their own into\ntheir late 20s or even their early 30s I\nknow this because i' I've seen their\npictures and I honestly think they're\nbetter looking today than they were 10\nyears ago and these women have all been\nsignificantly easier and more satisfying\nto relate to than the nines and tens\nthey are still plenty attractive but\nthey frankly just have more to offer\nthan their looks to find an ugly ducking\nyou need to pay attention to her stories\nmaybe she never had a boyfriend in high\nschool or she was reserved in college\nthis could mean that she was devoting\ntime and energy to developing herself or\nsome other character building exercise\nlike starting a business or caring for a\nloved one it also likely means that she\ndoesn't take male attention for granted"
