    "transcript": "the idea that you just want to be nice\nto somebody is kind of bull let's keep\nit a buck and there's a very simple way\nto demonstrate this if you really just\nwant the other person to smile or to\nhave a nice day or to have an easier\nlife or whatever then would you offer\nthe same gifts and support anonymously\nthat's the real test would you be okay\nwith the other person not knowing the\ngood came from you or even thinking the\ngood things came from somebody else if\nyou just want to make their lives better\nwhy would it matter be real honest with\nyourself the vast majority of people are\nseeking after some form of positive\nregard and consideration that comes as a\nresult of being the acknowledged Giver\nof those resources and benefits and\nthere's nothing necessarily wrong with\nthat it doesn't make you a bad person if\nyou want to be recognized for the good\nthat you do but it does make you a\nlittle\nself-deceptive if you won't admit that\neven to yourself"
