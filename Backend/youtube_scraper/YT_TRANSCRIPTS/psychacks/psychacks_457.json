    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is I don't\nplay\ngames so this is a statement that I've\nheard many many times over the course of\nmy dating history and it's my\nunderstanding that it almost always\ncomes from the woman because it almost\nalways precedes some kind of request it\nusually goes like this hey I know what I\nwant and I don't play games I'm looking\nfor committed relationship ship if you\nare not prepared to give me what I want\nthen please do not waste my time I've\ngot no time for games sound\nfamiliar now I can appreciate where this\nis coming from the women who do this\ngenerally believe that by doing so they\nare dating intentionally and just for\nthe record there is no problem with\ndating intentionally it's a good\nstrategy for a lot of women the problem\nis going about dating intentionally so\nstupidly and inelegantly that it's\nfunctionally impossible to generate the\ndesired result women telling a man that\nyou want a relationship and you don't\nwant to play games works just as well as\na man telling you that he just wants to\n you casually and he doesn't want to\nplay games like those two statements are\ngendered equivalents of each other\nthough to be fair the man's desire is\nmuch less expensive to satisfy than the\nwoman's is men learned from a very young\nage that that doesn't work which is why\nmen lie to you enough of you didn't give\nthem what they wanted when they told you\nthe truth by the same token men\nespecially men that you have no\nemotional buyin with are not just going\nto give you what you want if you ask for\nit like that and this is not only\nbecause you're asking for something\nextremely valuable we're not inclined to\ngive this to you you because on some\nlevel we know that I don't play games is\n to demonstrate why this is\n allow me to tell you how I\nwould normally handle this situation\nwhen a woman would tell me hey I'm\nlooking for a serious relationship and I\ndon't want to play games my general\nresponse was something like thank God I\nam so glad you said that personally I am\ndone with dating I am ready to go to the\ncourthouse tonight for the right woman\nso tell me what's your\noffer and without fail this question\nwould always be met with complete and\nutter\nincomprehension what do you mean what's\nmy\noffer and I would\nexplain Oh I thought you just wanted to\nget down to it I get that you want a\nserious relationship you were very\nexplicit message received so what I want\nto know is what do I get in\nreturn like what would I specifically\nget for giving you what you specifically\nwant and I have to say I find it really\nhot that you're willing to dispense with\nall the foreplay and pretense and just\ntell me what I have to gain from this\ntransaction like I am tired of the games\ntoo\nso and I'm sure you can all guess how\nwell that went over not once not once\nhave I ever received answer to that\nquestion not a single woman told me well\nI cook I clean I'm rich and I'm willing\nto share I'm super sexual I'm kind and\nsupportive I'm a great conversationalist\nI'm laidback and open to unconventional\nrelationships I'll raise your children I\nhave 20 goats and 16 heads of cattle\nnothing nada I have never received an\nhonest straightforward answer to an\nhonest straightforward question the only\nresponse I've ever received is angry\nindignation how rude is that what you\nthink of women good luck to you buddy\nand of course there is no great loss to\nme when that happens now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message it's your\ndonations that make all of this happen I\ndon't do corporate sponsorships or\nproduct placements so this helps to keep\nthe lights on I really appreciate it\nwomen what you have to understand is\nthat dating is sort of like buying a car\nwhen you walk into a dealership and you\nsay hey I want to buy a car what is the\nvery next thing the salesman is going to\nsay I bet you a nickel the very next\nthing that that salesman is going to say\nis great what's your budget and that's\nbecause what's your budget is the polite\nway of asking how much are you willing\nto give me and he wants to know that as\nsoon as possible because the answer to\nthat question is going to significantly\ninfluence what's on offer you're not\ngoing to be showing the Lamborghini if\nyou have a Honda budget and becoming\nindignant at the salesman because he's\nwondering what he's going to get out of\nthe transaction certainly isn't going to\nhelp you drive off in a car but you know\nwhat will help you though showing up\nwith\nmoney you show up with enough money\nmoney and you can buy a car in 30\nseconds no games necessary hello I want\nthis car can you pay the listed\nprice yes please sign here boom you now\nhave a car if you're clear and explicit\nabout the value proposition there is no\nneed to play games however if you are\nnot clear and explicit about the value\nproposition or if you can't afford the\nlisted price the only way you can get\nwhat you want is by playing games so\nladies if you're going to take the brass\ntax approach to dating I would recommend\ngiving some very serious thought to how\nyou would answer my question what would\nthe guy get in return and then ask\nyourself if that's a fair trade if not I\nwould encourage you to go back to\nplaying games you'll probably have more\nluck that way the fact of the matter is\nthat anyone who says that they don't\nplay games is lying to you I don't play\ngames doesn't mean I don't play games it\nmeans hurry up and give me what I want\nsee for yourself anyone who actually\ndoesn't play games would be thrilled to\ndemonstrate the value they could provide\nthey'd be proud to tell you the guy who\nwalks into a dealership with a suitcase\nfull of cash is proud to be carrying a\nsuitcase full of cash a person who says\nI don't play games is hoping that\nsomehow you'd be foolish enough to\nbelieve that at face value and not play\ngames with them it's a strategy designed\nto divest you of your strategies which\nis part of the game however in the\nabsence of game there is only explicit\nnegotiation and let me tell you explicit\nnegotiation isn't free of games either\nit's just a different kind of game\npeople don't get what they deserve they\nget what they negotiate right so even\nnegotiation has game playing and in the\nabsence of explicit negotiation it's\nnothing but game playing this is going\nto sound\ndepressing but the only way people\nreally get what they want in romantic\nrelationships is by playing games I mean\nthey literally call Men's ability to get\nsex from women\ngame and as I discussed in a recent\nepisode women need game too and they\nneed game to get a committed\nrelationship if you were to strip away\nall of the games all that would remain\nwould be the negotiation of an explicit\nvalue proposition which is precisely\nwhat happens in arranged marriages it\nwould feel like a business deal which is\nprobably not inaccurate most people\nespecially most women don't want their\nrelationships to feel that way they want\nthem to feel organic and emotional and\nnon-transactional people want to feel\nlike their partners are giving them what\nthey want because they want to do it not\nbecause of what they're getting in\nreturn right I want you to want me\nright so make the proposition too\nexplicit and it not only breaks the\nmagic spell it might also highlight a\npretty large value discrepancy between\nthe two parties again I don't play games\nis a lie and you should be very cautious\nabout moving forward with anybody who\nhas the audacity to claim that they\ndon't what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like the priority\nreview
