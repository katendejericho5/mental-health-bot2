    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is passport\nBros and international dating so this is\na topic that has come up frequently in\nthe comments of several of my videos and\nit's a topic that I've been requested to\ndiscuss by many people over the last\nseveral months if you're unfamiliar with\nthe subject passport Bros is the\ncollective term for a movement among\nWestern and specifically American men\nwho are incre in inly pursuing mating\nand dating opportunities abroad these\nare guys who are flying to places like\nSouth America and Southeast Asia and the\nMiddle East in order to access sexual\nopportunities that they argue aren't\navailable in their home country and I'm\ngoing to respond to this phenomenon\nthrough the lens of my recent\nexperiences spending a month in the\ncountry of\nJapan now I'm not very knowledgeable\nabout this phenomenon but to be honest\nthere was always something about the\npassport Bros movement that felt a\nlittle Sleazy and pathetic Without\nReally examining it my perspective was\nsimilar to the prevailing attitude which\nwas something like this movement was for\nguys who were too low status or\nunattractive to beat out their intr\nseexual competition here they couldn't\nget late in the states so they basically\nengage in geoarbitrage to leverage a\nrelative advantage that wouldn't exist\nin their home country my attitude was\nsomething like like only guys who\ncouldn't get what they want from women\nhere would need to uproot their whole\nlives and travel Halfway Around the\nWorld which kind of made these men out\nto be conniving beta males that was my\nattitude before spending a month in\nJapan that is no longer my attitude now\nhaving spent a month in that country I\nthink I better understand where this\nmovement might be coming from and I\ndefinitely don't think it's just for\nloser men who can't get laid in America\nallow me to explain from the perspective\nof my interests and preferences the\nquality of the women in Japan was\nsignificantly superior to the quality of\nthe women in the Bay Area like not by a\nlittle by orders of magnitude let me\nbreak down some of the various factors\nthat go into that statement first of all\nthe women in Japan are slender and\nphysically healthy\nI spent a month in some of the largest\ncities in the world and I must have seen\n10 overweight women in that entire time\nhalf of whom were little old ladies and\nthese overweight women weren't morbidly\nobese they were like plump maybe 20 or\n30 pounds overweight Max most western\nwomen literally couldn't buy clothes in\nJapan the vast majority of Japanese\nwomen are slender and physically fit\nwhich is appealing because it's not only\nattractive but it indicates a compatible\nvalue as well like I want people who\ncare about their health second these\nwomen are feminine they wear dresses and\nheels and makeup they tend to dress more\nconservatively than Western women no\ntight clothes no showing a lot of skin\nthe feminine ideal there seems to be\nlike softly elegant flowing and modest\nand dignified and these aren't 1950s\nHousewives these are women who for the\nmost part are working professionals they\nhave modern ideas they are educated and\naccomplished but they haven't thrown out\nmore traditional conceptualizations of\nfemale Beauty this is not something you\ncan easily find in the west anymore and\nyou can't find it at all in the Bay Area\nat all and I find feminine women very\nattractive it resonates with me and\ninspires me to be even more masculine\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to

and trust me I get like 50\ndifferent offers a day this helps me\nstay independent and it helps me to do\nwhat I need to do to keep the channel\ngoing so thank you very much for your\nsupport all right third the women in\nJapan are extremely\nrespectful every woman I interacted with\nthere was extremely warm and friendly\nthey were receptive to conversation and\nthey seemed to enjoy or at least very\neffectively pretended to enjoy speaking\nwith me even more they were solicitous\nabout my feelings and seemed concerned\nthat I should enjoy the interaction as\nwell I didn't experience a single IND\nor disrespectful word tone or glance\nfrom a woman in a month this made\napproaching and talking to women in\nJapan a much less fraught experience\nthan it is in the US the women I spoke\nto seem to take pleasure in the\nattention and in the dialogue nothing\nabout the interaction indicated they\nwere annoyed or offended that I was\ninterested in talking to them fourth\nwhile a kind of chivalry exists in Japan\nit's an inverted version of what we have\nhere in Japan men come first women come\nsecond it's difficult to appreciate how\ndeeply the Romantic ideology permeates\nour manners until you go to a completely\ndifferent culture for instance one day I\nwas walking towards the main entrance of\na building at pretty much the same time\nas a woman my natural instinct was to\nget there first and hold the door open\nfor her however when I did so she\nrefused to walk through it making a show\nof great embarrassment and I later\nrealized that in that culture it would\nhave been embarrassing for her if I had\nallowed myself to disrespect myself in\nthat way for her sake another example\nmany years ago I spent some weeks in\nJapan studying BAU dance in an immersive\nprogram the first night of the program\nat the general assembly we heard a long\nspeech on how the organizers\nmiscalculated the number of futons they\nneeded for the students apparently there\nwould not be enough beds for everyone so\nthe women would have to sleep on the\nbare floor without cushions or sheets\nuntil the problem was rectified now\nthere were a couple other westerners in\nthe audience and I remember we were just\nlooking at each other in disbelief to\nsay we were shocked would not be an\nunderstatement the idea that the women\nwere going to sleep on the ground while\nthe men were going to sleep in the beds\nfelt completely unnatural to us however\nour way of doing things is just as\nunnatural to Japanese\nsensibilities that's starting to change\nmore and more as Western ideologies\ncontinue to infiltrate Japanese Society\nbut the important thing here is to\nunderstand that a lot of what many\npeople believe to be the natural dynamic\nbetween men and women is really very\nculturally bounded and culturally\nspecific and to be honest it felt good\nto be honored for being a man like it's\nnot a bad thing to be a man in Japan in\nfact it seems to come with some\nprivileges that are more commensurate to\nthe responsibilities that men generally\ntake on so let's recap on the whole\nJapanese women are slender and\nphysically fit feminine and demure\nfriendly and courteous and respectful\nand appreciative not all Japanese women\nI'm sure but the vast majority of them\nas far as I could tell when I spoke with\nthem the feeling I got was that they\nfelt lucky to be interacting with me\nwhich is a total reversal of the\nattitude you generally encounter in the\nwest I've gone on a lot of dates in my\nday and the prevailing Vibes were either\na that I should feel lucky that the\nwoman was allowing me to buy her a drink\nor B that the woman needed to make sure\nI could give her what she wanted by\nconducting the date like a job interview\nthere's a lot of entitlement and\nnarcissism here it's all about her on\nthe other hand my sense is that in Japan\nwomen feel grateful for the opportunity\nto be there grateful for the opportunity\nto be considered as a potential partner\nit was extremely refreshing to say the\nleast now I'm not a fragile guy I'm not\na loser who who can't get laid I'm not\npoor or low status or\nunattractive I'm not a guy without\noptions I don't need to travel halfway\naround the world to have satisfying\nrelationships with women but I now\nunderstand why it's in men's best\ninterest to seek out the most\nadvantageous marketplaces it's like\nregardless of whether you're a novice or\na master fisherman if you want to catch\na certain kind of fish it makes sense to\ngo where there are more of those\nfishes high value men who have lots of\nsexual opportunity in the west will\nstill travel to other places where they\ncan get more of what they want more\neasily that's not pathetic that's\nrational and efficient even millionaires\ndon't like paying more than they need to\neven though they could afford to do so\nand Western women are extremely\nexpensive men here generally have to pay\nmore for Less relative to other\nmarketplaces so I'm much more\nsympathetic to this movement after\nspending a month abroad what do you\nthink does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nconsider becoming a channel member with\nperks like the
