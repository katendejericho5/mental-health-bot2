    "transcript": "one of the things that I tell my clients\nis that other guys make me look good I\nhave nothing to fear from other guys\nbecause I've seen the competition and if\nyou can't yet authentically endorse that\nbelief yourself then you've got some\nwork to do your work is to level up your\nlife by investing in yourself to the\npoint that you can legitimately be\nperceived as the best option by the\ncaliber of women to whom you are\nattracted and this really shouldn't be\nthat tough of a cell as most of this\nwork directly benefits you anyway and\nonce you succeed in doing so you'll have\nother work to do because the work never\nstops however let's just take this one\nstep at a time also if you're a woman's\nperceived best option then most of the\ntricks of control and manipulation that\nguys are subject to using to secure love\naffection and sex become increasingly\nirrelevant you don't need them you don't\nneed to try to control your partner or\nconvince her that she should be there or\nmess with her emotions"
