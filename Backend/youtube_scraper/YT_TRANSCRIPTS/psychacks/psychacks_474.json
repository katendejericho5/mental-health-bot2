    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the best\nthat life has to offer so I recently got\nback from spending a month in Japan and\nI was inspired by my time there to share\nwith you one of my favorite poems don't\nworry it's very short in fact it's only\nthree lines long it's a translated Haiku\nand it goes like this oh snail climb\nFuji but slowly\nslowly I love this poem because there is\nso much wisdom contained in those three\nlines and I think a lot of this wisdom\nultimately pertains to the best that\nlife has to offer now if you don't see\nthat yet allow me to explain three very\nimportant teachings contained within\nthis poem the payoff is the third\nteaching so be sure you listen all the\nway to the end first of all\nit's important in life to\ndream big when it comes to most people\ntheir problem is not that they're\narrogantly overestimating what they're\ncapable of accomplishing it's true that\nthere are some people out there who have\nan inflated sense of self-worth and\ncompetence but even when it comes to\nsuch people the ends to which they hope\nto apply that inflated sense of\nself-worth are so petty and pathetic\nthat they are unlikely to produce a\ngreat deal of fulfillment to say nothing\nof happiness for themselves or others\nthough as I talk about in my episode why\nI talk about sex and money they may have\nto attain those things first in order to\nfacilitate Their Own\ndisillusionment no what I love about\nthis poem is that we're addressing a\nsnail oh snail right now the idea of a\nsnail climbing Mount Fuji is ludicrous\non the surface Mount Fuji so big little\nsnail so small right but that's better\nthan the alternative it's better for a\nsnail to aim at climbing Mount Fuji than\nit is for a snail to content itself with\nimmediately achievable goals it's\nimportant in life to dream big because\nspoiler alert that's actually what life\nis for life is for the attainment of our\ndreams so why not climb Mount Fuji live\nand epic life okay now the second piece\nof wisdom pertains to how the snail is\ngoing to go about his task oh snail\nclimb Mount Fuji but\nslowly of course the snail is g to climb\nMount Fuji slowly it's a snail so the\nsecond piece of wisdom contained in this\npoem is that you have to do things in\nthe way that you can do them the poem\ndoesn't say oh snail soar to the top of\nMount Fuji or swim to the top of Mount\nFuji or leap to the top of Mount Fuji it\nsays to climb slowly because of whom\nit's addressing a snail so the first two\nthings are kind of in jux opposition to\neach other the idea is to dream big to\nAspire beyond your capacities but to\nachieve that dream within your\ncapacities both things are actually\npossible the goal is beyond you but the\nmeans are within you\nokay the poem is an acknowledging that\nthe only way for a snail to climb Mount\nFuji is slowly by analogy the only way\nthat you can achieve your dreams is in a\nmanner amenable to your nature you can\nonly achieve your dreams in the way that\nyou can achieve them you're not going to\ndo it the way that I'm going to do it or\nyour parents did it or your girlfriend\nwants you to do it or your Society tells\nyou you should do it okay you're going\nto do it in the way that you can do it\ndo you understand the idea here is to\nbecome very very clear with respect to\nyour nature your preferences your\nabilities your capacities what really\nworks for you what you really want and\nto align your means with that nature\nbecause this is going to greatly\nincrease the likelihood that you succeed\nthat you actually get somewhere now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow you may also consider hitting the\nthanks button and tipping me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this episode your donations\nhelp make all this possible I don't do\nproduct placements or corporate\nsponsorships even though I get offers\nevery day to do that this keeps me\nindependent and allows me to continue to\nPride high value content to you the\nlistener so I really appreciate it thank\nyou\nnow the third piece of wisdom is\nactually the most important and it has\nto do with the final word of the poem Oh\nsnail climb Mount Fuji but\nslowly\nslowly now the first slowly has to do\nwith the fact that we're addressing a\nsnail like of course it's going to climb\nslowly but the second slowly seems kind\nof redundant doesn't it poetically the\nrepetition is an intensifier in the\nsense that slowly slowly me something\nlike very slowly but I think it's unfair\nto the poem If we stop our\ninterpretation there now what you have\nto understand here is that the poem like\nmany Haiku is actually an allegory in a\nliteral sense Mount Fuji is the highest\npoint in Japan but in an allegorical\nsense it represents the highest goal to\nwhich a little snail which dwarfed by\nthe immensity of nature represents you\nor me could possibly\nAspire that's what the poem is exhorting\nus to do to aim for the highest goal we\ncan possibly\nconceive and to achieve that goal in a\nmeans aligned with our true\nnatures and if we do all that then\nreally what's the point in hurrying\nthink about it there's no higher point\nin all of Japan so so if you actually\nget to the top of Mount Fuji then all\nthat's left for you to do is to come\ndown there is no higher goal so the idea\nhere is to orient ourselves toward the\nhighest goal we could possibly conceive\nand to spend as long as possible in the\nattainment of that goal and with this in\nmind the best possible goal is an\ninfinite goal one that can't ever really\nbe attained but that gives us the\npretext to eternally climb towards it\nbecause this my friends is where\nhappiness and fulfillment lie not in the\ngaining not in the achieving but in the\nclimbing if you ever actually achieve a\ngoal then either the whole journey ends\nor you have to suffer the decline that\ninevitably follows remember the worst\npart of a road trip is a\nso the idea is not only to climb Mount\nFuji slowly because us little snails how\nelse are we really going to do it but to\ndo so slowly\nslowly if we're doing it right it's\ngonna take us a\nlong time to get where we're going but\nit's really the only show in town so why\nare you in the hurry to get to the\ncredits and this process of moving in\nthe direction of our highest conceivable\ngoal just might be the best that life\nhas to offer there is by definition\nnothing higher such that if we actually\nattain this goal it's either the end of\nall life or the beginning of a decline\nso the best that life has to offer is\nsomething like endlessly striving toward\nan infinitely receding goal of the\nhighest virtue and\nmagnitude not bad for a three-line poem\nhuh we are happiest when we're climbing\nso if you're in a rut if you're not\nfeeling very good then maybe you either\nneed to start gaining some elevation or\nto seek out a higher mountain to climb\nlook around you what's the highest\nmountain you can see that's your goal\nand once you found your goal you'll\ndiscover who you are as you climb it and\nthis knowledge will inform how you climb\nit's reciprocal there's no hurry because\nthere might not be anything better life\nhas to offer once you're done what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you
