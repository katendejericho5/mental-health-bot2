    "transcript": "no matter how well you vet a woman no\nmatter how much due diligence you\nperform you will ultimately be rolling\nthe dice with respect to that particular\nrelationship there's no way around it so\nwhat you have to understand is that all\nrelationships with women are a form of\ngambling you can learn the rules and do\nyour research but you still have to roll\nthe dice and this means that on some\nlevel you should approach women like you\napproach gambling and the first\nunbreakable rule of gambling is that you\nnever ever ever under any circumstances\never gamble with more than you can\nafford to lose this is the fundamental\nrule of gambling all professional\ngamblers have their Kitty the money they\nplay with and they have the money they\nneed to live and support their\nLifestyles the two must remain separate\nand distinct when a gambler starts to\nplay with the money he needs to live is\nprecisely the moment he crosses over\ninto a gambling addiction"
