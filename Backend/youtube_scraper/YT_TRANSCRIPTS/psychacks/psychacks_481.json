    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nget any man you want the master key this\none is for the ladies and it's a long\none so be sure to watch until the very\nend over the last several months many of\nyou have requested that I make some\nepisodes from the perspective of women\nwho are finding it difficult to enter\ninto the relationships they would like\nto have with the men that they want to\nhave them with and if you're one of them\nthen it's your lucky day not only am I\ngoing to make an episode on the subject\nI'm going to make three episodes on the\nsubject this one being the first however\nsome caveats before we begin first if\nyou're a woman who is not looking to get\nher needs met in a relationship with a\nman then these episodes aren't for you\nyou're not going to find much of\nInterest here and you might as well just\nclick away now second these episodes\naren't about securing a relationship\nwith just any guy that's actually fairly\neasy these episodes are about securing a\nrelationship with the high value men you\nreally want to have relationships with\nthese strategies will work on alpha\nmales and Millionaires and professional\nathletes or anyone else you happen to be\ntargeting and third these suggestions\nare not moral exhortations okay I'm not\nsuggesting that women have a moral or\nethical responsibility to act in certain\nways in their relationships what I am\nsaying is that if women act in certain\nways in their relationships they will\nsignificantly increase their chances of\nsecuring a commitment from any given man\nthis isn't about what women should do in\na moral sense it's about what works in a\npractical sense all good then let's get\nto it now right off the bat I have some\ngood news and some bad news for you\nwomen the good news is really good the\ngood news is you can get any man you\nwant I'm not kidding any man the only\nstipulation as we'll see is you you need\nto have direct access to him which means\nyou need to be able to contact him and\nyou need to be able to meet with him\nthat's it but that means that these\nstrategies aren't going to work on say a\ncelebrity or a stranger and these\nstrategies will work to get any man you\nhave access to even if you're not super\nhot yes if you are physically gorgeous\nit's going to make things a whole lot\neasier however you have no control over\nthat and the truth of the matter is that\nmany of these women are nightmares to\nhave relationships with being very\nattractive is a real Advantage for women\nbut it's not the whole story and of of\ncourse you should do all that you can to\npresent yourself in as the most\nattractive version of yourself possible\nlike don't neglect this just because you\ncan't be a supermodel so that's the good\nnews you can get any man you\nwant great the bad news is that if you\nhaven't yet been able to do this it's\nyour\nfault you are the problem I'm not\nkidding since most men will entertain\nsexual offers from most women if you're\nhaving trouble converting a man into a\nrelationship it's your fault the flip\nside of this is that it's the man's\nfault if he can't attract female\ninterest like wouldn't you agree it's\nthe man's responsibility to develop\nhimself to the point where he becomes an\nattractive option to women right it's\nnot your fault if you're not attracted\nto him we're not going to blame women\nfor not wanting to sleep with\nunattractive men and women certainly\naren't going around sleeping with men\nout of pity or sympathy or moral\nobligation right attraction is his\nproblem but if you can't get a man to\ncommit to you that's your problem and\nit's your fault it's your responsibility\nto do the things you need to do in order\nto get a guy to commit to you and it\nworks like this because women are the\nGateKeeper of sex which is why men need\nto work at becoming viable sexual\noptions for women and because men are\nThe Gatekeepers of commitment which is\nwhy women need to work at becoming\nviable commitment options for men you\ndon't get commitment just because you\nwant it or simply as a function of\ntime which is why telling men that\nyou're looking for a serious\nrelationship right out of the gate is\nwild wild and wildly ineffective you\nalso can't like just stick around long\nenough I'm sure that there are men in\nyour life who have wanted to you\nfor years but they wanting it or they\nwanting it long enough wasn't sufficient\nfor you to give them what they wanted\nwas it so simply putting in the time is\nnot a reliable strategy in fact it\ncarries a number of risks most of which\nare disproportionately born by you the\nwoman so if it's your fault then what's\nthe main thing tripping you up what is\nthe biggest way in which women are their\nown worst enemies in a\nword\npride in most cases pride is what is\nstanding between you and the\nrelationship you want with the man you\nwant to have it with and let me tell you\nas someone who has suffered from pride\npride himself pride is cold company\nit does not keep you warm at night so\nwhat I want you to consider is that\nthere is a time and a place to\nprioritize pride and there is a time and\na place to prioritize Effectiveness or\nHarmony and it's going to be really hard\nfor you to have a loving harmonious\nrelationship if you consistently\nprioritize your own Pride over these\nother interpersonal goals you may need\nto choose do I want to hold on to my\npride or do I want to hold on to my\nrelationship you may not be able to have\nboth I I told you I you can get any man\nyou want but you can't get any man you\nwant in any way that you want to get him\nthere are ways that you have to behave\nin order to do that and letting go of\nthat Pride might be one of them now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really helped to make the channel\ngrow you may also consider hitting the\nthanks button and tipping me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this episode I don't do\ncorporate sponsorships or product\nplacements though I get asked to do them\nall the time so this helps me stay\nindependent and it helps keep the light\non I really appreciate it thank\nyou okay so if you can get any man that\nyou have access to then what exactly do\nyou have to do well you need to do three\nthings hence three episodes the first\ntwo are things you have to do the third\nthing is something that you have to not\ndo and the rest of this episode will be\nconcerned with the first thing which I\ncall the master key as it's the single\nmost important factor in unlocking the\nrelationship you want all women will\nbenefit from this however it is\nabsolutely essential for women who\naren't very attractive like if your\nnormalized sexual Marketplace value is\nbelow an eight which doesn't mean that\nyou're more attractive than 80% of your\nintersexual competition because nsmv is\ncurve linear not scalar so fewer than\n20% of all women are eights or above if\nyour nsmv is below an eight then this\nthing is non-negotiable you have to do\nit to get a commitment from the guy you\nwant you either have to do this or you\nhave to be extremely manipulative so\npick your poison and if you don't do\nthis one thing then the man will\nyou but he won't commit to you are you\nready the master key the one thing that\nyou absolutely have to do as a woman in\norder to secure a commitment from a man\nis you have to be\nuseful useful that is the key you have\nto be useful I'll say it as many times\nas I need to you have to be useful and\nthis is actually a reversal of the way\nthat most women go about dating and\nrelationships in which it's all about\nthem relative to the man you want you\nare not the\nprize you are only the prize relative to\nthe men who want you and you don't want\nthose guys and this means that you can't\nexpect to be the adored in this Dynamic\nif you assume that this guy is going to\ngo out of his way and come to you and\npick you up and buy you dinner and work\non your schedule and cater to your\ndesires you have another thing coming\nit's not about you a busy successful man\nwith lots of options doesn't have time\nfor that nonsense he's on a mission and\nhis mission which is generally\nassociated with a self-transcendent\noverarching goal is more important than\nwhat you want but here's the catch you\ncan get what you want if you can help\nthe man achieve his mission that is if\nyou can be\nuseful ask not what your man can do for\nyou but what you can do for your man\nokay that is essential because if you\ncan be useful to a man you can slowly\nintegrate yourself step by step into his\nlife to the point where you are so\ninvolved in the everyday mechanics of\nhis existence that it would be\nfunctionally impossible to get rid of\nyou a man will never get rid of a useful\nwoman he might not commit to you that\ntakes still other things we'll talk\nabout that in future episodes but he\nwill never get rid of you in the absence\nof a marriage contract which you don't\nhave yet usefulness is your safety net\nwhy because if your usefulness would\nsignificantly disrupt his life if you\nwere to leave you now have job security\nif the only thing you take with you when\nyou leave a relationship is your Netflix\npassword you up you were not\nproviding valuable instrumental support\nwhich made it easy to replace you and or\nlet you\ngo and how do you help a man you help a\nman by making his life\neasier yeah I'm sorry you help a man by\nmaking his life better\nand his work easier most women do\nneither of these things y'all can be a\nreal headache to deal with you're like a\nsecond job that we have to pay to work\nand relationships like this not only\ngenerally don't last but are\ncharacterized by conflict and strife\nuntil they fall apart as well however if\nyou can approach relationships with a\ndifferent mentality with the\nunderstanding that you are earning the\nprivilege of a relationship with the man\nyou desire by Prov providing value\nyou're going to have a much easier time\nof things it's just like in business\njust asking for a job or a professional\ncommitment doesn't work you earn your\nopportunities with your competence and\nyour effort and your savviness the same\nis true here now how you can actually be\nhelpful depends on the man in question\nI'm not talking about token gestures of\naffection buying flowers or baking\ncookies or sending text\nthose things are nice but they're\ngenerally what women like and none of\nthem are really going to make a man's\nlife much easier you can learn how to\nhelp a man by becoming curious about his\nlife do your\nresearch ask questions listen to him\nthis isn't some schmuck who's sitting on\nthe couch getting high and playing video\ngames there is a reason why you're\nattracted to him and that reason\nprobably has to do with the fact that he\nhas a lot going on the the number one\nthing I hear from women that they want\nthat they're that they want in a man is\nambition they have a lot of things going\non ambitious men between his career and\nhis mission and his lifestyle his hands\nare full it takes time and effort and\nenergy to execute those things you're\nnot just here to benefit from all of his\nhard work that's narcissistic and\nentitled remember the only women who get\nthis treatment are trophy wives and to\nbe a trophy wife you need to a be\nenviably\nbeautiful and B stay on the shelf where\nyou\nbelong most of you are not a and most of\nyou don't want B so you need to\ncultivate other expectations with\nrespect to how you approach\nmen get curious about the guy's life\nfigure out what he's about and how he's\nabout doing it what would help him him\nalong his way what would make his life\neasier what could you possibly take off\nhis plate then start offering assistance\nbased on the information you've gleaned\nfrom your research why because if you\nhelp a man achieve his goals you're\ngoing to be standing next to him when he\ngets there that is what smart women\nunderstand the ticket to being next to a\nsuccessful guy is getting involved in\nhis success not just enjoying the\nbenefits of his success provide\ninstrumental support this could look\nlike making meals doing housework\nmanaging Logistics researching options\nrunning errands managing aspects of the\nbusiness taking care of things\nproactively before they become problems\netc etc etc it's like a woman who is\ndoing that for me how could I get rid of\nthat woman she would be invaluable to me\nand it would be relatively easy easy to\nslide into that role because there's not\na lot of\ncompetition there are tons of women who\nare competing for my attention and my\ntime and my money Etc but there's not a\nlot of women competing to help me most\nmen get zero\nhelp this is your opportunity it's a way\nto bypass\n99% of your competition in the sexual\nMarket place I'm not kidding ladies this\nis how you get in what you have to\nunderstand is that service is a gift for\nyou it's a gift because it's the pathway\ninto that man's life and it's a gift to\nyou because in general the value you\nprovide is still less than the value you\nreceive helping the guy out grants you\naccess to increasingly more intimate\naspects of his life and it can be very\nVal to be in some people's inner circles\nyou have to earn your place in men's\nlives much like men have to earn their\nsexual opportunities I mean you're not\njust giving out sex to anybody who wants\nit right the guy has got to do things\nfor you and do things to you the same is\ntrue for you you can't just sit there\nand expect the guy to hand over the keys\nto the kingdom and in this market sex is\nmuch much cheaper than commitment\nyou gain access to that commitment by\nbeing useful and providing value and\nthat usefulness is determined by the\nspecific man's needs and the specific\nman's Mission and what's going to stop\nyou from doing\nthat Pride that indignant voice that\nlies to you and tells you I shouldn't\nhave to do that or that's beneath me or\nthis isn't the 1950s or what about me\nthat voice is what is standing in your\nway listen to me your best bet at\ngetting your needs met from a high value\nman is serving his after all that man is\nnot going to enter into your frame\nyou're not going to take care of him\nyou're G to enter into his and he's\ngoing to take care of you and your\nticket into that frame is by offering to\nmake its operation smoother and\neasier that responsibility is a\nprivilege because it's an invitation\ninto that man's inner sanctum and the\nmore you become implicated in the actual\nmechanics of his life the harder it will\nbe to ever remove you from that\nsituation again women don't have to do\nthese things but trust me these things\nwork hopefully that makes sense what do\nyou think let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode
