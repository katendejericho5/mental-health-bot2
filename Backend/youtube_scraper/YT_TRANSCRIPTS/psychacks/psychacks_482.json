    "transcript": "committed relationships generally don't\nhappen if men are just left to their own\ndevices most men are totally fine\nkeeping things casual indefinitely this\nis because as I talked about in my\nepisode men treat women the way women\ntreat money we already had to work\nreally hard just to get sexually\nselected so we want to enjoy our time\nnot take on a second job most men don't\nhave relationship goals like women do\nthat's because the goal of most men is\nto get laid this is because the vast\nmajority of men are incredibly hungry\nfor sex and they would be absolutely\nravenous if they weren't anesthetizing\nthemselves with pornography when people\nare starving all they think about is\nfood they're not really interested in\nwhat happens after dinner now women you\nmight be disgusted by this you might\nthink oh I just want sex go somewhere\nelse but it's like that's actually men\nare so easy to get into relationships\nwith because of that that's where\nthey're so vulnerable that's what I'd\nlike you to consider is that this is an\nopportunity for you it's not something\nthat like should be considered beneath\nyou"
