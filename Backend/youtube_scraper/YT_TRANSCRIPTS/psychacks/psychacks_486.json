    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women\nneed game too this one is for the ladies\nwomen it turns out you also need game\ngame is not just for the boys however\nmen and women need game for different\nreasons let me help you understand this\nlet's say you're about to go on a first\ndate with a guy you matched with on a\ndating app you're probably not thinking\nto S I hope he'll let me Smash like I\nhope the date goes so well that he'll\ntake me back to his place and do\nwhatever he wants with me there might be\nsome women out there that think that and\nfeel free to get in touch with me if\nthat's you but they're decidedly in the\nminority my understanding is that women\ngenerally dislike dating if they're\nthinking anything before the date it's\nprobably something like please God\nplease Jesus alab Buddha please make him\nbetter than the last guy please make\nthis the last first date I ever have to\ngo on please hear my prayer and that's\nbecause women generally want\nrelationships and if they could skip\nright to that part they would however\nthey can't so dating is something of a\nnecessary evil for them this is also why\nthey're generally not very good at it\nbut that's the subject for another\nepisode in any case that's my\nunderstanding of how women tend to\napproach first dat however it's also\ntrue that most women have had sex with a\nguy on the first date how did that\nhappen that wasn't the woman's primary\nintention going into the date right did\nshe just stumble into bed no it happened\nbecause that was the guy's primary\nintention and because he had game that\nis the guy was able to sufficiently\nstimulate that woman's interest and\nattraction and confidently lead the\ninteraction in the direction of a sexual\nencounter after all women are The\nGatekeepers of sex so sex happened\nbecause the guy was able to find a way\ninside nice work guy the point is that\nmost women don't go into that situation\nhoping for or expecting that outcome and\nyet that outcome happens every day\nthat's game now let's take a look at it\nfrom the other side shall we as a guy I\ncan tell you that when we're about to go\non a first date with a woman that we\nmatched with on a dating app we are not\nthinking I hope she's the one I hope\nthis is the love of my life and my\nfuture wife and the mother of my\nchildren I hope she's willing to take it\nslow and that she's ready for a serious\nrelationship because that's sure what I\nwant now there might be some men out\nthere who think that way but they are\ndecidedly in the minority most men are\nthinking I hope she looks like her\npictures and she lets me\nSmash that's how men tend to approach\nFirst Dates however it's also true that\nmen end up getting married and starting\nFamilies how did that happened that\nwasn't the guy's primary intention when\nhe started pursuing her did he just\nstumble onto the altar no it happened\nbecause that was the woman's primary\nintention and because she had some game\nthat is the woman sufficiently\nstimulated the man's interest and\nattraction and was able to direct the\ninteraction in the direction of a\ncommitted relationship after all men are\nThe Gatekeepers of commitment so\ncommitment happened because the woman\nwas able to find a way to get inside\nnice work lady the point is that most\nmen don't go into that situation hoping\nfor or expecting that outcome and yet\nthat outcome happens every day that's\ngame now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nmessage it's donations like that that\nreally help to keep the lights on here I\ndon't do corporate sponsorships or\nproduct placements even though I get 50\noffers every day to do that this helps\nme stay independent and allows me to\nproduce this high quality content for\nyou I really appreciate it thank\nyou as a any woman who has dated for a\nwhile has learned committed\nrelationships generally don't happen if\nmen are just left to their own devices\nmost men are totally fine keeping things\ncasual indefinitely this is because as I\ntalked about in my episode men treat\nwomen the way women treat money we\nalready had to work really hard just to\nget sexually selected so we want to\nenjoy our time not take on a second job\nmost men don't have relationship goals\nlike women do that's because the goal of\nmost men is to get laid they don't think\nmuch beyond that this is because the\nvast majority of men are incredibly\nhungry for sex and they would be\nabsolutely ravenous if they weren't\nanesthetizing themselves with\npornography when people are starving all\nthey think about is food they're not\nreally interested in what happens after\ndinner now women you might be disgusted\nby this you might think oh if I just\nwant sex go somewhere else but it's like\nthat's actually men are so e easy to get\ninto relationships with because of that\nthat's where they're so vulnerable\nthat's what I'd like you to consider is\nthat this is an opportunity for you it's\nnot something that like should be\nconsidered beneath you in any case most\nmen don't have a problem with dating\ncasually and if women aren't satisfied\nwith that then like men on a first date\nlooking to have sex with a woman who\nwasn't principally focused on doing so\nwomen need game to guide the situation\nin the direction of a committed\nrelationship and let me tell you most\nwomen are terrible at this they are\nterrible most of them just flat out tell\nthe guy that they're looking for a\ncommitted relationship and it's like\nyeah and what you have to understand\nladies is that that line is like a man\ntelling you that he's looking for casual\nsex\nlike what is that to you right how often\ndo you [ __ ] men who talk to you like\nthat ever right and yet you do [ __ ] men\nand the men you do [ __ ] don't talk to\nyou like that do they the same is true\nfor you men don't just hand out\ncommitted relationships to women because\nthey're looking for them it doesn't work\nthis is because a strange woman asking\nme if I want to have a committed\nrelationship with her sounds about as\nappealing as if she'd asked me if I\nwanted to have unnecessary dental\nsurgery this weekend saying this because\nyou don't want to waste your time ends\nup wasting your time because it works\nabout as well as a guy saying he doesn't\nwant to waste his time on a date if you\ncan't first reassure him that there's a\nstrong likelihood that he'll have sex at\nthe end of it like it's going to take a\nlong time for him to not waste his time\nisn't it ladies if trying to set\nexpectations that sex will be in the\ncards prior to a date doesn't work on\nyou ladies then trying to set\nexpectations that a committed\nrelationship will be in the cards prior\nto it an interaction isn't going to work\non us there's no game here it's so\ninelegant it doesn't work and without\ngame you can't get past the gatekeeper\nif you're a man that means no date and\nno sex and if you're a woman that means\nno date and no committed relationship\nremember wanting is free simply wanting\nwhat you want is not sufficient to\ngetting it like if a man thought that a\nwoman should just give him sex because\nhe wanted it and didn't want to waste\nhis time if a woman wasn't interested\nwouldn't you find that disgusting\nwouldn't you find that narcissistically\nentitled men earn their sexual\nopportunity and they do this by being\nsufficiently attractive and possessing\nenough skill to guide a burgeoning\nconnection in the direction of sexual\nintimacy women do the same thing you\nearn your commitment and you do this by\nbeing sufficiently attractive and\npossessing enough skill to guide a\nconnection in the direction of a\ncommitted\nrelationship that's female game and if\nyou don't have it it will be very hard\nfor you to get that commitment\nespecially in today's day and age where\nthere is significantly less social\npressure to give\nit because let's be real what game women\nhave historically possessed is akin to\ndread game in Men the goal was to make\nmen sufficiently uncomfortable for not\ngiving you what you wanted until they\ngave you what you wanted and the\nprinciple way this was accomplished was\nthrough shame and this worked not all\nthe time but at least it was something\nyou need to man up a real man would\nrespect me and my time and of course the\ntakeaway if you don't give me what I\nwant I'm leaving imagine if a man did\nthis for sex and like was pressuring you\nto do that and to be fair some do and\nthey do it for the same reason that\nwomen do this it works not all the time\nbut some of the time on some of the\npeople the issue here is that women's\ngame where it exists is always negative\nit doesn't make us interested or excited\nto give you what you want when it works\nit works by making us nervous or\nuncomfortable to not give you what you\nwant and listen to this next part very\nclosely ladies this only works on guys\nwho don't have other options and those\nguys aren't typically the ones you're\ntrying this on do you understand women\nyou have to appreciate that most men\nwill have sex with most of you so the\namount of interest that you have to\ngenerate in a man in order for him to be\nwilling to have sex with you is very low\nthat is why among other things it's no\nreal accomplishment for a woman to get\nlaid like we don't call it getting lucky\nwhen a woman has sex right however the\namount of interest that you have to\ngenerate in a man in order for him to be\nwilling to commit to you is\nextraordinarily high and it's high in\nproportion to his\noptionality it's not going to get there\nby itself just like in the majority of\ncases a woman's interest in having sex\nwith any particular guy isn't going to\nget there by itself now you might be\nthinking well that's not true Orion it's\ngotten there by itself with me my\nresponse would be that that's because\nthe guy you were dealing with was so\ngood that you didn't even notice what he\nwas doing and that is the epitome the\nhighest level to which game can attain\nnamely it becomes invisible to the other\nparty and the other person doesn't even\nrealize it's happening same thing when\nwomen have very good\ngame the men think it's their idea to\nadvance the relationship in the\ndirection of her preferred level of\ncommitment this isn't typically that men\nthis isn't something that typically men\ngive you any more than you're just\nhanding sex out to men it's something\nthat you get men to give you expecting\nmen to give you what you want just\nbecause you want it or just because\nenough time has passed is a belief you\nneed to examine ladies the fact of the\nmatter is that you can get any man that\nyou have direct access to I am not\nkidding you can get any man you want and\nI'm going to be doing some episodes on\nthis subject in the near future but to\nget him you have to have game you can't\nget him by doing whatever you want you\ncan get any man you want but you can't\nget them doing anything you want there\nare certain ways that you have to behave\nto do\nthat now let me tell you there are\nmillions of men right now who are out\nthere making it their second job\nstudying what women want just so that\nthey can get laid and in today's market\nfrankly sex isn't even all that valuable\nlike it's not that hard to get so ladies\nif you want something extremely\nexpensive like a committed relationship\nwith a high value man you had better hit\nthe books and learn what works otherwise\nI got no sympathy for you just keeping\nit a buck what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel member or booking a paid\nconsultation as always thank you for\nlistening"
