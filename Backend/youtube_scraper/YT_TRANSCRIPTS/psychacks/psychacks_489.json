    "transcript": "when it comes to heterosexual\nrelationships either the man can be in\nthe woman's frame or the woman could be\nin the man's frame that's it those are\nthe only two options now the most common\nobjection to this formulation goes\nsomething like well Orion why can't they\nbe in each other's frame like why can't\nboth parties leave behind their\nindividual frames and enter into a\nmutually constructed egalitarian frame\nthat serves both people like why isn't\nthat possible huh with respect to most\nof the important decisions that a is\nforced to make compromise is impossible\nfor example if one person wants to live\nin LA and the other person wants to live\nin New York you can't compromise and\nlive in cansas like that doesn't make\nany sense now neither person is getting\nwhat he or she wants so what's the point\nof the relationship again if one person\nwants kids and the other person doesn't\nyou can't compromise by having half a\nchild so if the parties want different\nthings if the relationship is to\ncontinue one person will need to concede\nto the other's frame"
