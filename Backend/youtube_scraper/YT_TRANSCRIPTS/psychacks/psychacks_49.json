    "transcript": "if we're being really honest about what\nthe mind can do it's a really powerful\norganic computer that is calculating all\nof these billions and billions of\nvaluations on a number of different\nlevels beneath the threshold of\nawareness and what it can basically do\nis we're going to put this information\nin to this model with these sort of\nassumptions and it will spit out the\nlikelihood of predicted success\nassociated with various scenarios so\nwhat happens generally is that the brain\ncalculates all of those odds ratios\nbeneath the threshold of awareness and\nthat like probability kind of gets\ntransmuted into an emotion in normal\npeople so a normal person doesn't spend\nhours in the serial aisle they walk down\ntill they see Lucky Charms and they just\nthrow it in their cart because they're\nlike oh Lucky Charms I like this one\nthat liking is the transmuted result of\nall of these billions and billions of\nunconscious calculations that are going\non under the surface but if you take\naway the emotion you just have the\nbillions and billions of calculations\nand information overload which leads to\nanalysis paralysis"
