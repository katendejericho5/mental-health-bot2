    "transcript": "the main reason why guys really struggle\nwith rejecting women besides the\ncultural scripting mentioned earlier is\nscarcity mentality most men do not have\noptions with women and this puts them in\na place where it's really tough for them\nto reject them even when the women are\nobviously not good for them it's like if\nI only had one client it would be pretty\ntough for me to say no to that client\neven if his requests deviated from my\nstandard practice I'd be caught between\nmy values and my livelihood which is a\npretty difficult place to be I might\nneed that client more than that client\nneeds me this is why success and\noptionality can actually make men more\nvirtuous as they are not pulled to\ncompromise their values for any one\nperson or opportunity so a lot of guys\njust can't fathom saying no to a woman\nbecause that woman is like their only\nclient"
