    "transcript": "an emotion that a lot of guys struggle\nwith is guilt this is especially true of\nnice guys who often experience intense\nguilt reactions when they consider\ndisappointing or saying no to a woman my\npoint is that the experiences of these\nmen are valid they really do feel guilty\nregardless of whether they should feel\nthat way but that their emotions might\nnot be justified so when I'm working\nwith someone who's feeling guilty I say\nokay that's how you're feeling that\nfeeling is valid but let's take a look\nat whether that feeling is just ified\ndid you not do something you committed\nyourself to doing no did you do\nsomething you committed yourself not to\ndo no did you violate the explicit moral\nor ethical code of your relationship no\nif the answer to all three of those\nquestions is no then that feeling is not\njustified the guilt likely manifested\ndue to a deeper possibly unconscious\nbelief about say how men should behave\nrelative to women in relationships which\nwas not entirely based on reality"
