    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is frame\ncannot be shared\nso in this episode I'll be responding to\nthe most common objection to my\nconceptualization a frame in my episode\nunderstanding frame I Define frame as\nthe world of the relationship and when\nit comes to heterosexual relationships\neither the man can be in the woman's\nframe or the woman could be in the man's\nframe that's it those are the only two\noptions\nnow the most common objection to this\nformulation goes something like well\nOrion why can't they be in each other's\nframe like why can't both parties leave\nbehind their individual frames and enter\ninto a mutually constructed egalitarian\nframe that serves both people like why\nisn't that possible huh\nso\nI will Begin by conceding that that\nalternative sounds really good like\nthere are a lot of nice and pleasant\nideas in that objection however a little\nlike socialism which is often associated\nwith lofty sentiments and Noble ideals\nthis doesn't really work in practice\nthe truth is that this alternative isn't\nreally possible and I'm here to give you\nthe three primary reasons why frame\ncannot be shared let's get to it\nin the first place it's important to\nappreciate that with respect to most of\nthe important decisions that a couple is\nforced to make compromise is impossible\nfor example if one person wants to live\nin LA and the other person wants to live\nin New York you can't compromise and\nlive in Kansas like that doesn't make\nany sense now neither person is getting\nwhat he or she wants so what's the point\nof the relationship again if one person\nwants kids and the other person doesn't\nyou can't compromise by having half a\nchild\nI'm not yet a father so I'm not an\nexpert when it comes to children but I'm\npretty sure they don't come in half\nsizes you either have one or none at all\nso if the parties want different things\nif the relationship is to continue one\nperson will need to concede to the\nother's frame\nhowever let's complicate this a little\nbit more let's imagine that we're\ndealing with two people who want exactly\nthe same things with respect to these\nbig non-compromisable decisions they met\nin LA but they both want to start a\nfamily in New York they're on the same\npage he's not moving into her house\nshe's not moving into his house they're\ngoing to buy a place together and call\nit our house do you understand isn't\nthat possible Orion\nand I would respond of course it's\npossible people do things like that\nevery day the issue is that the frame\ncannot be shared due to the passage of\ntime\neven if we imagine that both people want\nexactly the same things in exactly the\nsame amount\nthat will change as the days pass and\nreality presents itself\npeople have different interests\npreferences and temperaments life\ndoesn't treat everyone equally what this\nmeans is that in practice when a couple\ndecides to say buy a house in New York\neven if they both want exactly the same\nthing in exactly the same amount in the\nmoment they make that decision\none person is actually going to like\nthat house more than the other one\nperson is actually going to like living\nin New York more than the other one\nperson is actually going to benefit more\nfrom their mutually constructed\nlifestyle than the other\nso even if there are mutuality in those\nbig decisions there isn't equality in\nthe subjective experience of the\nconsequences of those decisions in this\nhypothetical example both parties were\nequal co-creators of this relationship\nframe but that's not how it's going to\nfeel with the passage of time this will\ninevitably create an imbalance in the\nrelationship which means that\nfunctionally and in practice one person\nwill increasingly come to live in the\nother's frame despite the fact that that\nframe was mutually constructed\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nyou can also hit the thanks button it's\nin the lower right hand corner beneath\nthis episode and tip me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've derived from\nthis episode I don't do big sponsorships\nor product placements I rely on your\nsupport to keep all this going and I\nreally appreciate it thank you\nhowever\nlet's now go even one step further than\nthis let's imagine that we're dealing\nwith two people who not only want\nexactly the same things in exactly the\nsame amount but that they track and\ncorrect imbalances in frame as they\npresent themselves over time like they\nregularly check in with how the\nrelationship is going and continue to\nchange the frame in order to approximate\nequality of preference over time\nmaybe one person likes New York more\nthan the other so the other person gets\nto choose which house they get to buy or\nsomething like that with some creativity\nand good communication couldn't these\npeople co-create a mutual frame over\ntime even if it's not possible for two\npeople to like exactly the same things\nin exactly the same amount indefinitely\nwouldn't it be possible for two people\nto create and continuously recreate a\nframe in which both people experience\nthe same net happiness or satisfaction\nand I would respond go ahead and try let\nme see how it goes well it's\ntheoretically possible to live in this\nway the amount of attention and time and\nenergy and money that would need to be\nspent in order to track the subjective\nexperiences of both parties in order to\nensure that one person isn't being\nprivileged more than the other with\nrespect to their Mutual decisions and to\nconstantly make adjustments to the frame\nin order to undo that fluctuating\nprivilege would be considerable it's\ntheoretically possible but it's neither\npractical nor efficient\nmost people don't want to live this way\nbecause in order to live this way you\nspend a sizable amount of the\nrelationship talking about the\nrelationship which is probably one of\nthe least interesting things you can do\nin a relationship and the more time you\nspend on the relationship the less time\nyou have for whatever you got into that\nrelationship to do\nso it's time consuming and inefficient\nit also tends to reduce the\neffectiveness of the relationship this\nis why you don't see frame switching in\nany successful organization or business\non the planet like if you were on a\nplane\nwould you want the pilot and the\nco-pilot to switch roles halfway to the\ndestination like wouldn't it be more\nfair and egalitarian if everyone got a\nchance to be the captain\nhow would you feel about that as a\npassenger\none of the reasons why this doesn't\nhappen is that not only is switching\ninefficient as it takes time and effort\nto make the change and enter into the\nnew frame but it's dangerous as well\nevery step is an opportunity to misstep\nso all other things being equal we\ngenerally want the most parsimonious\nsolution with the fewest moving parts\njust consider what happens every year\nwhen Daylight Saving Time ends and we\nmove the clocks back one hour in the\nmiddle of the night\nthe next day like clockwork pun intended\ntraffic accidents go up absenteeism\nspikes and we collectively experience\nbillions of dollars in losses and\ndamages and that all comes from changing\nthe clocks one hour\nonce a year\nif your changing frame continuously then\nyou're not only likely wasting a lot of\ntime energy and money but you're\nsignificantly increasing your error rate\nand the likelihood that you're working\ntoward inferior outcomes\nin my opinion a better alternative is\nrole complementarity each party should\nfigure out what he or she does well and\nspecialize and that of course would mean\nthat one person would be better at\nconstructing and maintaining the frame\nthan the other and this of course would\ndovetail nicely with my doc metaphor in\nwhich captains build ships their\nLifestyles and invite passengers on\nboard see my episode what is the sexual\nMarketplace for more information\nwhat
