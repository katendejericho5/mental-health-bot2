    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is emotions\nare never irrational\nthat's right emotions are never\nirrational and that's because they can't\nbe it's not possible for an emotion to\nbe irrational only attempts at reason\ncan be rational or irrational it's also\nnot possible for an emotion to be\nillogical only attempts at logic can be\nlogical or illogical emotions make no\nclaim to either reason or logic so they\ncannot be irrational or illogical any\nmore than they can be rational or\nlogical here's the thing behind every\nemotion is a thought now I'm using the\nword thought in its widest possible\nsense thought could be a conscious\ncognition or an unconscious belief or a\nperception or judgment\nbut in almost all cases there's some\nform of thought that precedes the\nemotion you think something you validate\nit as true and the body produces the\nemotional correlate of that thought in\nfact that's one way to think about\nemotions they're embodied cognitions\nthis is why at the core of every hyper\nemotional person you'll find an\noveractive mind\nnow once an emotion is present calling\nit illogical or irrational is useless it\nhas already manifested itself so this is\njust a kind of name calling that refuses\nto accept reality\nand all feelings are valid like\nregardless of the emotion anxious or\nangry or jealous or proud that emotion\nexists and your experience of that\nemotion existing inside of you is valid\nbut here's the thing not all emotions\nare Justified\nvalid and Justified are two different\nthings all emotions are valid not all\nemotions are Justified what does this\nmean\nif behind every emotion is a thought and\nthinking can be irrational or illogical\nthen it's entirely possible that we\nmight be experiencing a valid emotional\nreaction\nto an irrational or illogical thought\nin fact it's probably safer to say that\nthe exception is when this doesn't\nhappen\nthe objective truth of the matter is\nirrelevant the mind can believe anything\nis true and once it does so the person\nwill experience the emotional correlate\nof the content of that belief actually\nit's probably true to say that the\nperson can't not experience the\nemotional correlate of the content of\nthat belief\nin short emotions are valid but the\nthinking on which those emotions are\nbased might not be entirely aligned with\nreality in fact big emotional swings are\ngenerally a sign that one's thinking is\nnot well aligned with reality as reality\ndoesn't tend to change significantly\nfrom one moment to the next it more or\nless continues on as it always has so\nthe more a person's thinking is in line\nwith reality the fewer egocentric\nemotions tend to fluoresce which is\ngenerally experienced as peace\nin any case it can be difficult to\ndetermine within the subjectivity of our\nown Consciousness whether our feelings\nare Justified the best way I found\naround this problem is to run my\nthinking through emotional specific\nprotocols let me explain what I mean\nwith a concrete example\nan emotion that a lot of guys struggle\nwith is guilt this is especially true of\nnice guys who often experience intense\nguilt reactions when they consider\ndisappointing or saying no to a woman\nnow there are many reasons why they may\nhave become possessed of the belief that\nsaying no is transgressive most likely\nhaving to do with their experiences in\nchildhood and their relationship with\ntheir mothers but that's neither here\nnor there for the purposes of this\nconversation my point is that the\nexperiences of these men\nare valid they really do feel guilty\nregardless of whether they should feel\nthat way but that their emotions might\nnot be justified\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton it's in the lower right hand\ncorner beneath the video\nand tip me in proportion of the value\nyou feel you've derived from this\nepisode I don't do big sponsorships or\nproduct placements so I rely on your\nsupport to keep all this going and I\nreally appreciate it thank you for your\nhelp\nnow guilt exists for a reason there is a\nreason why we evolved over millions of\nyears to be able to experience guilt\njust like every other emotion\nthe overarching reason is that emotions\nwhen they are Justified are incredibly\nuseful in motivating adaptive Behavior\ntake guilt\nthroughout most of human history humans\nhave lived in tribes and small\ncommunities breaking our commitments to\nthe community or violating the moral or\nethical standards of the tribe would be\nsubject to punishments including Exile\nwhich was functionally a death sentence\neven in the Modern Age it would be very\nvery difficult for individuals to\nsurvive on their own in the wilderness\nso guilt is both a warning that those\ncommitments or standards may have been\nviolated and a powerful impetus in\nmotivating adaptive Behavior which in\nthis case would look like expressing\nremorse and making amends\nthese behaviors might appease the social\nforces that might otherwise boot the\nindividual from the tribe which would\nthreaten the individual's survival so\nthat's why guilt exists\nall right so what we have to understand\nis that for Guilt to be justified there\nhas to be a violation of a commitment or\na breach of an ethical standard\ngenerally this looks like not doing\nsomething you were committed to do\nsomething you are committed not to do or\ntransgressing the express ethical or\nmoral code of the relationship\norganization or society in which you are\noperating\nthose are the justifiable reasons to\nfeel guilty\nso when I'm working with someone who's\nfeeling guilty I say okay that's how\nyou're feeling that feeling is valid but\nlet's take a look at whether that\nfeeling is Justified\nand we run that feeling through the\nguilt-specific protocol\ndo you did you not do something you\ncommitted yourself to doing\nno\ndid you do something you committed\nyourself not to do\nno\ndid you violate the explicit moral or\nethical code of your relationship\nno\nif the answer all three of those\nquestions is no then that feeling is not\njustified\nthe guilts likely manifested due to a\ndeeper possibly unconscious belief about\nsay how men should behave relative to\nwomen in relationships which was not\nentirely based on reality because it was\nneither predicated on negotiated\ncommitments or explicit responsibilities\nin this case the guilt would be\nunjustified and inappropriate and of\ncourse if the answer to any of those\nquestions is yes then the guilt might in\nfact be justified and appropriate and\nthe individual should move forward with\nhis impulses to remorse and amends\nmaking\nand what should you do if you run an\nemotion through a protocol like this and\nreason that the feeling is unjustified\neasy just consider how the feeling is\ntelling you to behave and behave in the\nopposite way\nnahan calls this opposite action and\nit's very effective so if guilt is\ntelling me to apologize and make amends\nbut I reason that my guilt is\nunjustified then I need to make a\ncommitment not to apologize after all\njust because a person might be upset\nwith me doesn't mean that I've\nnecessarily done anything wrong\nand to kind of double down on my\nposition and stand tall\neither way Mike guilt should start to\nAbate with time if I reason that my\nguilt is Justified and I relent to the\nbehavioral impulse to make amends then\nhaving satisfied the emotional impulse\nthe feeling should start to fade\nand if I reason that my guilt is not\njustified and I consciously Implement a\ncommitment to opposite action then the\nfeeling should also Fade with time this\nis because behaving at odds with my\nemotional experience produces cognitive\ndissonance which is almost always\neventually resolved on the side of\nbehavior because it's what we're\nactually doing that is the most accurate\nbarometer of how we should actually feel\nso either way the emotional experience\nshould diminish with time just keep in\nmind that if you're not used to opposite\naction the emotional experience will\nlikely get more intense before it starts\nto abate\nI used guilt in this specific example\nbut there is a protocol for literally\nevery emotion that a human being has the\ncapacity to feel\nthe key here is to understand that while\nno emotion is irrational emotions are\noften produced from irrational thinking\nand this thinking can be more frequently\nrecognized with protocols like this\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in
