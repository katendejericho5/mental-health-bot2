    "transcript": "dating is an extended hiring process in\nwhich you the man are the employer\nbecause you the man are in a position to\nextend an offer to the woman and not the\nother way around this means that dating\nis really an opportunity to\nsurreptitiously vet a woman for the\nrelationship position of your choosing\nhowever For Better or For Worse Your\nCapacity to do this will be compromised\nby the fact that you will likely be\nattracted to the woman you are vetting\nan attraction does all kinds of things\nto your perception the more you are\nattracted the more distorted your\nperception becomes this is why I\ngenerally recommend that men do not make\nany kind of longterm life-changing\ncommitments to a woman for at least 12\nmonths this gives the couple time to\npass through the crisis of\ndisillusionment in which the weight of\nreality shatters the projected Fantasy\non which the attraction to this point\nwas fundamentally based"
