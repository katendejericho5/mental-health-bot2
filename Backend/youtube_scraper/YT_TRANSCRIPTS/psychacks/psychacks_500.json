    "video_title": "20% of women UNDER 30 are in a POLYGAMOUS relationship",
    "transcript": "the top performing men are not only\nhaving more sex with more women they're\nhaving a lot more sex with a lot more\nwomen so what does this mean well if you\nput two and two together it means that\nSociety is becoming increasingly\npolygamous in which a smaller and\nsmaller subset of men are enjoying a\nlarger share of the sexual access to all\nwomen to put that 5 to4 ratio another\nway this means that 20% of women under\n30 are currently in a polygamous\nrelationship whether they're aware of it\nor not this situation is not conscious\nor intentional but the data back it up\nand just to be clear this is not\nsomething men are doing this is not\nsomething that men are forcing on women\nwhy well in the first place you have to\nremember that more men are getting less\nsex than they had 10 years ago so if\nthis is a conspiracy on the part of men\nthey're doing a really bad job of it and\nin the second place women are\nGatekeepers of sex"
