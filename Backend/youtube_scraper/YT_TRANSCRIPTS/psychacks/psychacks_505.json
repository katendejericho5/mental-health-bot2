    "video_title": "Understanding FRAME: are you living in her world, or is she living in yours?",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nunderstanding frame\nframe is a very important concept and\nits existence often invisibly lies at\nthe core of all relationships it can\nalso be kind of hard to Define for the\ntime being think of frame as the world\nin which the relationship exists are you\nliving in her world or is she living in\nyours\nnow to illustrate this concept I'd like\nto offer an anecdote from a recent\nconsultation I had with a listener I've\nchanged some details to protect his\nidentity and I'm offering this anecdote\nnot to shame or belittle the guy because\nthe fact of the matter is that I take\nthis call almost every day but because\nhis case is so emblematic of a situation\nthat probably millions of men on this\nplanet are experiencing right now the\ndetails might change from person to\nperson but the core issue is extremely\nprevalent\nso I get this call from a 30 year old\nguy living in Washington state he tells\nme that his situation is very urgent\ncan't wait he has to speak to me right\naway and that he needs to make a\ndecision in the next week apparently\nhe's been in a long distance\nrelationship with a 36 year old woman\nliving in Indiana for several years at\nthis point the woman was more or less\ndemanding that he moved to Indiana and\nstart a family with her as she was\napproaching the end of her reproductive\nwindow\nthe guy was a mess he told me that he\nloved and cared for the woman and he\ndidn't want to lose the relationship it\nwas the second relationship with a woman\nhe had ever had that said he told me\nthat they had broken up and gotten back\ntogether several times over the last few\nyears and that he had no interest in\nliving in Indiana he was concerned that\nwithout any friends or family of his own\nin the area he would functionally have\nto spend what little time he had left\nover from work and the baby with her\nfriends and family\nat the point at which he called me he\nwas considering moving forward with the\nagreement as long as he could secure a\npromise from her that he could have an\nhour or two to himself every day\nand after about 10 minutes I just told\nhim to stop stop talking\nthe man was so fully anchored at the\nwoman's offer so fully in the woman's\nframe and so unaware of this reality\nthat he would consider himself fortunate\nif he was allowed an hour of his own\nlife every day for himself\nhe was negotiating for scraps and he\ncouldn't see it\nand he also fully bought into the\nfallacy that it was either the offer the\nwoman put on the table or Nothing at All\nwhich just isn't true though if it's\nsuccessful it's a powerful negotiation\ntactic\nthis guy was so behind the eight ball\nthat he couldn't see anything beyond the\nlimited options presented by this woman\nwhich probably more than anything else\nis emblematic of a man who has\ncompletely abdicated frame\nand a lot of guys find themselves in\nthis situation\nnow this is going to sound harsh this is\ngoing to sound cold but what I counsel\nmen to do in this situation\nis to ignore what the the woman\nwants like pretend even if just for a\nsecond you don't even know what the\nwoman wants erase her wanting from your\nmemory\nand ask yourself what do you want\nand you know what\na lot of guys have never asked\nthemselves this question before at least\nas it pertains to women and they don't\nusually have a ready answer\nin fact they often respond with this\nlook of disbelief on their face that\nsays\nyou mean I have a choice\nyes my brother you have a choice you do\nhave a choice and you don't yet feel\nlike you do because the only way that\nyou've been able to secure your limited\naccess to women is by catering to their\ndesires\nbut this is not the only way not by a\nlong shot\nnow before I get any pushback for this\nsuggestion let's briefly consider what\nthis woman is actually doing in this\nsituation she is functionally demanding\non the threat of revoking the\nrelationship that this man give up his\nlife and enter into hers in Indiana she\nhas her house and her job and her family\nand her friends and she wants babies on\nher timeline and the presumption is that\nthe man continued to work to bankroll\nthis lifestyle to pay for what she wants\nshe's not going to take care of him for\nhis sacrifices the reward for his\nsacrifices is that he gets to take care\nof her\nwhat's more this woman knows this man's\nreservations and reasonable concerns\nknows that he has no interest in living\nin Indiana\nand she's demanding all of this anyway\nwhile I'm asking this man to imagine\nwhat he would do if he was ignorant of\nThis Woman's desires this woman is\nactually behaving like she could give a\nsingle about what this man wants\nthis isn't hypothetical this is actual\nand she's doing this with total impunity\nlike she might not even think that what\nshe's doing is selfish or unusual after\nall she's got to do her\nthis thought experiment works because it\ninvites men to consider how they would\nlive\nif they could live like a woman\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause its Word of Mouth referrals like\nthis that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the thanks button\nit's in the lower right hand corner\nbeneath this episode and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this message\nit's support from viewers like you that\nmake all this happen I don't have a lot\nof product placements or endorsements I\ndepend on your support to keep things\ngoing and I really appreciate it thank\nyou\nso how to respond to all of this\nthe first step is for men to seriously\nconsider how they want to live their\nlives it's not for me to tell people how\nto live each person has to figure out\nthat for himself or herself and I say\ntheir lives I mean that in all of its\naspects not just as pertains to women or\nrelationships ask yourself the following\nquestions is there a woman in my vision\nif so what is she doing there what is\nher role in your life are there children\nin my vision\nif so how am I going to raise them what\nvalues do I want to bring into their\nlives Etc\nand once the man has figured out what he\nwants once he has built his resources\nand extrapolated his lifestyle he can\nthen flip the script and make an offer\nto a woman\nand just to be clear this is not a\nsimple role reversal this is because in\norder to compensate for the sacrifices\nshe might make to enter into his frame\nthe man typically provides provision\nprotection and a better lifestyle than\nthe woman could hope to provide for\nherself\nthese compensations are what typically\ndifferentiate women's offers from Men's\nwomen's offers are generally come into\nmy world and take care of me\nThis Is Why women's offers generally\nsuck\non the other hand men's offers are\ntypically come into my world and I will\ntake care of you\nbig difference\nokay back to my anecdote later in the\nsession I told this guy look imagine you\nwere ignorant of what this woman wanted\nimagine you didn't know that this woman\nwas approaching the end of her\nreproductive window and really wanted\nchildren in the near future\nin the absence of this awareness is\nstarting a family something that you\nyourself would want for your life in the\nnext year or two would you be thinking\nabout this on your own\nand when I ask this question it's like a\nlight bulb turned on above this guy's\nhead because in that moment he realized\nthat none of this was his idea\nmoving to Indiana was not his idea\nbecoming a father next year was not his\nidea spending all of his time with this\nwoman's friends and family was not his\nidea all of these ideas were put into\nhis head by the woman\nhe would never even have been thinking\nabout these things if it weren't for\nthis woman she and these ideas had been\ninsinuated into his mind so long and so\neffectively that he had forgotten that\nthey weren't his ideas\nand it was easy for him to slip more and\nmore into her frame because he didn't\nhave a strong conscious frame of his own\nwith which to counter\nhowever in that moment he remembered his\nown ideas and his response was immediate\nno I'd want to get my life in order\nstart a business develop my social\nnetwork and explore relationships with\ndifferent types of women that's what he\ntold me\nthere you go that's what he wanted\nmy brothers if you ever find yourself\nthinking yeah maybe I could do that\nthat thought is not your thought\nit didn't come from you it's not\nrepresentative of your authentic desire\nwith authentic desire there is no maybe\nsee it from the woman's perspective\nshe's not thinking maybe I could want\nyou moving to Indiana to take care of me\nmaybe there's no maybe here she's very\nclear about what she wants so clear that\nshe's demanding it take a lesson from\nwomen men and learn the difference\nbetween your own authentic desires and\nthose that have been insinuated into\nyour mind by other people\nmen you thrive when you're in your frame\nfigure out what you want and get to work\nget your life in order figure out your\nmission your lifestyle your living\nsituation your money your health your\nfriends and your Social Circle\nget those things squared away\nand then when you meet a woman you like\nyou can say\nthis is me\nthis is what I can offer if you like\nwhat you see then come along for the\nride\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if
