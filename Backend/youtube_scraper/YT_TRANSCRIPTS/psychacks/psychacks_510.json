    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nunderstanding the symptom pool not a\nvery exciting title but a very\ninteresting episode now the symptom pool\nmight be the single most important\nconcept with respect to understanding\nmental illness so if you think the\nmodern world is nuts and you're curious\nto know how we got here then this\nepisode is for you all right to begin\nwith you have to understand that a\nperson who is suffering internally in a\nnon-visible way has a problem\nthis person needs to find ways to\ncommunicate that suffering to other\npeople in a way that they can understand\nthat is likely going to produce the\nlevel of care and concern appropriate to\nthat degree of suffering\nnow you might think well what's wrong\nwith using your words Orion\nwell think about it if I were to come up\nto you and say I'm in a lot of pain and\nI feel very confused my thoughts are so\nchaotic I can barely make sense of them\nand it's so intense that I don't think\nhow much longer I can take it\nyou actually might not take me too\nseriously that's because my statement is\nkind of paradoxical if I really were in\nthat much pain and if my thoughts really\nwere that chaotic could I really talk\nabout my situation in such a rational\ncogent and sensible way the how of my\nmessage would undermine the what of my\nmessage\non the other hand if I were to say stop\npracticing basic hygiene start spending\nall day in bed and begin crying with no\napparent provocation would you really\nbelieve me if I told you with my words I\nfeel perfectly fine never been better\nprobably not and that's because when the\nhow and the what of a message are\nincongruent almost everyone gives\nprecedence to the how\nso direct communication is useful to\nsecuring\ncare and concern for certain degrees of\nsuffering but it doesn't work for more\nelevated degrees of suffering\nthe communication must be deviant enough\nto Signal the presence of a significant\nproblem but often not so deviant as to\ncause others to have the sufferer locked\nup in a padded cell for his or her own\ngood\nthe idea here is that people need to\ntitrate their deviants from social norms\nto Signal other people to render the\nappropriate degree of care and concern\nand the way that this is done is through\nsomething called the symptom pool\nthe symptom pool is a collection of\nconstantly evolving culturally bound\ncommunication strategies for expressing\ndifferent levels of suffering\neveryone influences the symptom pool but\nno one controls it what's more few\npeople consciously choose to manifest\nthese symptoms that is very few people\nintentionally use these strategies\ninstrumentally we call these people\nmalingerers rather most people Implement\nthese strategies unconsciously which is\nwhat is so fascinating sufferers are\ngenerally conscious of their symptoms\nbut they're not conscious of why these\nparticular symptoms manifested as\nopposed to some other symptoms\nthe symptom pool is generally cultivated\nunintentionally and unconsciously at the\npopulation level and the symptoms\ngenerally manifest unintentionally and\nunconsciously at the individual level\nnow these communication strategies are\nalways connected to certain times and\nplaces which is why we can kind of\nconsider almost every form of mental\nillness to be a culturally bound\nsyndrome and this is also why we see for\nlack of a better word fads with respect\nto mental illness like some ways of\ncommunicating distress come into favor\nin certain times and places spread\nwildly and then completely disappear\nfor example there have been almost no\ncases of glove paralysis or\nneuroesthesia or hysterical pregnancy\nfor quite some time despite the fact\nthat all three of these conditions were\nextremely common in the 19th century\nand this is very strange of course\nbecause if there were a clear biological\nor genetic correlate for these sorts of\nthings well it's doubtful that those\ncorrelates would have been so completely\nweeded out of the gene pool over the\nlast 100 years even more perplexing is\nthe fact that say hysterical pregnancy\nwas almost never seen in Highly Educated\nwomen\nand neurosthesia was almost never seen\nin the working class\nhow a presumably biologically determined\nsyndrome could have been influenced by\nclass and education is rather peculiar\nisn't it but let's keep moving forward\nnow before I do that if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this episode to someone who\nmight benefit from its message because\nit's Word of Mouth referrals like this\nthat really help to make the channel\ngrow you can also hit the thanks button\nwhich is in the lower right hand corner\nbeneath this episode and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nderived from this message I don't do\nproduct placements or endorsements so\nthis helps me keep the lights on I\nreally appreciate your support thank you\nokay so in any given time and place\nindividuals have an unconscious\nunderstanding of how they need to behave\nin order to communicate that they are\ninsufficient emotional pain to motivate\ncare and concern from others\nbut the thing is that we have to be very\ncareful about this for two reasons in\nthe first place we can inadvertently\nintroduce ideas into the symptom pool\nthat don't have to be there and this in\nturn can unintentionally motivate people\nto manifest these symptoms in ways that\nwe didn't intend\nironically one of the primary ways that\nthis is done is through awareness\ncampaigns\nto illustrate how this works I'm going\nto take an example from Ethan waters's\nexcellent book crazy like us the\nglobalization of the American psyche\nit's very readable and highly relevant\nwith respect to recent goings on\nthe first chapter of this book looks at\nthe rise of anorexia in Hong Kong in the\n90s now anorexia is a very serious\ndisorder most people don't know this but\nit actually has one of the highest\nfatality rates among all mental\nillnesses higher even than depression so\nit's something that needs to be taken\nseriously it's also something that\nfunctionally does not exist in the\ndeveloping World unfortunately there are\nstill people who are underfed and\nmalnourished but this is not because\nthey are intentionally depriving\nthemselves of food if there is food\navailable\nanorexia is almost exclusively a\ndisorder of privilege affluence and\ncivilization\nbut where it exists it can create a lot\nof Devastation and misery\nso in the 1990s some well-meaning\npsychiatrists from the West came to Hong\nKong on a mission\nthey had seen how dangerous and terrible\nanorexia could be and they wanted to\nspread awareness of this issue so that\nit might be proactively prevented or at\nleast treated appropriately\nand what these folks would say is\nsomething like anorexia is a rare but\ndangerous condition it generally affects\nyoung people especially young educated\nupper-class women perhaps you've heard\nabout it because celebrity X recently\nconfessed that she struggled it\nstruggled with it in her past in any\ncase this isn't something to be judged\nit's something to be understood and\ncared for and we're here to offer you\nthe tools to do just that\nsounds reasonable enough right\nand well-meaning newspapers and media\nOutlets did their part to spread the\ncampaign of awareness far and wide what\na good deed\nnow what do you think happened\naccording to a newspaper at the time\nanorexia which was previously\nnon-existent in Hong Kong saw a 2500\npercent increase in the exact population\nthe psychiatrist indicated in just a few\nshort years\nincredible like who could have predicted\nthat would happen\nnow sometimes people respond to this by\nsaying okay well maybe the awareness\ncampaigns did their job Orion and they\nbrought a previously unrecognized\nproblem to light by making screening and\ndiagnosis more accurate and there may be\nsome truth to that perspective like I'm\nsure that happens from time to time\nhowever that can't possibly be the case\nhere by definition anorectics must be\nmore than 15 percent below the minimally\nnormal weight for their height and age\nand that's just not something that could\nhave been hidden on that level\nlike oh this is anorexia I just thought\nmy daughter was starving thank you for\neducating me on its proper name like\nthat almost certainly didn't happen\non the other hand would almost certainly\ndid happen is that you had a group of\nrespected authorities doctors in white\ncoats with all the paraphernalia of\nScientific Technology talking directly\nto adolescents saying that there is a\nrare read special condition that tends\nto inflict young women of status and\nprivilege like celebrities whether you\nare aware of it or not\npart of what these psychiatrists were\ndoing was educating young girls in how\nthey can signal their membership in\ncertain classes of society using all\ntheir power and authority these doctors\nindelibly Associated a certain\ncommunication strategy with a certain\nsegment of the population young female\nhigh status in the symptom pool\nthey did this unconsciously and\nunintentionally but they did so\nnonetheless and while most of the girls\nwho subsequently suffered from anorexia\ncommunicated their distress\nunconsciously unintentionally their\nsuffering was real regardless\nthis is the first way we have to be\ncareful about the symptom pool\nthe second way has to do with secondary\ngain\nsecondary gain is the positive side of\nsuffering or the benefits that accrue to\none's status as a victim\nin this example the doctors were adamant\nthat these girls not be judged or\ncriticized rather they should be given\nSpecial Care taken out of school if\nnecessary and healed with understanding\ntherapies these girls needed attention\nand consideration and should be praised\nfor their courage and dedication for\novercoming this Dreadful disease\nagain I'm not saying that these girls in\nHong Kong consciously thought to\nthemselves okay I'm gonna starve myself\nso people will pay attention to me and\nsee me as a courageous High status\nvictim\nnone of this is conscious that's the\namazing thing about the symptom pool all\nof this occurs unconsciously both at the\npopulation level and the individual\nlevel\nhowever by conducting their awareness\ncampaign in this manner psychiatrists\nbasically succeeded in significantly\nspreading a mental illness that up until\nthen was kind of culturally bound to the\nCivilized West and of course their\nmessage was all the more impactful\nbecause it targeted young people\nChildren and adolescents who all other\nthings being equal are the most\nsusceptible to arguments of authority\nand the benefits of secondary gain\nso this was just one example Waters\noffers several other well-documented\nexamples in his book so check it out if\nyou're interested and this kind of thing\nis by no means an historical artifact it\ncontinues to go on in the present day on\nsome level it may be unavoidable however\nit may also be mitigated ironically with\nawareness\nawareness about awareness its benefits\nand its liabilities\nsomething to consider what do you think\ndoes this fit with your own experience\nlet me know in the comments
