    "transcript": "what you have to understand is that in\nthe beginning you are basically a blank\nslate to other people folks are going to\ntake a look at your physical appearance\nand the way you dress and the way you\ncarry yourself and form some snap\njudgments with respect to the kind of\nperson you might be and that's why first\nimpressions are so important however a\nlot of the things that go into a first\nimpression can actually be proactively\naddressed prior to Any Given interaction\nyou can give a lot of thought to your\ndress and your appearance and your\ncarriage in advance and if you do these\nkind of passively exert their influence\nthroughout the encounter so you can\nfocus on other things in the beginning\npeople don't know much more about you\nbesides that which means that in these\ninitial interactions what you're\nprimarily doing no matter what you are\nostensibly discussing is teaching people\nhow they should feel about you and you\ndo this through your nonverbals your\ntone your expression your body language\nyour eye contact Etc and if you're like\nmost people you probably want whomever\nyou're speaking with to come away from\nthe interaction with a positive\nimpression of you"
