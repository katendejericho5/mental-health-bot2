    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is May all\nbeings be free of suffering\nso like many of you I have a morning\nroutine that includes a prayer and a\nmeditation and one of the components of\nthis practice is that I consciously ask\nfor and intentionally pray that all\nbeings may be free of suffering this is\na traditional Buddhist chant or prayer\nand it forms the essence of what we\nmight call a loving-kindness meditation\nI do this almost every morning and I've\ndone this almost every morning for years\nas a therapist I get to see the\nsuffering of individuals firsthand at\nfirst blush many people seem to be\nperfectly fine they are high functioning\nthey can hold a job pay their taxes and\nmaintain their relationships however\nwhen people start to tell the truth\nabout how they're really feeling you\nquickly realize how much suffering and\nhow much unnecessary suffering exists on\nthis planet and I hate to see it like I\nwish it would just all go away\nand that's what motivated me to begin to\npray that all beings be free of\nsuffering\nnow in the beginning I would pray for\nspecific things to happen like may this\nperson's cancer go away or made this\nperson's heartbreak be resolved or may\nthis person's business be successful\nEtc it's like I saw how people were\nstruggling and I wanted to remove what\nseemed to be the external causes of that\nsuffering understandable right wouldn't\nthe world contain less suffering without\nthat disease or that pain or that\ndifficulty and I did that for a long\ntime\nhowever you really only have to think\nabout this for about 30 seconds before\nrealizing how silly it is praying like\nthis is treating God like Santa Claus\nit's like sending your wish list to the\nNorth Pole and waiting for Christmas\nmorning\nnow there's nothing wrong with asking\nfor good things it's certainly better\nthan the alternative but the idea that\nsuffering is going to be removed from\nthis planet miraculously by some\nSupernatural Force providing the outcome\nI wish for in my own private\nConsciousness is absurd and immature\nprayer doesn't work like that and it\ndoesn't work like that because that's\nnot how suffering works\nwhat does this mean\nthe fact of the matter is that the vast\nmajority of suffering on this planet is\nunnecessary and that unnecessary\nsuffering is caused by ignorance of\ncourse malice exists but malice is\nactually a special form of ignorance and\nignorance of the underlying nature of\nreality\nif it's true that most people are\ngenerally doing the best they can then\nit must also be true that most people\nhave a lot to learn\ntheir consciousnesses are dark and\nconfused and they are also mostly\nresponsible for the suffering that they\nexperience which has more to do with\ntheir thoughts beliefs and behaviors\nthan with external reality\njust think about it\nwas that cancer patient peaceful and\ncontent prior to his diagnosis\nwas that heartbroken woman grateful and\njoyful before her relationship ended\nwas that business owner hopeful and\nequilibrated before his money problems\nalmost certainly not if it wasn't cancer\nor heartbreak or failure it would have\nbeen something else\njust consider how discontent so many\npeople are in the midst of relative\nsafety abundance convenience comfort and\nstability\nif suffering especially the unnecessary\nkind has much more to do with our\njudgment and understanding than it has\nto do with external reality\nthen what real good is it to change the\ncircumstances of external reality\nthat's like a doctor who treats a\npatient's symptoms because he lacks the\nknowledge or ability to cure the\nunderlying disease\nit was at this point that I realized\nthat in praying that all beings may be\nfree of suffering what I was\nfunctionally asking for and hoping for\nwas for people to finally wake the\nup\nand understand the extent to which they\nare contributing to their pain and\nsuffering and difficulty by examining\nthemselves their thoughts and beliefs\ntheir words and actions their judgments\nand perceptions\npeople need to understand that suffering\narises within themselves and that it\nthis must be the place from which that\nsuffering is removed\nthe desire that people be free of\nsuffering is isomorphic with the desire\nthat people wake the up\nthat's what's actually required to\ntransform this world\nnow before I go any further if you like\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nhitting the thanks button it's right\nunderneath the video that you're\nwatching right now and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you\nderive from this message\nit's word of it's these little donations\nthat make all of this possible you see I\ndon't do a lot of like big product\nendorsements and things like that so I\nkind of rely on these donations to make\neverything possible I really appreciate\nyour support thank you\nnow\ndon't think about the person that really\nneeds to hear this message\nyou're the person who really needs to\nhear this message you're the person who\nneeds to wake the up\nyou still suffer and I'm sure you do\nthis message is meant for you\nif you continue to suffer you haven't\nyet arrived at full awareness if you\ncontinue to experience impatience and\nanger and despair and hopelessness and\nenvy you haven't woken up yet your\nthinking is still clouded and your\nbeliefs don't yet align with reality\nand as you awaken you will experience\npain\namong other forms there will be the pain\nof realizing how wrong you've been for\nso long and the pain of realizing how\nlittle time you may have left to make\nthings right\nthe pain of Awakening\nis painful but as I discussed in one of\nmy very first episodes pain is\ninevitable we need to choose the path\nthat takes us where we want to go as\nopposed to the path that seems to\ncontain less pain that's likely an\nillusion and with greater awareness we\ncan divest ourselves of our delusion and\nignorance and increasingly walk in the\ndirection of light and Truth\nand that's probably the only way we're\ngoing to get out of here\nit's also important to appreciate the\ngeneral Consciousness on this planet is\nstill very low it's higher than it used\nto be but still pretty low\nhowever what I've discovered is that as\na person wakes up that Awakening\nradiates out from that individual\nthrough his or her relationships to\naffect others and that these individual\nAwakenings begin to create a positive\neffect for their close relationships for\ntheir communities for their little parts\nof the world\nand these Awakenings make it much more\nlikely that another person will be\nwilling and able to drop the illusion\nthe delusion and the ignorance and begin\nto wake up as well\nsometimes all it takes is a model of\ncourage and peace a lot of people didn't\nhave that\na lot of people have had bad teachers\nwhich helps to explain their performance\nas students if you don't have one find\none and if you found one be one\nthat's the path forward\nso that's what I wanted to say stop\nseeking the causes of suffering outside\nof yourself because you're looking in\nthe wrong place if you still suffer you\nneed to look inside and determine what\nbeliefs thoughts or behaviors are\nresponsible for that suffering and work\nto bring those things more in line with\ntruth and reality it's not an easy\nprocess it's not a process devoid of\npain but really what the else are\nyou going to do with your time\nit's our best possible chance not only\nof minimizing our own unnecessary\nsuffering but of making the world a less\nhellacious place as well\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this
