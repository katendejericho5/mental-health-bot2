    "transcript": "this phrase I have plenty of time is one\nthat I've heard from many many women\nover the course of my dating history\nhowever this isn't really the case the\ntruth is that many women have been lied\nto or at least they haven't been told\nthe whole truth or perhaps they haven't\nbeen told the whole truth in a way that\nthey were able to hear and I hope to be\nable to do that today I dislike being\nthe bearer of bad news but if you're a\nwoman and you haven't yet locked down a\nlong-term relationship by the time that\nyou are 30 you are at a disadvantage and\nthat disadvantage increases with each\npassing year it's not a coincidence that\nthe average age at first marriage in\nthis country is right before the moment\nwhen the average man's sexual\nMarketplace value begins to exceed the\naverage woman's sexual Marketplace value\nfor the very first time I talk about\nthat more in my episode why people get\nmarried when they do the point is that\nthe game changes significantly at 30."
