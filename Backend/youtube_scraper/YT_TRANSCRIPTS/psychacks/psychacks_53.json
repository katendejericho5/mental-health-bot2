    "transcript": "this is why I say that women's greatest\nenemy is their pride pride prevents\npeople from selling at a perceived loss\nhowever the longer they wait the greater\nthe perceived loss tends to be this\nmeans there are really only two\nstrategies here if you're committed to\ngoing all the way and seeing your house\npotentially burn to the ground without\nreceiving any compensation for your loss\nwhich is absolutely you're right then\ndon't budge don't ever move not a single\ninch however be serious with yourself if\nyou're not actually willing to see the\nstandoff all the way to its ultimate\nconclusion if you're not willing to see\nyour house reduced to ashes then you\nshould lower your gun as quickly as\npossible and accept the offer because\nthe longer you wait the more your house\nwill burn and the worse the next offer\nwill be just like escaping the sunken\ncost fallacy you have to let go of the\npast in order to save your future"
