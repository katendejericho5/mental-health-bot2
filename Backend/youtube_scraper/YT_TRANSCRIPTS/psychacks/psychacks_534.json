    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why I do\nwhat I do\nto answer this question I'd like to\nshare a brief anecdote from my life my\nhope is that it will reveal a guiding\nprinciple for much of what I do both\npersonally and professionally\nso one Saturday night about 15 years ago\nI was wandering around the East Village\nin New York City checking in on my\nhaunts and generally looking for trouble\nand as I was walking around I found\nmyself on the corner of Broadway and\n14th Street just off Union Square and it\nwas there that I encountered the\nfollowing scene\napparently the street light had been\ntaken out of commission and the traffic\nwas at a standstill clear across\nManhattan like from the East River all\nthe way to the Hudson And as far up and\ndown Broadway as the eye could see I\nmean this is a major intersection there\nwere thousands of cars flashing their\nlights and honking their horns it was\nMadness and it was chaos and nobody was\ndoing anything about it there weren't\nany cops around and the pedestrians just\nshook their heads in disbelief before\ncarrying on their way it was nuts and I\nremember looking at the situation and\nthinking to myself man this is crazy\nsomeone needs to do something about this\nand once it became clear after a few\nminutes that no one was going to do\nanything about this I thought to myself\nokay well I guess I'll do it\nnow it probably helped that I had a\ncouple of drinks in me at that point but\nI walked right into the intersection of\nBroadway and 14th and started directing\ntraffic this was not because I knew what\nI was doing I had never directed traffic\nin my life I just saw that there was a\nvery obvious problem that was affecting\npeople and no one else seemed willing or\nable to do anything about it and in the\nabsence of an alternative I was elected\nso I stood there in the intersection and\nI started to direct traffic as best I\ncould I would hold up my hand and send\ncars up and down 14th for a while and\nthen I would jump into the flow and give\nthe Broadway cars a chance some drivers\nwere hesitant to follow my suggestions\nand I definitely got some strange looks\nfrom others but mostly I got cheers and\nhigh fives and thank yous it was obvious\nto most people that I was trying to help\nsolve a problem that no one else was\ndoing and I did that for about an hour\nand a half it took about an hour and a\nhalf for the cops to show up and when\nthey did they basically told me to\noff uh before taking over the situation\nand so I did and went on with the rest\nof my night\nso that anecdote kind of describes how I\napproach life if there's an obvious\nproblem and no one else seems willing or\nable to do anything about it it's like\nI've been elected to do my best to\naddress that problem until such time\ncomes when somebody who has more\ncompetence experience or ability can\ntake the job from me that's why I do\nwhat I do I'm not always the smartest or\nthe wisest or the most capable sometimes\nI'm just the guy willing to do it\non this channel I started talking about\nintersexual Dynamics about a year ago\nand many of those talks have been some\nof the more popular episodes on this\nchannel\nthat's because I see what's going on\nbetween men and women today to be like\nthe intersection of 14th and Broadway\nall those years ago it's chaos and\nMadness and people are either fuming in\ntheir cars or shaking their heads as\nthey walk past I look around and no\ncommentators that I've heard are\noffering solutions that I think are\nacceptable and once it became clear\nafter a while that no one was going to\ndo anything about it I thought to myself\nokay well I guess I'll do it I've been\nelected\ndoes this mean that I'm the very best\nperson for this job probably not\ncould other people do the job better\nthan I do very possibly but here's the\nthing whoever those people are as far as\nI can see they aren't doing it yet once\nthey show up they are more than welcome\nto take over and I am more than happy to\ngo on my Merry way but until that day\ny'all are kind of stuck with me\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you may also consider\nhitting the thanks button it's right\nbeneath the video that you're watching\nright now and tip me in proportion to\nthe value you feel you've received from\nthis message because it's your support\nthat makes all this happen I couldn't do\nit without you\num you'll notice I don't do a bunch of\nin video product placements or\nendorsements like other channels this\ndoesn't generate a lot of Revenue so I\nreally do depend on your donations for\nsupport thank you very much\nnow the goal of this channel is to\nreduce unnecessary human suffering and\nin so doing make the world a better\nplace it's very easy to walk past the\nintersection it's very easy to become\nenraged at the situation or about\nthe infrastructure or complain it took\nso long of the cops to show up or find\nfault in my bumbling solution\nit is much harder to direct traffic\nbut it's like my dudes the peanut\ngallery is full there is standing room\nonly we don't need more people to point\nout the problem we're all aware\nof what the problem is it's loud and\nobvious and in our faces what we need\nare people who are willing to be part of\nthe solution\nand that's especially true for guys men\nit's not a good look spending your lives\nin the peanut gallery you should be down\nhere in the streets with me in the\nintersection directing traffic that's\nwhere you belong and I guarantee if you\nwere to do that it would be of more use\nto you than to me\nthere is no lack of problems that need\nsolving on this planet just look the\n around but here's the thing every\nproblem is also an opportunity for you\nto step up to get involved to grow your\ncapacity to declare I exist\nin that story the people who just walked\nby didn't really exist they were NPCs in\nthat anecdote to be a player character\nyou have to find a problem and work\ntowards its solution do you understand\nand you don't need to do this on the\nworld stage like if you don't yet have\nsufficient experience solving smaller\nproblems you should not be shooting for\nthat kind of goal that's arrogant and\nabsurd but just look around there's look\nat your house your relationships your\nfamily your community your school your\ntown there is plenty of people who need\nhelp there are plenty of problems that\nneed solving and if no one else is doing\nit guess what you've just been\nelected congrats here's your sash all\nthe best to you\nit's like become part of the solutions\nmy dudes and my ladies it's so easy to\nfind faults it's so easy to criticize\nbut the world doesn't need any more\ncritics my friends the world needs\npeople who are in the intersection\nthe day may come when someone more\nconfident shows up and says all right I\ngot this but until that happens keep\ndirecting traffic it's in the street\nthat you discover who you are and it's\nthere that you find your place among men\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this
