    "transcript": "the idea is to approach love in the\nspirit of abundance abundance doesn't\ntally up the bill abundance doesn't keep\nscore it's the nature of abundance to be\ngenerous and it gives not because it\nexpects anything in return but because\nit kind of can't hold itself back the\nsun doesn't feel cheated because it's\ngifts aren't returned in kind it doesn't\neven really notice what we're doing with\nits light and warmth it's too busy\nradiating its refulgence again if you're\nnot getting what you want from a\nrelationship just move on and continue\nto shine shine when someone says yes\nshine when someone says no shine\nimpartially and with indifference to\noutcome do this and you'll find it's a\npathway to spiritual evolution"
