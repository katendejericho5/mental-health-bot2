    "transcript": "when practiced correctly love like light\nis abundant and impartial the sun like\nthe true lover isn't bothered when he\nisn't sufficiently praised or\nacknowledged or respected because again\nit's not shining for any of these things\nit's shining because it's a fing star\nand it's in a star's nature to shine the\nmost essential attribute of the Sun from\na spiritual perspective is its humility\nit is by far the most important\ncomponent of the solar system and it's\nfunctionally responsible for maintaining\nall life on this Earth it has every\nright to be a tyrant to demand praise\nand sacrifice and respect and\nappreciation but what we see is the\nexact opposite a humility bordering\nparadoxically on invisibility if we\nactually had to acknowledge our\ndependence on the sun and appropriately\nexpress our gratitude we would have to\nspend our entire lives just singing its\npraises"
