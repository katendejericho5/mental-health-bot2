    "transcript": "love is a gift given through the\nspontaneous generosity of The Giver\nwithout any strings attached it doesn't\nexpect anything in return because there\nis no need to repay it and this is\nbecause love like sunlight is invaluable\nit cannot be bought at any price so it's\nbest to make a gift out of it the sun's\nhumility is Manifest in its being the\nmost exalted feature of our world while\nexpecting nothing in return and\nexperiencing satisfaction in its own\ninvisibility as we go about our happy\nlittle lives\nthat's love"
