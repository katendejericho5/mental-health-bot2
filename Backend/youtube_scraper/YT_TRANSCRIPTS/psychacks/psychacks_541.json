    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is Love Like\nthe Sun\nlove is a very misunderstood word this\nis because we have one word to describe\nmany different experiences and phenomena\nand in my opinion the word Love is\nmisapplied in the vast majority of cases\nas discussed in a previous episode love\nhas nothing to do with relationships\nrelationships are the medium through\nwhich value is transacted and love is\ninvaluable it can't be bought at any\nprice therefore it has nothing to do\nwith relationships this is why you don't\nneed love to have a relationship and you\nalso don't need a relationship in order\nto love but you do need a relationship\nin order to get other things that do\nhave transactable value\nin today's episode I'm going to be\ntalking about how to love\nmy model for how to love is the sun I'm\nnot there yet but one day I hope to be\nable to love like the sun let's unpack\nwhat that means it's impossible to\noverstate the importance of the sun it's\nnot an exaggeration to say that the sun\nis responsible for maintaining Life as\nWe Know It On This Planet if the sun\nwere to stop shining or were to\notherwise disappear life would face an\nirreversible collapse within a matter of\nhours we need the sun more than we can\npossibly acknowledge or could ever repay\nand that's why it's such a blessing that\nthe sun shines as a gift\nsince a gift is given through the\nspontaneous generosity of The Giver\nwithout any strings attached there's no\nneed to repay it\nthe sun doesn't shine because it expects\nanything in return which is fantastic\nbecause how could we possibly recompense\nthe sun if we were in its debt the same\nis true of love love is a gift given\nthrough the spontaneous generosity of\nThe Giver without any strings attached\nit doesn't expect anything in return\nbecause there is no need to repay it and\nthis is because love like sunlight is\ninvaluable it cannot be bought at any\nprice so it's best to make a gift out of\nit do you understand\nnow the sun doesn't Grumble when some of\nits Rays fall on people who are\nungrateful another hot sunny day this is\ngetting insufferable\nlike the sun is kind of indifferent to\nhow its light is received and this\nindifference allows it to shine on\neveryone equally it doesn't save its\nlight for the people who like it or\nappreciate it or praise it or reward it\nit kind of doesn't even notice where its\nlight is going it just sort of radiates\nits goodness and it does this not\nbecause it expects anything in return\nwhich again is great because how could\nwe pay back the Sun but because that's\njust who the Sun is\nit's in the sun's nature to shine like\nit can't not shine it can't not radiate\nlight and warmth it's an expression of\nits being and it would go against its\nnature to dim that light or suffocate\nthat warmth or dull either out partially\nwhen practiced correctly love like light\nis abundant and impartial\nthe sun like the true lover isn't\nbothered when he isn't sufficiently\npraised or acknowledged or respected\nbecause again it's not shining for any\nof these things it's shining because\nit's a star\nin it's in a star's nature to shine do\nyou understand\nnow the most essential attribute of the\nSun from a spiritual perspective is its\nhumility\nit is by far the most important\ncomponent of the solar system and its\nfunctionally responsible for maintaining\nall life on this Earth it has every\nright to be a tyrant\nto demand praise and sacrifice and\nrespect and appreciation\nbut what we see is the exact opposite\na humility bordering paradoxically on\ninvisibility\nif we actually had to acknowledge our\ndependence on the sun and appropriately\nexpress our gratitude we would have to\nspend our entire lives just singing its\nPraises we wouldn't be able to serve\nothers or watch baseball games or read\nbooks or cook souffles or take naps or\nreally do any of the thousands of things\nthat human beings love to do\nthis is the sun's invisibility it's\nstrange to think about it since it\nradiates light and kind of makes all\nvisibility possible\nbut just try to look at the Sun for more\nthan a few seconds your vision will\nstart to go black you won't be able to\nsee it so its Radiance is actually its\nmodesty and its humility\nand since we literally can't see the sun\nsince we can't be in a direct\nrelationship with it we're functionally\nforced to kind of go about our business\nas if it didn't exist while benefiting\nimmensely from its light and warmth\nand you know what that doesn't bother\nthe Sun\nthe sun's humility is Manifest in its\nbeing the most exalted feature of our\nworld while expecting nothing in return\nand experiencing satisfaction in its own\ninvisibility as we go about our happy\nlittle lives\nthat's love\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton it's right beneath the video that\nyou're watching right now and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel that\nyou've derived from this message because\nit's your support that makes all of this\npossible I couldn't do it without you\nand I really appreciate your support\nthank you\nnow the closest approximation that we\nhave to this feeling\nis the satisfaction that some parents\nfeel when they watch their children\nplaying a little in the distance\nif they got any closer they would\ninterfere with the play and disrupt the\nmoment so they are content to remain\ninvisible and that's because love only\nseeks after the benefit of the other and\nthinks nothing of itself it's the\nhumiliated self-exultant\nthese parents are just happy that there\nis a safe place for those children to\nrun and jump and sing and laugh\nthey don't mind that their children\naren't reciprocating comparable value or\nexpressing their gratitude or respecting\ntheir Authority and that's because these\nthings actually aren't nearly as\nsatisfying and precious as witnessing a\nhappiness that believes itself to be\nunobserved\nand that's why the highest response to\nlove is not praise or appreciation or\neven gratitude\nit's Joy\nand it's love that makes Joy possible\nloving like the sun also means loving\nabundantly love doesn't keep score or\nworry that it's being cheated or being\ntaken advantage of even if someone were\nto use or to steal some of the Sun's\nlight how is the sun possibly diminished\nremember love is not transactional which\nmakes it unconditional our time energy\nand money might be limited but love is\nnot in fact it's actually possible to\ntap into the source of love and\nexperience it like the sun as a\nfunctionally inexhaustible resource\nthere is no scarcity here because love\nis abundant and inexhaustible\nnow if you're not getting what you want\nfrom a relationship for whatever reason\nthen just move on\nlove wouldn't want you to suffer\nneedlessly out of a misguided sense of\nDuty\nthat's a form of projected spite born\nout of your own unhealed disappointments\nand if you feel betrayed or\nunappreciated or unreciprocated then\njust let go and find someone else\nand there's no need to get upset you can\ndo this with love remember love is an\nadverb it's a quality of action you can\nsay no thank you it's time for me to\nmove on with as much love as you can say\nyeah let's continue to walk together for\na while\nand this is especially important because\nyou can only really let go of someone in\nlove anger is a clenched fist it holds\non tight and won't let go love on the\nother hand is an open hand or more to\nthe point of this episode broad daylight\nit allows things to come and go in their\nown time\nthe idea is to approach love in the\nspirit of abundance abundance doesn't\ntally up the bill abundance doesn't keep\nscore it's the nature of abundance to be\ngenerous and it gives not because it\nexpects anything in return but because\nit kind of can't hold itself back the\nsun doesn't feel cheated because its\ngifts aren't returned in kind it doesn't\neven really notice what we're doing with\nits light and warmth it's too busy\nradiating its refugence\nagain if you're not getting what you\nwant from a relationship just move on\nand continue to shine when someone says\nyes shine when someone says no shine\nimpartially and with indifference to\noutcome\ndo this and you'll find it's a pathway\nto spiritual Evolution because the more\nyou do this the more you'll discover\nthat you are the one that you've been\nlooking for\nyou don't get love you merely increase\nyour capacity to express it and it's in\nthe expression of love that you feel it\nwhen people say that they feel love what\nthey're really feeling is their own love\nleaving them\nthat's actually true of all emotions so\nto get more love you actually have to\nbecome more loving\nand this is how you do that\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like
