    "transcript": "the cultivation of authentic confidence\nwhich is the consistent felt experience\nof success can take some time when I\nfirst started out as a therapist it took\nme about five years to really find my\nclinical voice and my professional\nidentity and I might not have been able\nto get there any faster even if I knew\nthen what I know now these things just\ntake time and repetition and a\nwillingness to tolerate that process\nfinally especially in the beginning it\nmight be useful to set your standards\nfor satisfactory performance pretty low\nlike you might have done a good enough\njob simply by virtue of the fact that\nyou didn't make the situation any worse\nthan it was before you can start low and\nthen titrate up as you gain more\nexperience and expertise this is\nappropriate it's like a scaffolded\napproach to professional competence"
