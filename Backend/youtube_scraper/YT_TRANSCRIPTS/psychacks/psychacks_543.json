    "transcript": "first of all it's useful to appreciate\nthe vast majority of people don't really\nknow what they're doing and they're in\npositions of power and authority anyway\nthis is because the number of problems\nthat exist greatly exceeds the number of\ncompetent people capable of solving them\nSociety is a conglomeration of imperfect\npeople imperfectly helping each other\nremembering this should not only help\npeople approach others with greater\npatience and compassion but allow people\nto treat themselves with greater\npatience and compassion as well you\nshould also keep in mind that most\npeople don't have the bandwidth to\nreally look too closely at whatever\nyou're doing because they're too\npreoccupied with themselves you are at\nbest a cameo in the lives of almost\neveryone else so the pressure is kind of\noff no one is looking at you even a\nfraction as closely as you believe that\nthey might be"
