    "transcript": "the second principle obstruction is that\nsome people just see pain as something\nto Bear now there is a time and a place\nto grit your teeth and carry your cross\nand tolerate the pain of existence but\nif you simply tolerate pain if you\nsimply bear it then you might not\ncultivate any curiosity about why you\nmay be in pain to begin with you just\nkind of think of it as a burden you need\nto carry for as long as you have to and\nso the pain is sort of a wasted\nopportunity what I've discovered is that\na great deal of the pain that exists on\nthis planet is due to the fact that\npeople don't know why they're in pain\nthere's a saying that ignorance is bliss\nno it's not a crying baby is not\nBlissful most people are suffering\nbecause like the infant they don't know\nwhy they're suffering if they knew why\nthey were suffering Not only would they\nquickly and significantly reduce their\nsuffering but they could also\npotentially generate meaning and\ncultivate wisdom as well"
