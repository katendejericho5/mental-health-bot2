    "transcript": "pain is the universe giving you feedback\nthat you need to pay attention to a\nparticular aspect of your life because\npain is a signal that your model of\nreality is incorrect and pain is your\nopportunity to bring that model into\ncloser Conformity with the way things\nreally are if you can alter your\nrelationship with pain you will\naccelerate your self-development 100\nfold so what prevents people from using\nthe opportunity inherent in pain well\nthere are many potential obstructions\nbut three principal ones the first\nprinciple obstruction is that some\npeople are so stubborn or arrogant or\nideologically possessed that they double\ndown on their incorrect version of\nreality they continue to believe that\ntheir right despite their pain they hold\non to the belief that the way they think\nthings should be is how reality should\nin fact operate so arrogance and\nideological possession can prevent\npeople from entering into this\nopportunity"
