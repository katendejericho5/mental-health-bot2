    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to be\nwise so this is a question that has come\nup repeatedly not only in the comments\non this channel but in individual\nconsultations as well people have\nexpressed their curiosity as to how it\nis I've learned the things that I talk\nabout on this channel I certainly didn't\nlearn them from a book let alone grad\nschool\nand I usually respond that to the extent\nthat I am wise I am wise through pain\nand insight\nthat's the secret recipe for wisdom pain\nplus insight some people think that\nwisdom is simply the result of\nexperience or age and that is certainly\nnot true the world is full of old fools\nthat might feel disrespectful but simply\nnot dying does not automatically confer\nwisdom nor does having a variety of\nexperiences many people pass through\ntheir lives more or less on autopilot\ntheir various experiences don't register\nany more deeply than a factual memory\nby the same token simply experiencing\npain is generally not sufficient to\ngenerate wisdom either\nhere's why everyone experiences pain\nmost people have an incorrect attitude\ntowards it pain is the gift that nobody\nwants pain is your greatest teacher in\nlife\npain is the universe giving you feedback\nthat you need to pay attention to a\nparticular aspect of your life because\npain is a signal that your model of\nreality is incorrect\nand pain is your opportunity to bring\nthat model into closer Conformity with\nthe way things really are if you can\nalter your relationship with pain you\nwill accelerate your self-development\n100 fold\nso what prevents people from using the\nopportunity inherent in pain well there\nare many potential obstructions but\nthree principal ones\nthe first principle obstruction is that\nsome people are so stubborn or arrogant\nor ideologically possessed that they\ndouble down on their incorrect version\nof reality they continue to believe that\ntheir right despite their pain they hold\non to the belief that the way they think\nthings should be is how reality should\nin fact operate they chide reality for\ndeviating from their models rather than\nhold their models accountable for\ndeviating from reality\npain is reality chiding you from having\na deviant model do you understand so\narrogance and ideological possession can\nprevent people from entering into this\nopportunity\nthe second principle obstruction is that\nsome people just see pain as something\nto bear\nnow there is a time and a place to grit\nyour teeth and carry your cross and\ntolerate the pain of existence\nbut if you simply tolerate pain if you\nsimply bear it then you might not\ncultivate any curiosity about why you\nmay be in pain to begin with you just\nkind of think of it as a burden you need\nto carry for as long as you have to and\nso the pain is sort of a wasted\nopportunity\nwhat I've discovered is that a great\ndeal of the pain that exists on this\nplanet is due to the fact that people\ndon't know why they're in pain\nthere is a saying that ignorance is\nbliss no it's not a crying baby is not\nBlissful most people are suffering\nbecause like the infant they don't know\nwhy they're suffering if they knew why\nthey were suffering Not only would they\nquickly and significantly reduce their\nsuffering but they could also\npotentially generate meaning and\ncultivate wisdom as well\nand the third principle obstruction is\nthat many people just simply try to\navoid the pain entirely this is of\ncourse understandable pain is an\nunpleasant or even an excruciating\nemotion\nthe issue is that when people try to\navoid the pain either with drugs and\nalcohol or with hedonic pleasure or with\nsocial media in video games or with sex\nand excitement or with money and career\nall of these are forms of anesthesia\noffered by your culture\npeople also avoid the lesson inherent in\nthe pain and the thing about anesthesia\nis that it doesn't eliminate suffering\njust like in a surgery even if you're\nanesthetized your body still suffers\nyour body is still traumatized\nanesthesia doesn't really make the pain\ngo away it just sort of cuts your\nConsciousness off from your actual\nembodied experience\nwhich is actually kind of crazy making\nand that's why people who anesthetize\nthemselves for years tend to go a little\nnutty\nthey've cut themselves off from their\nembodied experience for so long if they\nwere to remove the anesthesia Not only\nwould they have to deal with the flood\nof accumulated pain which could be\noverwhelming but what they'd have to\ndeal with the fact that they haven't\nlearned how to trust let alone make\nsense of their embodied experience\nand if you can't trust your own\nexperience what can you trust\nAuthority science\nreligion\nnothing\nI wonder what the world would look like\nif billions of people couldn't trust\ntheir own common sense\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nyou can also hit the thanks button it's\njust underneath the video that you're\nwatching and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've derived from this\nmessage because it's support from people\nlike you that make all this happen I\ncouldn't do it without you and I really\nappreciate your support thank you\nso\nwhat's the alternative\nI'd like you to consider that pain is an\nopportunity to cultivate wisdom\nwhy because pain is essentially feedback\nfrom the universe that your mental model\nis not in line with reality it's\ninformation that you're bumping up\nagainst something that you're straying\nfrom the truth that you don't quite\nunderstand things perfectly yet pain is\npainful by Design in order to attract\nyour attention and that attention should\nstimulate curiosity why am I in pain\nwhat decisions did I make that preceded\nthis experience of suffering what were\nthe cognitive emotional and behavioral\nantecedents that led me to this point in\nmy life this curiosity should look very\nclosely and without Judgment at the\nvarious factors that led to the\nexperience of pain\nthis is the opportunity to generate\nInsight like the practice of looking at\nyourself closely and without judgment is\ninsight and the more you practice\nInsight the more insightful you get and\nwith Insight comes a host of good things\nonce you clarify the chain of events\nthat led to the experience of pain not\nonly should that understanding reduce\nyour experience of suffering now but it\nshould allow you to make better\ndecisions to avoid unnecessary suffering\nin the future\nfurthermore you can kind of operate\nunder the assumption that you're not all\nthat different from every other person\non the planet and so through careful\nobservation of your own experience you\ncan kind of reverse engineer every other\nperson on the planet you may not be able\nto get it exactly right but with\nsufficient practice you'll be able to\nget pretty close\nand this is really important because For\nBetter or For Worse other people are a\nblack box to us even if we were to cut\nthem open we wouldn't really find\nanything of use to us there you know\nwhat I'm saying the experience of their\nthoughts emotions and Consciousness is\nirreducibly inaccessible to us we can't\never truly know the inner workings of\nanother person but we can potentially\nknow our own inner workings very clearly\nand very deeply and this self-knowledge\nis the most reliable Pathway to other\nknowledge as well as to empathy kindness\nand compassion that I'm aware of\nthe self-knowledge born of accurate\nInsight allows for better relationships\nand a higher degree of Effectiveness\nwhatever your goals happen to be this is\nbecause accurate Insight should lead to\na reduction in pain which is a sign that\nyour mental models are increasingly\ncoming into alignment with reality\nthis allows you to act with effortless\nEffectiveness which is the most reliable\nsignal of wisdom that I am aware of it's\na kind of Life mastery\nthe seed of wisdom is curiosity about\nyour pain and it is cultivated through\nthe increasingly masterful application\nof insight\nand this process can be accelerated by\nswallowing your pride this is because\nthe assumptions required for curiosity\nmay be my model of reality is incorrect\nmaybe I've contributed to my own\nsuffering maybe I don't know what I\ndon't know all of these assumptions\nrequire a lot of humility the humility\nto admit at least to yourself that you\ndon't know everything\nand that you're not perfect and that\nsome people might even know more than\nyou or might be a little further along\nthe path than you\nthese people needn't be threats they\ncould be mentors\nthey could be like big brothers or Big\nSisters folks who well certainly\nimperfect might be a little further down\nthe road\nand so you see when people ask me how I\nknow the things I know I usually respond\nbecause of pain\nI've been in a lot of pain and in a lot\nof different flavors of pain and my own\nselfish desire to escape that pain has\nled me over the years to cultivate\ninsight to a very refined degree which\nmay have produced some degree of wisdom\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel it may\nalso be consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like the priority\nreview of comments or booking a
