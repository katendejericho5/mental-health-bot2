    "transcript": "as Jesus said only in his hometown among\nhis relatives and in his own house is a\nprophet without honor this quote from\nJesus also suggests that the same\nProphet might be honored outside of\nthese circles the good that you do is\ngenerally recognized by people outside\nof your immediate family and friend\ngroup where that recognition will not be\nexperienced as personally threatening as\na narcissistic injury and this is why\nyour biggest fan is probably someone you\nhaven't met yet the last place in the\nworld that may celebrate what good you\nbring is where you came from the tragedy\nhere is that just because when people\nstart to stand up they are not\nrecognized and supported or even that\nthey are chastised and censured by the\n10 or 20 people closest to them these\npeople believe that there's nothing\nparticularly special about them or that\nthey don't have anything of value to\ngive and it may be that their value may\nbe ignored or discounted because it is\nthreatening to the other people's\negocentrism or their vanity"
