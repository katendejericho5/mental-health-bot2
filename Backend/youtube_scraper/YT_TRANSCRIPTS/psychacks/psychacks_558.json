    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today short talk is how to deal\nwith haters\nso as soon as you make the decision to\nstand up and stop hiding and to show the\nworld who you are and what you believe\nyou will start to cast a shadow one of\nthe costs associated with becoming\nsomebody is that you will attract\nopposition\nthis is because in this world of Duality\neverything under the sun has an\nantithetical element\nno matter how good and right and correct\nyou believe yourself to be there will be\npeople who disagree with you and\ndepending on their own level of\nawareness these people may attempt to\ncriticize denounce ostracize and destroy\nyou\nand the brightest lights throughout\nhistory have often been fringed with the\nmost profound darknesses\nso if you dare to stand up you will cast\na shadow it's unavoidable and once you\ndo you will attract haters\nhaters are people who are loudly\nnegative with respect to who they think\nyou are and to what they believe you\nbelieve\nnow I say it like this because in my own\nexperience haters almost never carry an\naccurate conceptualization in their\nminds of your arguments and beliefs\nthese conceptualizations are typically\nwarped straw man substitutes for your\nactual beliefs maintained through\nselective attention to evidence that\nsupports their Distortion and selective\ninattention to evidence that disconfirms\nit they rarely possess a measured and\ncomprehensive understanding of your\nposition\nand they also seem very personally\ninvested in proving that you're wrong\ngenerally this is because your very\nexistence as someone who has stood up is\nitself the shadow of someone who has\nremained in hiding\nyou represent parts of themselves that\nfor whatever reason they have not\nallowed themselves to accept and\nintegrate\nthese parts are denied\ndisavowed and projected into others\nhaters then try to purify themselves by\npurging the world of the darkness they\nhave projected into others\nof course this never works and it\ncreates an incomprehensible amount of\nunnecessary suffering\nbut this is why it happens\nthere's a quote from David Goggins that\nbears repeating here you will never meet\na hater doing better than you\nyep that's right and to understand why\nthat's right we have to understand that\nhater\nis actually something of a misnomer\nhating isn't so much about hate as it is\nabout Envy\nand envy is a really complicated and\nInsidious emotion to experience Envy a\nperson must perceive a deficit relative\nto a perceived self-relevant good with\nrespect to a perceived equal that was\ncomplicated so I'll say it again to\nexperience Envy a person must perceive a\ndeficit with respect to a perceived\nself-relevant good relative to a\nperceived equal there's a lot of\nperception going on here which kind of\nmakes sense because Envy is really in\nhow you choose to look at things\nand you need all of those elements to\nKindle this emotion\nthere's a lot to unpack here but the\ncomponent I want to draw your attention\nto here is the final bit Envy can only\nexist relative to a perceived equal you\ntake away that part and you don't have\nEnvy anymore you have admiration\nbut if you believe that a perceived\nequal someone who you believe really\nshouldn't be doing all that much better\nthan you has much more of something you\nwant than you do especially if that\nsomething is related to your identity\nyou're going to feel Envy now you can\ncontrol what you do with that feeling\nbut on some level you won't be able to\nnot experience it if all the conditions\nare met\nthe greater the perceived equality the\neasier it is for nv2 fluoresce and this\nis why this is going to be tough but\nit's true this is why your biggest hater\nis someone that you know\nsomeone who is probably very close to\nyou\nbecause of the perceived equality\nCriterion the greatest potential for\nEnvy always exists among peer-aged\nfriends and siblings\nEnvy is why Cain killed Abel\nif Abel weren't Cain's brother God's\npreference the self-relevant good for\nAbel's sacrifice wouldn't have hurt\nquite so much after all Abel was just\nKane's brother\nand just Kane's little brother at that\nso there was nothing in Cain's\nconceptualization of Abel to justify\nGod's preference\nEnvy is more prevalent in families and\namong peers because in those circles\nyou're not only just a friend or just a\nbrother or just a spouse\nbut you're just my friend and just my\nbrother or just my spouse\nyou're not special\nyou're potentially just someone who\nexists relative to me\nas Jesus said only in his hometown among\nhis relatives and in his own house is a\nprophet without honor\nEnvy is the reason why\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton it's the three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message your support\nis what makes all this happen I couldn't\ndo it without you and I really\nappreciate it thank you\nnow this quote from Jesus also suggests\nthat the same Prophet might be honored\noutside of these circles the good that\nyou do is generally recognized by people\noutside of your immediate family and\nfriend group where that recognition will\nnot be experienced as personally\nthreatening as a narcissistic injury\nand this is why your biggest fan is\nprobably someone you haven't met yet and\nwhy you should take the risk to stand up\nso that these people can recognize you\nfrom afar\nbe huge in Japan as the saying goes\nbecause the last place in the world that\nmay celebrate what good you bring is\nwhere you came from\ntragedy here is that just because when\npeople start to stand up they are not\nrecognized and supported or even that\nthey are chastised and censured by the\n10 or 20 people closest to them\nthese people believe that there's\nnothing particularly special about them\nor that they don't have anything of\nvalue to give and that may not be true\nit may be that their value may be\nignored or discounted because it is\nthreatening to the other people's\negocentrism or their vanity\nfor this reason I strongly recommend\nsetting your sights outside the little\ncircles you entered by accident the\naccident of birth the accident of being\nassigned the same homeroom the accident\nof working two desks down\nput your value out into the world and\nattract the people who really resonate\nwith what you're about that's your real\nCommunity the people who resonate on the\nsame frequency as you and in my\nexperience this only happens to be the\npeople immediately surrounding You by\nsome sheer miracle\nso what's the best way to deal with\nhaters in general the best response to\nhaters is no response this is because\nengagement whether it's Defending Your\nPosition or debating your criticism or\ntheir criticism or responding in kind is\ngenerally reinforcing it's like with\nchildren for whom negative attention is\nbetter than no attention at all and some\nchildren will act up and get into\ntrouble because they prefer that to\nbeing ignored so the best response is no\nresponse on the other hand if you are\nsomehow required to respond the second\nbest response is a non-reinforcing\nresponse this is as close to a truly\nneutral response as you can muster no\nexpression no emotion\na non-reinforcing response suggests that\nthere is nothing in the hater's\ncommunication that made enough sense to\neven perceive it as a communication\nrequiring a response it's almost like\nthe hater made sounds that I couldn't\nquite make out his words\nso I can't really respond one way or the\nother\nit kind of doesn't accept that\ncommunication even occurred like I\ndiscussed in a previous episode we\ntransform an object into a weapon when\nwe communicate that we've been hurt by\nits application\nwe communic by communicating a\nnon-reinforcing response you disarm the\nhater by responding in a way that\nexpresses that no harm was experienced\nmost haters won't try that tactic again\nas it was apparently unable to achieve\nthe desired result\nso that's how you deal with haters and\nif you've recognized Envy in yourself\nand would like to divest yourself of\nthat emotion great check out my episode\non how to dismantle envy that might be\nhelpful to you\nwhat do you
