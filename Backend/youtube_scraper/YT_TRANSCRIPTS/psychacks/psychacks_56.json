    "transcript": "in today's sexual Marketplace men and\nwomen are engaged in a kind of Mexican\nstandoff in which neither one wants to\nput their gun down first women today\nlook at men and they're just kind of\ndisappointed they think there are no\ngood men anymore and the men who do\nengage with them they just seem to want\nsex without commitment from their\nperspective this would mean settling for\na lot less than they think they're worth\nsince they believe that dealing with\nsuch men would be at a perceived loss\nthey would rather just remain single and\nwait until they meet a man who will give\nthem more of what they want by the same\ntoken men today look at women and\nthey're just sort of bewildered they\nthink there are no good women anymore\nand the women who do engage with them\njust seem to want the moon they're\ndemanding and entitled and delusional\nthey seem to want so much and offer so\nlittle in return from their perspective\nthis would mean paying a lot more than\nthey think they should since they\nbelieve that dealing with such women\nwould be a perceived loss they would\nrather just remain single and wait until\nthey meet a woman who will give them\nmore of what they want"
