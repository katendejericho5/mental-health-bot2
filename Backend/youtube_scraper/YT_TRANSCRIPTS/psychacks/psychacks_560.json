    "transcript": "one thing that I routinely advise men to\ndo is to clarify their intentions with\nrespect to a given woman before they\ninteract with her this generally\nimproves Effectiveness regardless of\ntheir specific Intentions by increasing\ncongruence across the various levels of\ncommunication and this also helps to\ndefine the line of acceptable loss the\nmore casual the intention the more\ncheaply the acceptable loss is\ncalculated for instance even the\nsmallest cost or the least amount of\nrisk would likely not justify an\nundesirable sexual activity however a\nmore meaningful or desirable goal would\nalso likely inspire a dearer loss\nestimation"
