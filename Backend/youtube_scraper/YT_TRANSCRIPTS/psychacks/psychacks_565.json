    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women and\nacceptable loss\nall right by now we should all be duly\nfamiliar with the concept of hypergamy\nin short hypergamy is the tendency in\nwomen to mate and date up in status\nhierarchies for instance women generally\nwant men who are older taller stronger\nhigher status higher earning Etc\nwe've also talked about how women treat\nmen the way men treat jobs this means\nthat all things being equal women are\ngoing to choose their most compelling\noverall offer and this also means that\nwomen mate or date for gain they want\nsomething better than they currently\nhave that's the hyper part of hypergamy\nSimply breaking even is generally not\nsufficient incentive for a woman to\ninitiate a sexual relationship\nirrespective of whether it's something\ncasual or something more long-term women\nmust benefit from the interaction in\norder to justify the risk and the\nopportunity cost of pursuing that\nparticular relationship so far so good\nnow let's look at it from the other side\nif what I've said is true if it's true\nthat women mate and date for gain then\nmen mate and date for acceptable loss\nI'll say that again if it's true that\nwomen mate and date for gain then men\nmate and date for acceptable loss to the\nextent that the woman is successful in\nsecuring a relationship with a higher\nstatus man who can improve her situation\nthen that man secures the same\nrelationship at some degree of loss to\nhim in the vast majority of cases in\nterms of time energy money commitment\nand opportunity most women will consume\nmore value than they provide and of\ncourse that's why they're there\nbecause it's a net positive for them and\ngood on you women\nI I'd improve my situation by securing a\nrelationship with a higher status woman\nif I could as well so I don't blame you\nat all that said while the statement\nwomen mate and date for gain sounds\nreasonable enough the statement women\nconsume more value than they provide\ntends to melt some faces even though\nit's exactly the same statement like it\nliterally wouldn't be possible for women\nto mate and date for gain if they didn't\nconsume more than they provided if they\nprovided more than they consumed then\nthey would be mating and dating at a\nloss which is an unlikely or at least an\nunsustainable situation\nand the objection that men and women\nprovide each other value equally is an\nattempt to mystify the reality of the\nsituation\nthose with less generally call for\nequality the loudest because an equal\nsplit would improve their situation\nhowever in relationships inequality is\nthe rule and equality is not always\nJustified I'm not saying this is either\ngood or bad it's just the way it is\nin any case men if you're looking to\nenter into a relationship with a woman\nyou need to make peace with the fact\nthat you will incur some loss in the\ntransaction however there is an enormous\ndifference between acceptable loss and\nunacceptable loss and it's for every man\nto determine for himself where the line\nbetween the two lines it's often not a\nhard and fast line most of us would\nlikely agree that there are Arrangements\nthat are very clearly acceptable losses\nand Arrangements that are very clearly\nunacceptable losses but there's\ndefinitely a lot of Gray Zone in the\nmiddle\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton it's the three little dots in the\nlow right hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this episode it's support\nfrom you that makes this all happen and\nI couldn't do it without you so thank\nyou very much\nnow to understand how to go about doing\nthis men do you understand where to draw\nthe line of acceptable loss I'd like you\nto imagine that your generals trying to\nwin a war\nif you wanted to win a war without any\none of your soldiers dying you would not\nbe able to do so it would be impossible\nyou'd be far too conservative and\ncautious and that pattern would be\nquickly exploited by your adversary\nVictory would just not be possible on\nthe other hand no General in good\nconscience would throw a man's life away\ncallously it's no small thing to order a\nbattalion into a skirmish with a low\nchance of survival because of the\nStrategic Advantage it affords however\nthese sacrifices are almost always\nnecessary to secure the ultimate goal\nwhich in this case is to win the war\nthere is a measure of acceptable loss\ngenerals must tolerate in the pursuit of\ntheir goal and there is a measure of\nunacceptable loss that generals must\navoid if their Victory is to be\nmeaningful\nif all their soldiers were destroyed in\nthe process there would be no one left\nto enjoy the victory this is\nunacceptable and this is why the Advent\nof nuclear weapons have more or less led\nto a stalemate so far in terms of world\nconflict no one wants to rule over a\npile of Ashes\nso somewhere between I can't lose a\nsingle man and I'm prepared to sacrifice\nmy entire Army is the line between\nacceptable and unacceptable loss\nso what does this have to do with women\nwell just like the generals men need to\napproach mating and dating through the\nlens of some overarching purpose if the\ngenerals weren't fighting for something\nthey believed in then even the smallest\nsacrifice might not be worth the price\nof victory\nand there are things that you can do\nwith a woman that justify acceptable\nlosses Chief among them is starting a\nfamily and creating a legacy for\nyourself and there are others that\ndepend on an individual's goals and\ninclinations\nhowever without such an overarching\npurpose then even the smallest cost\nmight not be worth securing the\nrelationship the Jews generally isn't\nworth the squeeze without it\none thing that I routinely advise men to\ndo is to clarify their intentions with\nrespect to a given woman before they\ninteract with her\nthis generally improves Effectiveness\nregardless of their specific Intentions\nby increasing congruence across the\nvarious levels of communication\nand this also helps to define the line\nof acceptable loss\nthe more casual the intention the more\ncheaply the acceptable loss is\ncalculated for instance even the\nsmallest cost or the least amount of\nrisk would nikely would likely not\njustify an undesirable sexual activity\nhowever a more meaningful or desirable\ngoal would also likely inspire a dearer\nloss estimation\nand it's important to emphasize that\nit's not for anyone else not for me not\nyour women not your culture to tell you\nwhat you should consider a meaningful or\ndesirable goal this is for you to decide\nfor yourselves\nI understand a lot of men's reticence\nabout entering into relationships with\nwomen\nsince women mate and date for gain men\nmust typically resign themselves to some\nmeasure of loss the inescapable reality\nhere is that all men pay\nand while it's true that the more a\ngiven woman likes you the greater the\ndiscount it's also true that the more\nmeaningful or desirable the opportunity\nthe more the cost is Justified like a\ngood General you just have to learn how\nto choose your battles\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso
