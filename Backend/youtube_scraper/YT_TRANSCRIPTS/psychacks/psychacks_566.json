    "transcript": "I would encourage women to think of\nthemselves as Savvy investors they may\nnot always get it right but the good\nones generally do very well for\nthemselves just like in the marketplace\nyou ideally want to buy low and sell\nHigh the same works for relationships\nwhich is why nearly every female\nbillionaire is either an heiress or a\ndivorcee if you want Equity especially\nEquity at parity you've got to take the\nrisk roll up your sleeves and work just\nas hard as the man when he has nothing\nand if you're not willing to do that if\nyou want to wait until the work is done\nand the race is run you'll need to\ncontent yourself with a salary at best"
