    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic for today's short talk is only\nFounders get equity this one is for the\nladies gentlemen feel free to send this\non to your sisters and daughters I'm\nhere to help now in the business World\ninvesting in an untried company is an\ninherently risky Endeavor pouring time\nenergy and money into a project with an\nuncertain or even a low chance of\nsuccess is not something to be done\nlightly or with casual indifference many\nof these companies have nothing to show\nfor themselves yet or even money with\nwhich to pay their workers so the way\nthese companies attract investors and\ntalent is with Equity the promise of a\nportion of the company's eventual\nsuccess if and when it goes public\nEquity is how people after several years\nbecome multi-millionaires overnight\nbet on the right Pony and that initial\ninvestment or that year or two of effort\ncan come back ten thousand fold and on\nsome level that's fair\nthese people took a significant risk\nthey deferred their gratification and\nwould have been left with nothing if the\ncompany hadn't panned out in my opinion\nthey deserve their jackpot they are\nsubstantially compensated for their\nsubstantial risk and any company that is\njust starting out will attempt to lure\nits potential investors and\ncollaborators its founders with a vision\nof the future and a promised slice of\nthe pie high risk but High reward\nnow many folks are going to turn down\nthis offer as too risky instead they're\ngoing to wait to see what happens maybe\nthe company goes to the moon but maybe\nor probably it's going to fail if it\nfails bullet dodged and if it succeeds\nwell they could always apply for a\nposition if and when the company gets\nthrough with its Growing Pains but\nhere's the thing\nif you the potential employee wait to\nseek a position at a company only after\nit's been successfully established\nyou're not going to get equity\nyou're going to get a salary at best\nnow this might be a good salary I mean a\nlot of companies where I live offer\ntheir employees six figure salaries but\nit is a salary nonetheless you're likely\nnever going to become a\nmulti-millionaire and you will need to\nwork 40 hours or more for the rest of\nyour career you might do very well for\nyourself but it's a very different\nsituation to be an employee and a\nsuccessful company than to be a Founder\nat a successful startup\nthis same thing holds true with\nlong-term relationships I'll speak from\nmy own experience\nlet me tell you when I was in my early\n20s boy oh boy\nwas I interested in getting married and\nwhy was I so keen on getting hitched\nback then\nbecause I sure could have used the help\nI was broke I was living in subsidized\nhousing in Brooklyn the place was\nfurnished with stuff that I found on the\nstreets I didn't know how to cook my\nplace was filthy and I had no real\nprospects I had nothing to offer but\nmyself which I learned doesn't get you\nvery much in the sexual Marketplace\nnow here's the thing even back then I\nknew who I was and I had a vision for\nthe future\nI knew what I was capable of and I\nbelieved in myself even when no one else\ndid I believed in myself and I had\nabsolute confidence in my ability to\nachieve my vision\nand I would pitch that to the women that\nI dated this is what we could build\ntogether I could really use your help\nunfortunately my vision was just not a\nsufficiently attractive offer to the\nwomen in question and this was painful\nat the time but I totally get it now\nafter all most startups fail\nthere are a lot of guys with ambition\nand potential who never end up realizing\ntheir dream\nI get it it's always riskier to bet on a\nhorse before the race is run\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the thanks\nbutton it's the three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message\nit's support like this that makes all of\nthis happen and I really appreciate it\nthank you very much\nso in my case what happened well since I\ncouldn't find a Helper and since I\nwasn't ready to give up on my dream I\nhad to roll up my sleeves and do it\nmyself\nand back then I didn't really know\nanything about anything and it turns out\nto use my analogy it's actually\nextremely complicated to launch a\nsuccessful business for instance you\nneed to know about marketing and I\ndidn't know anything about marketing so\nI would have loved to bring on a woman\nwho could do that but I couldn't find\none even though I offered equity\nso I learned marketing myself\nyou also need to know about accounting\nand I didn't know anything about\naccounting so I would have loved to\nbring a woman on for that but I couldn't\nfind one to do that either even though I\noffered Equity so I learned about\naccounting myself and so forth and so on\nbecause I wasn't successful in\nattracting a woman for a long-term\npartnership with the prospect of equity\nin a future successful relationship I\nfunctionally hired myself for all of\nthose roles\nnowadays I'm the CEO\nand the CTO\nand the CEO and the head of HR and the\nchef who caters the meetings hell at\nthis point I'm the chief diversity\nofficer\ndo you understand I'm everything because\nI've had to be and now that my company\nis fairly successful now that I bring in\na significant amount of Revenue now that\nI have some clout and status and market\nshare now that I don't need to hire\nanyone because I've learned to do\neverything myself\nguess what the resumes are just pouring\nin\nand this is just tragic because really I\nwould have been so grateful if I could\nhave gotten a woman's help when I first\nstarted out it would have made things so\nmuch easier I could have gotten here\nsooner and it would have made a huge\ndifference in my life but that's not how\nthings played out\nwomen who are generally more risk averse\nthan men saw investing in me back then\nas too risky of a proposition and it's\nlike fair enough\nbut here's the thing I don't really need\nto hire now and if I did they wouldn't\nget equity\nthey would get a salary\nafter all of my trials and all of my\nefforts over the last two decades there\nis absolutely no way I would ever enter\ninto an arrangement in which someone I\ntook on might be entitled to half of\nwhat I've built it's like completely out\nof the question like where were you 20\nyears ago you weren't involved in the\nsubstantial risk so why would you be\nentitled to a substantial reward ladies\nif you wait until the company goes\npublic you don't get Equity you get a\nsalary\nnow the salary I offer is very\ncompetitive you would be hard-pressed to\nfind a better compensation package\nelsewhere but it's a position that will\nrequire effort it's not a ticket to an\nearly retirement\nladies this is the takeaway\nnearly all the successful high-value\nguys that women are gunning for today\nweren't always successful and high value\nif women were really smart they would\nget better at exercising their\ndiscernment with respect to which\nambitious talented men are likely to go\nthe distance\nthis is why I say that the best dating\nstrategy for women is to find a dark\nhorse I would encourage women to think\nof themselves as Savvy investors they\nmay not always get it right but the good\nones generally do very well for\nthemselves just like in the marketplace\nyou ideally want to buy low and sell\nHigh\nthe same works for relationships which\nis why nearly every female billionaire\nis either an heiress or a divorcee\nif you want Equity especially Equity at\nparity you've got to take the risk roll\nup your sleeves and work just as hard as\nthe man when he has nothing\nand if you're not willing to do that if\nyou want to wait until the work is done\nand the race is run you'll need to\ncontent yourself with a salary at best\nI hope that makes sense\nwhat do you think\nplease let me know in the comments below\nand if you've gotten
