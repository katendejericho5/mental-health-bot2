    "transcript": "I think we gotta be careful about\nromanticizing the days when people got\nmarried at 17 and stayed together for 70\nyears personally I'd rather not go back\nto that time with its lack of\noptionality or recourse I like being\nable to choose an option that's right\nfor me as opposed to having to settle\nfor the only thing available that said\nthis optionality is also a driver in the\npresent decline in relationships with\ndating apps and social media many people\nare ensnared by the illusion of infinite\noptionality and this illusion has\nexacerbated the Primacy of desire in the\nmodern game of mating and dating even\nmore than the elimination of necessity\nby itself ever could why because if I\ndon't need someone and very desirable\nPartners exist somewhere in that\ninfinite optionality then I have little\nincentive to settle for anything less\nthan something very desirable and why\nshouldn't I have it all I don't need to\nsettle for less I'm young and I have\nplenty of time anyway"
