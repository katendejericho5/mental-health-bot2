    "transcript": "women and men don't need each other\nanymore I don't mean this on the\npopulation level like Civilization would\nfall apart without a lot of men and\nHumanity would go extinct without a lot\nof women men need women around and women\nneed men around but perhaps for the\nfirst time in a very long time modern\nman doesn't need a woman and modern\nwoman doesn't need amen and I think this\nis a really important driver of the\nunprecedented decline in marriage dating\nand sexual relationships that we're\nexperiencing at the present moment we no\nlonger need each other at least we no\nlonger need each other the way that most\nof us did even a hundred years ago"
