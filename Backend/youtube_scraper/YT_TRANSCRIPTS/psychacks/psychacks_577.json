    "video_title": "The GAME changes SIGNIFICANTLY at 30",
    "transcript": "a lot of women prioritize other things\nin life and they assume that they'll\njust be able to have a family when\nthey're ready and then they get to their\nmid or late 30s and they realize that\nit's actually much more difficult to\nattract a man for marriage and kids now\nthan it would have been in their early\nor mid-20s the game changes\nsignificantly at 30 and men are expected\nto make the same offer which typically\nbecomes more expensive as a function of\ntime and that's why 80 percent of women\nwho ultimately end up childless arrive\nthere unintentionally in my opinion it's\na better strategy to secure partners and\nchildren in their 20s when their smv is\nhigh and it's biologically advantageous\nto do so and devote the 30s to career\nand development once the kids are in\nschool one of the reasons for this is\nthat there is not really a point at\nwhich women can stop making money or\ntraveling we're spending time with their\nfriends but there is absolutely a point\nat which women can stop having children"
