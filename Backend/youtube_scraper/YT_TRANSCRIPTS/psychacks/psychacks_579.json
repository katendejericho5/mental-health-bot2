    "transcript": "just to be clear I'm not suggesting that\nwomen don't experience a pressured\nurgency to have children as they near\nthe end of their reproductive Windows\nespecially if they haven't yet had\nchildren I believe that that exists what\nI'm suggesting is that it's a misnomer\nto call this a biological clock it's\nprobably truer to call it a\npsychological clock in my opinion this\npressured sense of urgency is really\nrelated to the fear of missing out it's\na psychological recognition that an\nexperience that they haven't yet had\nmight be lost to them forever"
