    "transcript": "women do have a biological clock\nassociated with reproduction but it's\nnot on the scale of a lifetime it's on\nthe scale of a month what we know is\nthat women are much more interested in\nsex that they are more likely not just\nto initiate but initiate riskier sexual\ninteractions like the ones more likely\nto result in pregnancy when they're\novulating and this makes sense from a\nbiological perspective this biological\nclock motivates women to seek out sex\nduring the monthly window when they're\nmost likely to get pregnant and riskier\ndoesn't just mean sex without protection\nResearch indicates for example that\nmarried women are much more likely to\ncheat when they're ovulating especially\nwhen their committed partners are less\nattractive"
