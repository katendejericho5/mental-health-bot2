    "video_title": "This is why 30 is a CRUCIAL age",
    "transcript": "as previously discussed 30 is the age at\nwhich the average male sexual\nMarketplace value exceeds the average\nwoman's sexual Marketplace value for the\nvery first time and since men are\npresumably expected to make the same\nultimate offer namely marriage or a\nlifetime of commitment protection and\nprovision to a woman in her 20s as to a\nwoman in her 30s or Beyond and since\nwomen's sexual Marketplace value\ndecreases across the same timeline all\nother things being equal the same offer\nbecomes increasingly expensive as the\nwoman ages I'll say that again in a\nslightly different way since the offer\nis the same but a woman's sexual\nMarketplace value decreases as she ages\nthe same offer becomes increasingly\nexpensive as a function of time"
