    "transcript": "as discussed previously across all\ncultures and throughout history the man\nhas been expected to proposition the\nwoman this proposition can range from\nyou up to can I buy you a drink sometime\nto will you marry me but it is always\nthe man who makes the offer to the woman\nand this is peculiar because there\ndoesn't seem to be like a necessary\nreason for this like if we can\ncollectively question the necessity of\npretty much every other traditional\ngender role I'm not sure why this one\nhas survived to the present day and just\nfor the record I would love to be taken\nout to dinner like if you want to make\nall the plans and pay for everything or\nif you want to invite me over for a\nhome-cooked meal I would be thrilled to\nshow up and look pretty provided of\ncourse you are sufficiently attractive\nyou meet all of my criteria and you\ndon't assume I'm just gonna sleep with\nyou because that would be creepy and my\neyes are up here women don't seem\ninterested in occupying this\ntraditionally male role in the courtship\nprocess"
