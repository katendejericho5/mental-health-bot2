    "transcript": "Envy is a complicated emotion but one of\nits many preconditions is that it can\nonly arise in the context of perceived\nequals if you don't perceive yourself to\nbe someone's equal then his or her\nsuccess or superiority is experienced as\nadmiration however the more similar\npeople believe themselves to be the more\nlikely they will feel envious of\nanother's progress even if or rather\nespecially if it's a loved one the\nperson who isn't improving may also\nstart to feel as if he or she is holding\nthe other person back or that he or she\nis increasingly the problem in the\nrelationship this is a narcissistic\ninjury and it can throw all but those\nwith the strongest sense of self for a\nloop and let me tell you as hard as it\ncan be to be in a relationship with a\nproblematic person it's often easier to\ndeal with someone else's problem than to\nfeel as though you yourself are the\nproblem"
