    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the way\nit all ends\nso this is a long one but it's an\nimportant one it's also one for the\nladies so guys forward this on to your\nsisters and daughters they need to hear\nthis\nall right let's start by taking a high\nlevel look at the state of the sexual\nMarketplace in the present day shall we\nfewer people are getting married\nentering into relationships or even\nhooking up than ever before all three of\nthese things are at historically\nunprecedented lows and there are many\nmany reasons for this however one of the\nprimary drivers of this phenomenon as\ndiscussed in the previous episode is\nfemale hypergamy\ncoupled with the reality that in the\nwest young women are doing very well\nchildless women under 30 are\noutperforming men in that demographic in\nalmost every quantifiable metric and\nmost notably in education and earning\nyay women\nthat said if women retain their tendency\nto mate and date up and if young men are\nunderperforming relative to young women\nthen there will simply be a smaller and\nsmaller pool from which most women would\nbe willing to select a partner and since\nwomen are The Gatekeepers of sex and Men\nAre The Gatekeepers of commitment and\nsince sex precedes commitment in the\nwest we see the trickle-down effect\nmentioned before less sex leads to fewer\nrelationships leads to fewer marriages\nnow this would actually be a much easier\nproblem to solve were it not for one\nlittle thing namely women despite all\ntheir modern ideas about gender sex and\npower are still waiting for the offer\nas discussed previously across all\ncultures and throughout history the man\nhas been expected to proposition the\nwoman\nthis proposition can range from you up\nto can I buy you a drink sometime to\nwill you marry me but it is always the\nman who makes the offer to the woman\nand this is peculiar because there\ndoesn't seem to be like a necessary\nreason for this like if we can\ncollectively question the necessity of\npretty much every other traditional\ngender role I'm not sure why this one\nhas survived to the present day and just\nfor the record I would love to be taken\nout to dinner like if you want to make\nall the plans and pay for everything or\nif you want to invite me over for a\nhome-cooked meal I would be thrilled to\nshow up and look pretty\nprovided of course you are sufficiently\nattractive you meet all of my criteria\nand you don't assume I'm just going to\nsleep with you because that would be\ncreepy and my eyes are up here\nin any case and for whatever reason\nwomen don't seem interested in occupying\nthis traditionally male role in the\ncourtship process at all ages and at all\nlevels of commitment they are still\nwaiting for the offer now on the surface\nthis doesn't seem to cause too many\nproblems for women in their 20s the\noffers might be coming in hard and fast\nand it may reasonably seem like it's\nonly a matter of time before an even\nbetter offer comes in and they'll accept\nwhen they're ready however this attitude\nwhile understandable leads to a number\nof Fairly predictable Downstream\nconsequences this is because the game\nchanges at 30.\npreviously discussed 30 is the age at\nwhich the average male sexual\nMarketplace value exceeds the average\nwoman's sexual Marketplace value for the\nvery first time\nand since men are presumably expected to\nmake the same ultimate offer namely\nmarriage or a lifetime of commitment\nprotection and provision to a woman in\nher 20s as to a woman in her 30s or\nBeyond\nand since women's sexual Marketplace\nvalue decreases across the same timeline\nall other things being equal the same\noffer becomes increasingly expensive as\nthe woman ages\nI'll say that again in a slightly\ndifferent way since the offer is the\nsame but a woman's sexual Marketplace\nvalue decreases as she ages the same\noffer becomes increasingly expensive as\na function of time\nwhat this generally means is that if\nwomen don't adapt to changing conditions\nthey may find themselves priced out of\nthe market especially since they seem\nhell-bent against making the offer this\nis why Mick Jagger crooned that time was\non his side\nyes it is\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button it's the three little dots\nin the lower right hand corner and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this message\nall of this is made possible through\nyour support and I couldn't do this\nwithout you so I'm really appreciative\nof what you can do thank you very much\nall right let's try to put this all\ntogether shall we given all the factors\nthat we've discussed thus far female\nhypergamy young women's success relative\nto young men changing smv as a function\nof time and the fact that women aren't\nmaking offers to men there are actually\nonly a few different ways this can\npossibly turn out in fact if we play the\nchess out 20 moves we see that there are\nonly five possible end games here for\nwomen\ncan't give the exact odd ratios but some\nare much more plausible than others\nlet's briefly walk through all five\nscenarios\nremember\nHigh performing attractive young women\nset an extremely high barrier to entry\ntheir success coupled with their\nhypergamy means that there are fewer\npotential mating and dating options for\nthem their price tags the value required\nto overcome their entry barriers to a\nsexual relationship are very very high\nand since the majority of women are\ngunning for the same top 10 percent of\nmen the intersexual competition is\nastounding\nnow on the other hand while women are\ndoing very well the men to whom they are\nhypergamously attracted are by\ndefinition doing even better\nthese 10 percent of men have incredible\noptionality and they may understandably\nbe reticent to forego the buffet for the\nsame meal for the rest of their lives\nthis creates the ironic Paradox that the\nmen who have what women want are the\nleast likely to give it to them\nlet me say that again the men who have\nwhat women want are the least likely to\ngive it to them from their perspective\nthe women's demands are too expensive\nand they only become more expensive as a\nfunction of time\nand this phenomenon will intensify as\nthe trends we've discussed continue\nwhat this means is that given the\nassumptions I've already mentioned there\nare only five end games for women as\nyou'll see they logically cover all\npossible outcomes here they are\na women keep their price tags High beat\nout the intersexual competition and\nsecure the high value man\nB women lower their price tags in order\nto beat out the intersexual competition\nand secure the high value man\nC women keep their price tags High fail\nto beat out the intersexual competition\nand settle for a lower value man\nD women lower their price tags still\nfail to beat out the intersexual\ncompetition and settle for a low value\nman\nand E women neither secure nor settle\nand end up unpartnered there are\nliterally no other ways for the game to\nend\nso which outcome is most likely\nfeel free to pause the episode and take\na guess\nnow since we're talking about behavioral\neconomics and the exchange of value the\neasiest way to approach an answer to\nthis question is to consider what you a\nwoman would do if you were shopping\nto that end would you ever ever buy the\nexact same product from one vendor if\nyou could get it more cheaply and easily\nsomewhere else\nof course not\nand that's why though this is going to\nbe hard for some women to appreciate the\nmost unlikely outcome by far\nis scenario a\nkeeping your price tag high with men who\nare Awash in optionality ain't gonna\nlead to a sale\nthat's it do you sometimes pay much more\nfor a product from one vendor even\nthough you could get a similar product\nmore cheaply and easily elsewhere\nyou do\nalmost every woman I know owns a\ndesigner bag which is a sack to hold\nthings\nyou don't need to spend thousands of\ndollars on a sack but you do need to\nspend thousands of dollars on a Versace\nsack now Versace can charge thousands of\ndollars for a sack because they have\ndemonstrated proof that women will pay\nthousands of dollars they can beat out\nall the other sacks they are the one\npercent of sacks and a woman needs to be\na one percent woman\nto have a Versace price tag By\ndefinition most women are not one\npercent women\nthey will lose to the intersexual\ncompetition for the top 10 percent of\nmen\nif they keep their price tags High\nthis is not because these men can't\nafford the price tag but because like\nyou they are not going to spend more\nthan they need to for the exact same\nproduct so scenario a is the least\nlikely it only happens about one percent\nof the time\nnext appreciate the fact that even if\nevery one of these top 10 percent of men\nwanted to get married and settle down\nand they definitely don't that would\nmean by definition a maximum of only 10\npercent of women could possibly end up\nwith one of these high value men and\nsince one percent of women end up in\nscenario a and since roughly one-third\nof the remaining men in this category by\na conservative estimation will be\nuninterested in settling down at any one\ntime this means that about six percent\nof women can possibly end up in scenario\nB making it the second least likely\noutcome\nand of course the cost of securing this\noutcome is women lowering their price\ntags women are you more likely to buy\nthe Versace sack at full retail or when\nit's on sale even if you could afford\nthe full retail wouldn't you be more\nmotivated to act by the discount\nof course you would because that's\nrational and if Versace wants to reach a\nclientele that would otherwise be priced\nout of its regular product that is\nexactly what Versace needs to do\nexcellent we've covered the first two\noptions and there are still 93 percent\nof women left unaccounted for where are\nthey going to go\nwell since we know that 25 percent of\nwomen are unmarried at 40. a figure\nthat's increased a whopping 25 in just\nthe last 10 years and seven percent of\nwomen end up in the first two categories\nthat means that about two-thirds of\nwomen will face endgames C and D\nand since my impression is that women\nreproductive window notwithstanding\nwould genuinely and understandably\nprefer to remain unpartnered than resign\nthemselves to a less desirable\nrelationship with a lower value man I\ndon't think there's an equal split here\nthat said the desire for children and\ncommitment can be very powerful in women\nespecially as they age so there is a\nsplit to be made\nmy hunch is that about 15 percent of\nwomen end up in scenario D they lower\ntheir price tags still fail to beat out\nthe intersexual competition and settle\nfor a lower value man making it the\nthird least likely outcome\nand these women typically end up here\nout of pressure necessity\nwomen would you ever pay twenty dollars\nfor a mediocre sandwich probably if you\nwere at the airport and you didn't plan\nproperly\nin this scenario the prospect of going\n12 hours without food is more\ndistasteful than being gouged for a\ndisappointing meal you will be willing\nto pay more for less if the prospect of\ngoing entirely without is more painful\nseen from the opposite perspective this\nis why producers who create on a regular\nCadence everyone from car manufacturers\nto fashion designers to local bakeries\nradically discount their products right\nbefore the newer fresher products are\nreleased\nthis is designed to capture customers\nwho for whatever reason are unwilling or\nunable to wait just a little bit longer\nfor a better option hence pressured\nnecessity if you need the sale and your\nproduct is expiring this is how you\nmotivate action\nnow next up is scenario e\nthese are women who are unable to secure\nand unwilling to settle and they\nconstitute a rapidly growing proportion\nof the population as of right now about\none in Four Women will face this end\ngame and I think it will soon become one\nin three making it the second most\nlikely outcome\nit's too harsh to say that these women\nend up alone after all there are people\neverywhere with whom you can have\nsatisfying relationships but they end up\nunpartnered and childless\nin 2020 nearly 60 percent of women under\n30 in the U.S were childless and frankly\nthis doesn't seem to bother most women\nin this demographic many of them are\nthriving making good money traveling the\nworld prioritizing their friends and\ntheir interests and receiving lots of\noffers however as I can apparently never\nsay enough the game changes at 30. just\nlike a lot changes between the ages of\n19 and 29 A lot changes between the ages\nof 29 and 39.\nWindows shorten clocks wind down and the\nfear of missing out rears its ugly head\nfailing to plan is planning to fail\naccording to a 2010 meta-analysis only\n10 percent of ultimately childless women\nactively chose not to become mothers and\nabout 10 percent of the remaining women\ncould not become mothers due to medical\nreasons that means about 80 percent of\nwomen who never have children arrived at\nthis outcome unintentionally\nand this is not an even distribution\nacross all women the proportion of\nunintentionally childless women is\nsignificantly the highest among\nhigh-earning women\nwith Advanced degrees\nnamely\nwith the women who were performing so\nwell in their 20s\nmen are typically not as interested in\nmaking offers to these women not as is\ncommonly believed because they are\nintimidated by successful women that is\na cope for the women in question but\nbecause these successful women are older\nit takes time to get an advanced degree\nand build a career and as we've seen all\nother things being equal the same offer\nbecomes more expensive as a function of\ntime\nthese women are also the least likely to\nsurrender their hypergamous Tendencies\nafter all they've worked very hard to\nget to where they are so why would or\nshould they settle\nit's an excellent question however the\nupshot here is that these women tend to\nprice themselves out of the market more\nfrequently than their less educated\nlower earning and younger competition\nand that leaves scenario C since these\nfive end games cover all the mutually\nexclusive outcomes we can estimate that\n53 percent or roughly half of all women\nwill end up with lower value men willing\nto pay a higher price tag\nwhile a high value man with lots of\noptions may not be willing to offer say\nsexual exclusivity or a lifetime\ncommitment a lower value man who might\nnot be able to access the same sexual\nopportunity otherwise might\nthese men must offer more to compensate\nfor their lower attractiveness this\nmeans that most women end up with the\nrelationship they want but not with the\nman they would prefer\nand this is what leads to a lot of\nlow-grade marital dysfunction as Chris\nRock put it the number one reason why\nyour woman's always mad is because you\nain't her first choice\nlink below\nnot all women can afford a Versace sack\nbut that typically doesn't stop them\nfrom wanting one and this can make them\nenvious and unhappy especially if\nthey're scrolling\non the other hand some women can\nsuccessfully resolve this dissonance by\nmaking a virtue out of a necessity which\nall things being equal is actually a\nvery useful reframe that is rather than\nfocus on the sack they wanted but\ncouldn't afford they recast the knockoff\nthey bought at a significant discount as\njust as good after all the knockoff sack\ncan hold at least as much as the Versace\nsack and it may even be the more\npractical accessory for most occasions\nso what's the upshot at the end of the\nday most women will end up with a\nperfectly serviceable option so there's\nno need to give in to Panic or dread\nso this is the approximate distribution\nof endgame likelihood when we look 20\nmoves ahead and this distribution hinges\non women's continued reticence to make\nthe offer whether it's for a date or for\na lifetime of provision the game will\nchange significantly if and when they\ncross that threshold but this is how it\nroughly looks under the current state of\nplay\njust keep in mind that these are kind of\nIdeal odds ratios they skew more\ndisadvantageously to the women as the\nyears go by\nfor most women they will never have a\nbetter chance of securing the\nrelationship they want with the man they\nprefer\nthan today\nthis has been real talk with psychics\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar
