    "video_title": "The Japanese Samurai archetype",
    "transcript": "there are many models for masculinity\none of my personal favorites is one of\nthe Japanese Samurai I love archetype of\nthe Japanese Samurai because not only is\nhe strong and selfless and stoic and\nlong-suffering and resilient he also has\nenough sensitivity to be able to write a\nHaik coup about the cherry blossoms and\nto be moved by the beauty of the\ntransient seasons and on some level it's\nlike yeah that's that's correct it's\nlike why be so strong and tough if it\nmeans destroying the thing inside of you\nthat that strength and toughness was\ndesigned to protect which unfortunately\nis like the victim in so many men's\nlives is they they choke off or or\ncompletely repress that sensitivity that\nshould be defended and protected as much\nas like women and children on some level\nin traditional masculinity and by\ncutting that off you you cut off a great\ndeal of the richness and and joy in life\nand experience so I think I think that's\na really good model"
