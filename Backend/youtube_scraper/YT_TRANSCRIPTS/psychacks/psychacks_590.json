    "video_title": "How ALCOHOLISM leads to DYSFUNCTIONAL relationships",
    "transcript": "not so fun fact relationships in which\none partner is an alcoholic are more\nlikely to end not when the addict is in\nthe throes of his or her addiction but\nwhen this person sobers up and this is\npartly because the non-alcoholic partner\ncan no longer use the alcoholic as a\nscapegoat for all of the pain and\nsuffering and disappointment in his or\nher life the addiction gives the\nnon-addict the opportunity to feel\nmorally Superior and to externalize\nresponsibility for his or her suffering\nthat's why these people need to go to\nAl-Anon if the partner in question is of\na more co-dependent persuasion the\ndeterioration of one could be a project\nfor the other a source of purpose and\nmeaning in its more positive aspect this\ncan help bring people closer together\nhowever in its more Insidious\nmanifestations it can give rise to\nPerpetual victims so that Heroes can\nhave someone to save in any case my\npoint is that the deterioration of a\npartner is not devoid of potential\nbenefits"
