    "transcript": "ideally and this is especially true in\nthe early stages of the courtship\nprocess the woman should feel unsure\nabout how you feel about her this\ncreates the necessary conditions for\nfurther interaction to resolve that\nuncertainty like after you first sleep\nwith a woman she should pass through a\nmoment where she begins to wonder\nwhether that was just a one-night stand\nshe should think oh that's strange I\nusually hear from a man by now was he\njust using me for sex was that just a\nhookup I thought he liked me the date\nwent really well huh this is a good\nplace for a woman to be because it\ncreates the emotional motivation for her\nto come back to resolve her\nuncertainties and before I get any Flack\nfor this suggestion just consider that\nthe alternative is trying to get women\nto come back before they're ready to do\nso and we all know how well that goes"
