    "transcript": "let me talk about a distinct way in\nwhich men snatched defeat in the first\nweeks or months of dating remember when\nI described the reproach them all stage\nI noted that it's when the child hasn't\nseen mommy in a while that it starts to\nfeel anxious and insecure and it's these\nemotions that motivate the child to go\nback to make sure mommy is still there\nthe important thing to appreciate here\nis that if the child didn't feel anxious\nor insecure the child wouldn't go\nrunning back to Mommy so what does this\nmean with respect to the courtship\nprocess though it's weird to say the\nanxiety the uncertainty the instability\nthese things are your friends because\nit's these things like in the case of\nthe child that are going to motivate the\nwoman to return for her to come back she\nkind of has to miss you to wonder about\nyou and she can't miss you or wonder\nabout you if a who don't allow her the\ntime and space to miss you and B if you\ndon't allow her to wonder about you\nbecause you've already confessed your\nfeelings for her"
