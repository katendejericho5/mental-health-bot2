    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nmake friends as an adult\nso this is an extremely important skill\nthe ability to make friends and it gets\nharder to do as you age it's not always\neasy to make friends in high school and\ncollege but it will never be easier to\nmake friends than it is in high school\nand college and this is because you are\nmore or less forced to spend a great\ndeal of time with people your own age\nand you don't have a lot of other things\nto do or a lot of other responsibilities\nand so your free time defaults to your\ncohort and For Better or For Worse these\nfolks that you become friends with in\nhigh school or college tend to be your\nfoundational friends and you may stay\nfriends with them for the rest of your\nlives as they say you can't make new old\nfriends\nthe issue is not so much that these\nfriends have falling outs though that\ncan happen but that they slowly become\nless important as their lives diverge\nand this is particularly true for men\nmaintaining their friendships is\nsomething that women generally do better\nthan men not only because they seem to\nenjoy emotional connection for its own\nsake more than men do but because they\nkind of play 4D chess with their social\nrelationships as well like a woman will\ntake a girlfriend out to lunch because\nshe thinks that if she allows her to\nvent about her husband in two months\nshe'll be more likely to accept an\ninvitation to her baby shower something\nlike that women see how putting the time\nin now might come in handy later and\nthey enjoy spending time unless\ngoal-oriented contexts\ndon't get me wrong I'm not saying that\nmen don't value their friends the\nplatonic relationship between two male\nfriends might be one of the strongest\nand purest relationships on this planet\nit's more like men are socially\nincentivized and rewarded for\nprioritizing other things above their\nfriendships for instance my best friend\nlives in the same metropolitan area that\nI do\nbut I see him like twice a year\nand that's not because I'm not making\nthe effort to get together\nhis story is that he spends half of his\nWaking Life working\nand the other half of his Waking Life\nwith his wife and kids\nfortunately he seems mostly content with\nhis life however this is the story of\nmillions of men over time their friends\nkind of become the 10th most important\nthing in their lives which functionally\nreduces them to insignificance and I\nsuppose this is fine as long as the man\nis happy and as long as the situation\nworks\nwhat can happen however is that a guy\ncan run into financial trouble maybe he\ngets hurt maybe he loses his job and\nthat in turn destabilizes his\nrelationship which can lead to divorce\nand just like that the two pillars of\nhis life to which he has devoted the\nlast 20 years of his life work and\nmarriage can topple possibly even\nthrough no fault of his own\nand because his entire social network\nwas his colleagues and his wife's\nfriends these men can find themselves\ndesperate and alone\nand this is one of the primary reasons\nwhy suicide rates in men are so high\nfollowing a divorce the protective\nfactor of a support system is one of the\nthings that tends to make women more\nresilient in the face of setbacks for\ninstance the demographic with the lowest\nsuicide rates historically has been\nblack women and this is not because\nthese folks tend to suffer fewer\nhardships than others the general\nconsensus here is that their tight-knit\nsocial networks can help them through\ntheir darker moments in any case it's\nimportant for men to actively maintain\ntheir friendships throughout their\nlifespan but it can be hard if you only\ndepend on your old friends friends who\nmay have moved away and are now busy\nwith their careers and their families so\nwhat do you do\nnow before I give you the answer if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and you can also tip me\nby hitting the super thanks buttons the\nthree little dots in the lower right\nhand corner uh you can tip me in\nproportion to the value that you believe\nthat you've received from this message\nbecause it's your support that makes all\nof this happen and I really appreciate\nyour help\nnow I have a Surefire way to make\nfriends as an adult if you follow this\nadvice I can almost guarantee that you\nwill have a few close friends in three\nmonths time which is actually pretty\nincredible\nhere's the hack to making friends as an\nadult\nthe way to make friends as an adult is\nto enroll in some kind of training or\ncertification program this could be a\n200 hour yoga teacher training program\nthis could be a cordon bleu pastry chef\ncertification this could be a Wilderness\nsurvival program it can really be\nanything as long as it's connected to\nsome form of achievement\nlet me break down how this works\nfirst of all the fastest way to build\nrelationships is to undergo a shared\ntrial\nthat's why the closest bestest buddies\nin the world are war buddies it's the\nguys that stand shoulder to shoulder\nwith you in the trenches with whom you\nform deep and abiding friendships\nundergoing a shared trial brings people\ntogether as it functionally forces them\nto lean on each other in order to\novercome the trial so by entering into a\nperiod of apprenticeship where you will\nbe asked to perform a great deal in a\nshort amount of time you will be\nundergoing a shared difficulty with your\nfellow aspirins what's more these\nprograms tend to be very intensive and\nthis intensity works in your favor here\nto make a friend you actually need to\nspend time with the other person let's\nsay you try to make a buddy by going to\nthe Wednesday night Jiu Jitsu class at\nthe local Dojo every week in a year you\ncould have spent around 50 hours\ntogether not bad\nbut if you were to enroll in some kind\nof training camp you might be able to\nspend a couple hundred hours together in\nthe span of a few months thus you could\naccomplish in four months what might\notherwise have taken you four years\nthese programs offer a concentrated\nopportunity to bond with other people\nundergoing a shared trial in a shorter\namount of time allowing you to leave\nwith some close friends in a matter of\nweeks instead of years\nand because it's tied to some kind of\nachievement or certification you're not\ngoing to encounter the kind of flakiness\nor non-investment that plagues casual\nclasses when there is an enrollment cost\nand a personally relevant goal at stake\npeople tend to be much more committed\nthey show up regularly which is\nimportant as you can't really build a\nrelationship with someone who comes and\ngoes and because there's a goal involved\nthese programs often attract a higher\ncaliber of person than those you might\nfind just hanging around at the local\npub\nafter all these are people who like you\nare interested in some form of\nself-development which is why they have\ninvested in a particular certification\nprogram\nso that's the easiest way to make\nfriends as an adult enroll in some kind\nof intensive time limited program\nconnected to a form of achievement and\nideally this program should concern\nitself with something you actually enjoy\nlike if you don't care about yoga don't\nsign up for the yoga teacher training\nprogram this is especially true for men\nwho tend to bond side by side as opposed\nto face to face male bonding often\nrequires at least the pretext of an\nactivity even if it's just watching the\ngame\nprograms create a reason for men to get\ntogether and connect so have fun what do\nyou think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel you may also\nbecome
