    "transcript": "the idea that the intensity of my\ndevotion or the purity of my love is\nsomething more noble more refined than\nanything that can be bought or anything\nthat a man with means and success can\nprovide and therefore should be prized\nhigher than those things in a woman's\ndecision-making is ultimately a\nmarketing strategy it's an attempt to\ninfluence the perception of the target\naudience to increase demand for the\ncommodity in question in reality we all\nknow that it's not enough for a man to\nbe loved by just being himself because\nif it were every man would be in a\nrelationship every man would have women\ntalking to him every man would have\noptions with women remember there's more\nof them than there are of us so simple\nsupply and demand should be working in\nour favor and that is clearly not the\ncase what happens is that the top level\nmen are securing the vast majority of\nfemale attention and they do this not\nbecause of who they are deep down inside\nbut because of what they've built"
