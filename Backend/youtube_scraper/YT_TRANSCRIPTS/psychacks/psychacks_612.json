    "transcript": "now you mentioned something else though\nwhich is besides the expectation\num you didn't use this word but what I\nthink you were getting at is like\nwounding\nso\nwhat was the word wounding like they\nhave emotion people have emotional\nwounds like maybe they had a [ __ ]\nrelationship with their mother and so\nnow they have [ __ ] relationships with\ntheir girlfriends like that's not an\naccident\nso what I've discovered and I have a\nvideo on this that's forthcoming is in\nmy own experience when I was in my 20s I\nhad this like Sixth Sense\nI could walk into a room full of woman\nwomen and just like be able to pick out\nthe one that I could ride the roller\ncoaster with because like my emotional\nwound would resonate in the presence of\na complementary emotional wound and we\nwould get together and we'd find\nourselves and be very passionate and\nintense because we were recreating the\ncircumstances that led to the wounding\nin a misguided attempt to heal the world\nyep and we were attracted to that not\nbecause it was good but because it was\nfamiliar yep and this is tough because\nthis goes back to Childhood stuff and\nchildren will accept any reality of\nwhich they're given they don't even\nreally like if a child is born and\nraised in chaos he will think that chaos\nis normal he won't even think that it's\nchaos he will just think that it's\nnormal\nand so when he leaves the family where\nchaos makes sense he goes and tries to\nI'm a good boy I'm doing what you're\nsupposed to do in relationships which is\nto be chaotic and unpredictable and\nthis is all I've ever seen this is all\nI've ever known I thought this is what\nyou you do\num the fish can't see the water and so\nit's particularly difficult for people\nwho are raised in high conflict or\nbroken or dysfunctional families but it\nis possible to overcome that wounding to\nheal that wounding and overcome that\nprogramming and at 30 I mean hopefully\nyou have at least another 50 good years\nof life left so even if it takes a few\nyears to do it's like that's worth doing\nhow is he going to spend your time if\nnot working on this stuff yeah I guess\nyou'd have to take up knitting or\nsomething how are you doing now are you\nstill attracted to women based on your\nwounds no because what I found is that\nas I worked to heal that emotional\nwounding okay so this is the other part\nof it which is so I I'd have that sixth\nsense to the women that I could recreate\nthose dramas with and then they would\nget too crazy and I'd think I just can't\nhandle this anymore I just want a nice\nstable woman and just like in the\nRomantic myth I'd find that nice stable\nwoman and I would be bored to tears and\nI would think there's this isn't I don't\nfeel anything and so I felt for a long\ntime like I had this terrible choice\nbetween what I\nbut I was really attracted to but was\nterrible for me this is something that I\ndidn't really feel anything for but I\nknew was like healthy and mature\nneither one of those look on your face\nlike oh like a good woman who treats me\nwell what a what a drag well yeah you\neat junk food all your life you think\nthat uh you know vegetables are\ndisgusting but you know you see how it\nis so\nI had to like try to squeeze up some\nattraction for some of these stable\nwomen and that didn't work or I tried to\nmake the unstable women more\nso basically I I had to change me\nbecause I couldn't change the women and\nas I process the stuff and healed it\nsurprise surprise\nmy authentic attraction began to change\nlike I didn't have to try to be\nattracted to different women my\nauthentic desire began to shift and I\nstarted to become attracted to\nemotionally stable secure women as I\nbecame more emotionally stable and\nsecure and holy [ __ ] does that solve a\nlot of problems\ngetting in you just never encounter them\nwhen you get into relationships with\nemotionally stable secure women oh man\nit's great oh so beautiful uh it's it's\njust that's the story of so many men you\nwould you just put this so well and it's\na good reminder to me that like\nlike I'll admit I'm human sometimes I\nget frustrated at guys who are in that\nstage that you're out of like she's\ngreat but I'm bored I'm like what like\nlike\nyou know sort of do that but I love the\nfact that you actually articulated that\nthe desire naturally shifted once you\nmade that shift that's what that's what\nguys should be aspiring to and it's one\nof the reasons why I say\nlike I'm not a big fan of these guys who\nare just like living the player\nlifestyle like that's not my version of\nmasculinity is just [ __ ] a bunch of\nwomen because I've seen too clearly the\npsychological underpinnings of a man who\nneeds that kind of level of distraction\nand Novelty I'm not a big fan of\npolyamory I'm not because to me\nyou can see how\nbased on what you just said monogamy\nwith a good woman is almost a test of\ncharacter only somebody who's genuinely\ncomfortable and at peace inside\nthemselves and who's done that work is\ngoing to be able to unlock those innate\nfeelings of yes I actually like this I\nactually enjoy this and this is a fine\nline for me to walk because I'm very\nsensitive to accusations that I would\nshame male sexuality and I'm not doing\nthat I get it male brain new women\ndifferent body parts\nhugely stimulating I get the\nevolutionary psychology of it I'm never\ngoing to deny that even me 13 years into\na relationship a pretty girl comes up on\nthe TV screen I notice I get that but\nwhat I'm saying is that that doesn't\nnecessarily Trump out the stuff that Dr\nRyan was talking about that natural\naffection that natural love that Springs\nup when you're coming from a more\nemotionally healthy Place suddenly that\ndrama queen party girl that used to\nexcite you so much she just looks like a\nhot mess you just like [ __ ] no I don't\nwant to touch that I don't want to get\nthat in my space my nice clean\npsychologically pure space I don't want\nit contaminated with that kind of toxic\nlow quality woman anymore she's no\nlonger interesting oh look this girl\ntreats me nicely she smiles she pays me\ncompliments she asked me how my day was\nsuddenly I'm like able to appreciate\nthat in a whole new way and I hope that\neverybody aspires for that\nyeah I think I watched to John\nMulvaney uh stand up routine he's a\ncomedian and I think he opened with I\ndidn't know that relationships were\nsupposed to feel good and everybody\nlaughed and he was like that's not a\njoke that's just an observation uh and\nthis is the first time I was in a\nrelationship and it improved my quality\nof life and that's enough that's a\nlife-changing experience for a lot of\nguys for sure it kind of sorry to jump\nin but it I I really want to make this\npoint it kind of\nspeaks to the Primacy of our\npsychological need to heal those initial\nwounds in that if you've got a girl in\nfront of you and you could have a\nromantic connection with her but\nsubconsciously you're sabotaging it\nyou're picking fights you're provoking\nbehaviors what your brain is trying to\ndo is resolve those emotional wounds\nthat Dr Orion was talking about from\nearlier on and that just says everything\nthat how a big an impact this trauma\nstuff has on us in that when choosing\nbetween should we just enjoy the present\nmoment and have nice feelings of love or\nshould we make this a hell but it's a\nhell that's potentially going to heal\nthis deeper hell that's inside me the\nbrain moves towards this and so men\ndon't underestimate it men are way too\ncocky about their mental health you've\nprobably seen this like I'll just go to\nthe gym I'll just make a whole bunch of\nmoney I'll just [ __ ] enough women and\nthen that'll solve it it won't it won't\nyou've got to take this stuff seriously\nbecause if you don't when the time comes\nand you're in front of a good woman if\nyou haven't sorted your [ __ ] out you'll\n[ __ ] up the relationship you'll sabotage\nit because your brain so desperately\nneeds to heal this stuff and I've Just\nSeen sorry for getting a bit worked up\nbut I've seen so many requests in my hey\nhero in my patreon DMs from guys who\nhave [ __ ] up good relationships\nbecause they underestimated how messed\nup they were inside that they didn't\ntake it seriously and so I really really\nwant men to hear that message that if\nyou want to have a good relationship in\nthe future you can't half-ass this\nyou've got to sort yourself out\nrelationships with good women are a\nluxury of the men who've done the work\non themselves it's not available to\nanybody else the best that you're going\nto be able to have is a dysfunctional\nrelationship and as far as I can see\nthat's an absolute truth I've not seen\nit work otherwise\nyeah there's a lot there so the way I\nusually say it is that you can't solve\ninternal problems with external\nSolutions so if you have an inner wound\nor an internal void which is often how\nit's experienced you're going to try to\nfill it with money with drugs with TV\nand video games with food with sex and\nit doesn't work\num that whole inside you is insatiable\nand it cannot be filled with something\nthat's external to itself but it can be\nfilled with something it can be healed\ninternally\nand um what you described about how\nmessed up guys go to relationships\nand mess those up in similar ways in\nClinical Psychology we have a term for\nthat we call that\num a an activist or a reenactment and\nthis happens in the therapy office too\nand there's this kind of a tragedy to\nthis because\nthe the unconscious rationalization for\nthis behavior is okay I was really\nmessed up by this experience in the past\nand I can't go back and change the past\nso what I'm going to do is I'm going to\nrecreate the same emotional experience\nin the present so that I can work\nthrough it and have a different outcome\nthe tragedy is that most people haven't\nlearned the skills of being or relating\nto achieve a different outcome so what\nthey they have a lot of skills in\nrecreating the same situation they don't\nhave the skills to do anything\nand so they they're trying on this this\nwas an idea from Freud actually they're\ntrying unconsciously to solve these\nemotional problems by recreating the\nsame emotional experiences but they lack\nthe skills and the Transcendence to\nactually achieve a different outcome and\nso that's why they end up hitting their\nhead against the wall over and over\nagain"
