    "transcript": "in the sexual Marketplace things are not\nalways what they seem for instance many\nwomen are romantic on the surface and\npragmatic at their core they are making\ncold rational decisions about who to\nmate and date and often do a great deal\nof social Research into their targets\nand use all kinds of strategies to\nsecure the best possible deal for\nthemselves among their available options\non the other hand men tend to be\npragmatic on the surface and romantic at\ntheir core there's even this popular\nmachismo that struts surrounding crows\nman I don't care I don't even need women\nthey're Stone Cold up until the girl\nwalks out the door and then they're a\nmess for weeks or months afterwards\nnever trust a woman generally means of\ncourse that the man in question once in\nfact trusted a woman probably because he\nwas under some illusions with respect to\nhow women love a lot of angry men are\nactually spurned Romantics who still\ncling to their beliefs about how things\nare supposed to be"
