    "transcript": "now meaning is a way for the mind to\nresolve cognitive dissonance your mind\nwill think why the hell are we doing\nthis we're not getting anything out of\nit but we're doing it anyway or what the\nheck it looks like someone else is\nbenefiting from our efforts what's in it\nfor us and one of the ways that the mind\nwill Comfort itself is by deciding oh\nthis must be a meaningful important\nthing to do that's why we're doing it\nnow there is a trap here and the trap is\nthinking that all effort devoid of\ncompensation is inherently meaningful It\nIsn't So not getting any obvious reward\ndoes not necessarily mean that you're\nhelping others or pursuing meaningful\naction however your mind in its efforts\nto reduce its dissonance might make you\nthink that you are and you can avoid\nthis trap by considering well is anyone\nelse benefiting from this effort action\nthat is neither rewarded nor benefits\nothers is wasteful at best and miserable\nat worst and this is why a lot of the\nactivity that folks find meaningful has\nto do with serving others"
