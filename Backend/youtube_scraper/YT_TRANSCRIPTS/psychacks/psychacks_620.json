    "transcript": "today I'm going to share with you my\nrecipe for creating meaning in life\nthere's this question that many\nself-help gurus ask their clients the\nquestion is what would you do if you\nknew you couldn't fail and it's a good\nquestion because it allows people to see\nthe extent to which fear is holding them\nback from pursuing the life they really\nwant to live however there is another\nreally important complementary question\nto ask and the question is what would\nyou do if you knew you couldn't succeed\nnow on the surface this sounds like a\nridiculous question you might respond\nOrion if I knew I couldn't succeed why\nwould I bother trying and that is an\nunderstandable response a lot of things\nif you knew that you could not get what\nyou were striving for would you and\nshould you give up their Pursuit\nabsolutely but here's the thing there\nare things in life worth doing even if\nwe don't wholly succeed in attaining\nthem in the world some mountains are\nworth dying on even if you don't reach\nthe summit"
