    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychak's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is how to create more meaning\nin your life\nso this is something that I get asked\nwith some degree of frequency in my\nconsultations and in my private practice\nparadoxically this question often comes\nfrom very successful individuals that is\npeople have already made a great deal of\nmoney achieve some measure of status or\nsignificance and established a family\nwith children externally looking at\ntheir Lifestyles they have achieved\neverything that Society has told them\nit's worthwhile to achieve the issue is\nthat on some level\nthey still feel unfulfilled\nand this kind of makes sense once all of\na person's material conditions have been\ntaken care of the issue of life's\nmeaning becomes much more Salient For\nBetter or Worse it's much more difficult\nto focus on these concerns when you're\njust struggling to get by when people\nare living month to month they are more\nconcerned about survival and escaping\nmisery than say about questions of\nexistential meaning these are questions\nthat are Universal to humanity but that\nare also somewhat privileged and that's\nwhy they often come up in the context of\nfolks who have more successful lives\ntoday I'm going to share with you my\nrecipe for creating meaning in life\nthere's this question that many\nself-help gurus ask their clients the\nquestion is what would you do if you\nknew you couldn't fail\nand it's a good question because it\nallows people to see the extent to which\nfear is holding them back from pursuing\nthe life they really want to live\nbecause most people are afraid of pain\nand failure this question helps to\nclarify for the clients their true\ndesires untainted by self-limiting\nbeliefs so it's a useful question\nhowever there is another really\nimportant complementary question to ask\nthat as far as I know none of these\ngurus do but it's a question that I\nroutinely ask my patients\nand the question is\nwhat would you do if you knew you\ncouldn't succeed\nnow on the surface this sounds like a\nridiculous question you might respond\nOrion if I knew I couldn't succeed like\nif there was a zero percent chance of\nachieving the desired outcome\nwhy would I bother trying\nand that is an understandable response a\nlot of things if you knew that you could\nnot get what you were striving for would\nyou and should you give up their Pursuit\nabsolutely\nbut here's the thing\nthere are things in life worth doing\neven if we don't wholly succeed in\nattaining them\nin the world some mountains are worth\ndying on\neven if you don't reach the summit\nand this is actually wonderful news as\nthe highest goals to which Humanity can\naim probably won't be achieved in your\nor my lifetime\nif we couldn't climb a little higher and\nhave that effort matter if all Hills had\nto be summited in our little lifetimes\nthen everything would be reduced to the\nlevel of Personal Achievement which is\nexactly where a lot of successful people\nfind themselves\nthe answer to the question what would\nyou do what would you still do if you\nknew you couldn't succeed will reveal to\nyou the most significant opportunities\nto develop meaning in your life\nif you think about it it's actually hard\nto transform an achievement into\nsomething more meaningful that's because\nachievement is an external reward like\nmoney or sex or status or fame\nthese things are compensations for\nsuccessful effort and because they exist\nthere is no reason for your mind to\nproduce internal compensations it's like\nhow are you going to focus if you're\npopping Adderall all the time\nbut if we remove all of those external\ncompensations if we take away all the\nmoney and the sex and the status and the\nfame if we even take away the\nself-satisfaction of virtue or the\npossibility of transcendent Glory\nthen the mind will begin to generate a\ncompensation for itself\nand that compensation is meaning\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button it's the three little dots\nin the lower right hand corner and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've received from this message\nbecause it's your donations that make\nall of this happen couldn't do it\nwithout you and I really appreciate your\nsupport\nnow meaning is a way for the mind to\nresolve cognitive dissonance your mind\nwill think why the hell are we doing\nthis we're not getting anything out of\nit but we're doing it anyway or what the\nheck it looks like someone else is\nbenefiting from our efforts what's in it\nfor us\nand one of the ways that the mind will\nComfort itself is by deciding oh\nthis must be a meaningful important\nthing to do that's why we're doing it do\nyou understand now there is a trap here\nand the trap is thinking that all effort\ndevoid of compensation is inherently\nmeaningful it isn't\nso not getting any obvious reward does\nnot necessarily mean that you're helping\nothers or pursuing meaningful action\nhowever your mind in its efforts to\nreduce its dissonance might make you\nthink that you are\nyour mind will like naturally produce\nthis justification in the absence of\nexternal compensation so you will have\nto watch out for that and you can avoid\nthis trap by considering well\nis anyone else benefiting from this\neffort\naction that is neither rewarded nor\nbenefits others is wasteful at best and\nmiserable at worst\nand this is why a lot of the activity\nthat folks find meaningful has to do\nwith serving others in some capacity\nwhether it's their own children\nor the people in their Community or\nHumanity as a whole\nhowever it's probably fair to say that\nirrespective of the intended beneficiary\nthe more that you personally benefit\nfrom your action the less meaningful\nthat action becomes and that's because\nthose personal rewards like weeds kind\nof Choke out the space in which\nmeaningfulness which is a more slow\ngrowing tree would otherwise Sprout do\nyou get what I'm saying\nsome fights are worth fighting\neven if we personally can't win\nand that's because some fights are\nreally Wars that must be fought over\nGenerations perhaps even eternally the\nvictory may not be for us to enjoy\nhowever we can choose to you know move\nthe standard a little further down the\nfield\nand Unite with a movement that as\nsomething larger than us is transcendent\nby Nature\nfighting for a victory that you won't be\nable to enjoy negates the egoic\ncontribution to the effort and creates\nthe opportunity for something to matter\nmore than your little Personal\nAchievement\nthis is how meaning is born\nin short you will increase the\nlikelihood of cultivating meaning in\nyour life to the extent that you succeed\nin finding things that are worth doing\neven without the compensations of\nsuccess\nthat's where you need to look\nand that shouldn't be too tall of an\norder a especially for those successful\nfolks out there don't you already have\nenough success why not sacrifice the\npossibility of Superfluous reward in\norder to achieve something that to you\nin particular is far more valuable\nthis of course is the last place that\nmany successful people think to look\nsince they've trained themselves to look\nfor opportunities for achievement\nand that's of course why it's precisely\nhere where it is to be found\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like priority review of\ncomments
