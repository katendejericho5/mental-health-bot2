    "transcript": "the reality has a certain\nlike we all know that when you when you\ntake reality and then you distort it\nthrough your own interpretation your\nlens and you use it to play out some\nfantasy like if you find an average girl\nwith an average personality but you\nproject on her all this amazingness and\nyou live out this pretend fantasy for a\ncouple of weeks that she's this\nincredible girl she's gonna solve all\nyour problems there's a kind of like\nlike an amphetamine style like high that\ncomes from that is like oh I'm getting\naway from reality I'm doing this but\nyou've got to keep kind of going\nand it's it's it's not very satisfying\nin fact it's anxiety provoking it's not\nreally that good so in case you're like\ninclined to not process your grief\nbecause you don't want to give up these\ndelusions about how special and amazing\nwomen are then to solve all your\nproblems you'll be happily ever after in\ncase you don't want to do that work let\nme tell you that you're not really\ngiving up anything that's that's special\nyou know what I mean playing out that\nfantasy is not that good the reality of\na good relationship it's it's more like\ncalm it's like gentle it's peaceful you\nknow what I mean there's a sort of quiet\nsatisfaction and pride that never\nexpresses itself with really intense\nemotions or a huge rush of thoughts or\nor aspirations about the future no it's\nquite grounded and based on on the\npresent moment and it's infinitely more\nsatisfying so\nlike grave because you're not giving up\nanything good like what you get\nwhat you get at the end of The Grieving\nthe the dream as Dr Ryan just said is\nyou get reality and reality is so much\nbetter than anything that you could\nimagine if you do it right I suppose\nyeah yeah this reminds me of the origin\nmyth of romantic love which is the um\nthe myth of Tristan and his oldie are\nyou familiar with that myth I'm not and\njust as a small technical thing is your\ncamera like bobbing up and down ever so\nslightly is it I maybe I'm oh I'm\nknocking the table so it kind of okay\nI'll try not to do that thanks for\ncalling that out so um\nthis is like the foundational myth of\nWestern romantic love it originated in\nthe south of France in like the 13th\ncentury and it's a very interesting\nstory\num Tristan is a knight in the service of\nhis King and he basically drinks a magic\npotion that causes him to fall in love\nwith\nthe king's wife and she drinks the same\nposter so she falls in love with him and\nso they have this horrid passionate love\naffair that\nexists even though they don't even know\neach other even though they don't even\nreally like each other they kind of are\nmiserable when they're apart but also\nlike especially miserable when they're\ntogether and in the course of this story\nTristan actually like swears this woman\noff ah this is crazy I have to stop\nseeing this woman and she's like no I I\nhave to we can never do this again and\nhe gets involved with a woman who's\nin this in the myth is also named\nassaulty but it's a different facility\nand she's the assaulty of the white hand\nand in this relationship they can have\nthey live together like she is a textile\nperson and they have dinner together and\nthey they like create a household\nit's a peaceful ordinary relationship\nthat's functional\nand Tristan is completely bored like he\ncan't stop thinking about the first\nfacility\nand he eventually leaves that\nrelationship because it felt\nunfulfilling like something was missing\nand I think this is really important\nbecause what you talked about is you\nmaybe you can't get everything that you\nwant from a relationship maybe part of\nthe problem here is that people are\ngoing to relationships expecting the\nwrong things but\nit could be that if you leave those\nexpectations to the side there's enough\nthat you can get out of an actual\nrelationship to justify let's say the\nsacrifices involved in creating and\nmaintaining it\noh my God yeah really well put so to add\non to that just to flesh it out and put\nsome flesh on the bones here\na lot of people did not grow up with\nhaving all of their emotional needs and\ntheir attachment needs adequately met by\ntheir parents parenting in the west is a\nbit of a disaster\num I think we're getting better in some\nregards but for the most part for the\ngeneration of me I'm 35 Dr Ryan's 40 I\nthink a lot of people kind of become\nadults but they're stunted emotionally\nthey have a bunch of unmet needs and\nthen you couple that with the fairy tale\nhappily ever after Hollywood soul mate\nkind of fantasy myth I've got to find my\nmissing half a lot of people are\nbringing a huge amount of expectations\nto their partner they're going to solve\nthis they're going to solve that like\nthey're going to fix all of these things\nand it's unrealistic but if you can\nunderstand what the limitations of a\nwoman what a wife or even a boyfriend if\nthis doesn't have to be gender but what\na partner can do for you then in the\ncourse of that relationship you will try\nand get those unmet needs met realize\nthat it's not appropriate and then if\nyou're diligent you can work through it\nand that the relation relationship\nitself can become an Arbiter of reality\nof what's appropriate to ask of another\nperson and what's not and you never\ndelve too deeply into codependence you\nactually work on becoming too\ninterdependent people that's quite\nfunctional and so it becomes a vehicle\nfor self-growth in a sense and once\nyou've used that process to its\ncompletion you realize holy it's\nthrough this relationship that I've\nactually discovered where I start and\nwhere I begin like where my boundaries\nare who I am and I've also helped this\nother person come that way at that point\nwhen you're not bonded through\nobligation or codependence that's I\nthink where True Love Actually exists\nit's a pair bonded trust respect Mutual\nenjoyment of each other's company and\nit's incredible it's amazing\nbut it's specifically all those good\nthings because it never tries to be\nsomething that it's not it's a lot of\nguys are coming to me and the fight to\nhaving their girlfriend are just\nvariations of this exact theme and so\nwhat I I tell them is that\nyou'll probably love this as a\npracticing clinician but there's nothing\nwrong with the emotions that you have\nthe needs that you that you have the the\nunmet needs it's just that she's not the\nright person to fix that girlfriends are\nnot your mothers and he's like well I\nhave a relationship with my mother\nlike what am I going to do I'm like a 30\nyear old man now I was like yeah I get\nthat go see a therapist you know go see\nDr Ryan go see somebody else because\nthere are actual qualified professionals\nwho exist to help you work through all\nof that stuff and you can be codependent\nyou can have transference with that\nperson you can play out all of your\ninsecurities in that therapist's office\nand get those needs met and it's so much\nhealthier to do that with that person\nthan to try and do it with your\nrelationship because there are so many\ngood relationships that are ending\nsimply because of unrealistic\nexpectations and that's a tragedy\nwell yeah a lot there so Robert Johnson\nam I making really long monologues I\napologize this is great man I'm really\nenjoying talking with you so Robert\nJohnson is a jungian psychologist he\nwrote a book called we which is a really\nwonderful book it's about 100 pages long\npeople can read it in an afternoon and\nit's a jungian interpretation of the\nTristan and soldiment and basically his\nfundamental\nthesis is that romantic love is a\nconflation of the human and the Divine\nand that's symbolized by the magic\npotion that Tristan they sold a drink\nit's made out of herbs so it's like\nnatural and earthy but it also is magic\nso it's supernatural and the danger\ncomes when we expect the other person to\nbe more than human or divine\nthat they can solve all of our problems\nthat they can make us complete that they\ncan make us happy and another person\ndoesn't and shouldn't and can't have\nthat kind of power over you unless you\ngive it to them inappropriately and\nthat's a disaster because we have to\nremember that in every classic romance\nin literature and history every classic\nromance ends in tragedy ends in death\nlike and that's because on some level\nthe Romantic idea is that the lovers can\nbe United at once only in the next life\nso\nit's not possible for romantic lovers to\nactually live happily ever after here\nthe Romantic narrative The Narrative Arc\nof romance is tragedy\nand that's why the Romantic cause is\nalways the one that's the underdog the\none that doesn't really have any chance\nof winning it's hard to root for the\nYankees unless you're from the Bronx\nthere you have no soul because they have\nyou know all those championships it it's\nhard to root for the\nthe thing that works the thing that's\nsuccessful people don't like to do that\nfor whatever reason"
