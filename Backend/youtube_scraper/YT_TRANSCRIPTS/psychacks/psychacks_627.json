    "transcript": "back in the day I was pretty messed up I\nwas raised in a very chaotic family my\nrelationship models left much to be\ndesired I experienced a lot of death and\nloss in my teenage years I was just not\nin a good place all that is to say I had\na lot of emotional wounding and that\nwound was the sixth sense I mentioned\nearlier it resonated it like came to\nlife in the presence of women with a\ncomplementary wound and in a room full\nof people there are plenty of wounded\nwomen I don't really understand how this\nworks and I know this doesn't sound very\nscientific but it's like experientially\ntrue over and over again I found myself\nwith women with complementary wounds and\nwhen we got together we would reenact\nour wounding with each other in a way\nthat certainly didn't feel good but that\nfelt familiar it felt familiar even\nthough it was painful if you grow up in\nConflict then conflict feels familiar if\nyou grow up in chaos then chaos feels\nfamiliar"
