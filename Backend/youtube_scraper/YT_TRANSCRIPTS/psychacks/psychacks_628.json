    "transcript": "in my teens and 20s I had a sixth sense\nfor women with whom I could have\nspectacularly destructive relationships\nI could walk into a room full of people\nand like sniff out the women who would\nbe down to ride the roller coaster my\nrelationships were extremely passionate\nand intense were characterized by brain\nmelting sexual chemistry and were\nfundamentally unstable and destructive\nhowever I would eventually get fed up\nwith the drama and when I did I sought\nout a nice responsible emotionally\nstable woman to date who absolutely\nbored me to tears I did my best but I\ncould not drum up any authentic interest\nin these women so we would inevitably\nbreak up and I'd go back to find another\nroller coaster eventually I got to the\nplace where I realized I had two equally\nunattractive options either I could go\nafter what I was authentically attracted\nto but was absolute poison for me or I\ncould resign myself to a decent woman\nwhom I felt nothing for if this is you\nthen have courage there is a way out of\nthis predicament"
