    "transcript": "a date is connection plus sexual\npossibility note I'm not saying\nconnection plus sex like the sex is\nguaranteed it's not but for a date to be\na date the possibility that the\nconnection becomes sexual must exist and\nthis my friends is what makes the date\nGod's perfect creation because when\neverything goes right both the man and\nthe woman get what they want the woman\ngets her connection she gets her\nattention and her emotional engagement\nand her validation she feels heard she\nfeels cared for she feels safe and since\nthe connection comes first it gives the\nwoman time and opportunity to have her\narousal cultivated which is important\nbecause woman's arousal is typically\nmore reactive and less spontaneous than\nman's and when everything goes right the\nman actualizes that sexual possibility\nwith a sexual encounter which is pretty\nself-explanatory ideally both parties\nare satisfied as each has given the\nother what they wanted"
