    "transcript": "my point is that if you have approach\nanxiety you're already doing what I\ndescribe you're moving through external\nreality while remaining focused on an\ninternal fantasy it's just that your\ninternal fantasy is negative and anxiety\nprovoking so you already know how to do\nwhat I'm prescribing and if you change\nthe fantasy you can change how you feel"
