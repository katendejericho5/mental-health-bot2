    "transcript": "let me talk a little bit about how to\napproach a woman confidently as many of\nyou know I used to be an actor some\npeople have this belief about acting\nthat acting is lying and I would counter\nthat bad acting is lying good acting on\nthe other hand is telling the truth\nunder imaginary circumstances good\nactors are honest they're authentic it's\nthe situation that's made up so what\ndoes this have to do with approaching\nwomen well if you're in a bar and the\nscene calls for you to approach an\nattractive woman and you ask yourself\nwell how would I feel about approaching\nan attractive woman in a bar if you're\nlike most men you're gonna think well I\nwould feel nervous about that let's\nassume the scene calls for confidence\nand Poise what can you do well in the\nprivacy of your mind you can either\nevoke a memory or elaborate a fantasy as\nvividly and as realistically as possible\nthat would actually cause you to feel\nconfident and poised and you can focus\nyour mind's eye on that memory or\nfantasy as intensely as possible and\nthis will help you to act authentically\nconfident in an imaginary situation"
