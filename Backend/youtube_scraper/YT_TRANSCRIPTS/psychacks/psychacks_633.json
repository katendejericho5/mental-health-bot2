    "transcript": "if you approach women here and there\nonce or twice a week then it would take\nyou years before you hit that critical\nthreshold that's a significant amount of\ntime a while back I worked with a man in\nhis 20s to overcome his approach anxiety\nhe did it in a weekend but he had to\napproach 676 women and from the way he\ndescribed it let me tell you this man\nwent on an emotional Journey over those\n48 hours from his initial fear and\nTerror to pain and shame to rage and\ncontempt to hopelessness and despair\nuntil ultimately he arrived at emotional\nindifference and to his amazement this\nwasn't an indifference he had to fake or\nan indifference he had to try to\nmaintain it became his default Baseline\nhe was positively rapturous he told me\nit was the first time in his life he\never felt truly free"
