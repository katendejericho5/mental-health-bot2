    "transcript": "basically when early couples have sex\nthey're functionally saying with their\nbodies I want you to come back and the\nstronger the bond the more likely the\nperson will return now this situation\nchanges dramatically over time once a\nrelationship has been defined and a\ncommitment has been secured and a mutual\nlifestyle established the idea that the\nother person is just going to up and\nleave becomes less and less of a\nprobability in fact there is no need to\nwonder whether someone is going to come\nback if they never leave in the first\nplace the relationship becomes more\nsecure but in so doing the other person\nbecomes a sure thing and once this\nhappens one of the primary functions of\nsex the establishment of an emotional\nbond becomes irrelevant and redundant\nthere is no necessity to create Security\nin completely secure relationships"
