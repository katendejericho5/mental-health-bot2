    "transcript": "men are told to to be more vulnerable to\nbe more emotionally expressive to be\nmore caring and you know taking that to\nextreme they often there's a subgroup of\nyou know the current discourse that also\ncalls traditional male qualities of like\nstoicism and res you know that kind of\nemotional resilience to be toxic that\nit's bad for men I could there there\nmight be some degree of truth to it it's\nlike I know men who are so removed from\ntheir own emotions that they wouldn't\nknow if they were feeling anything if it\ncame up in them in the face you know\nthat they've practiced repressing their\nemotions for so long that they've\ncompletely on some level lost access to\nthat dimension of their self which is\nkind of sad I can see that but if\nthere's an alternative between that man\nand the man who's spilling his purse all\nover the place I think it's probably\nbest at least in terms of his success in\nthe sexual Marketplace for him to be the\nformer than the latter"
