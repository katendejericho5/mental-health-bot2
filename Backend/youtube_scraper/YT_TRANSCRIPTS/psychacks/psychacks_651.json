    "transcript": "I want you to appreciate the rather\nstriking fact that to the best of my\nknowledge there has never been a culture\nanywhere on Earth at any time in human\nhistory that recognize the institution\nof marriage and that expected the woman\nto propose to the man pretty wild huh\nfolks could argue that this was due to\nthe corruption of an oppressive\npatriarchy that robbed women of their\nagency and choice however here we are\ntoday with all of our enlightened views\non gender and Power in a day and age\nwhen many young women are outperforming\nyoung men and the expectation is still\nthat the man proposed the woman what\ndoes this mean well it means that on a\nvery fundamental level it is the man who\noffers a place in his life to the woman\nnot the other way around\n[Music]"
