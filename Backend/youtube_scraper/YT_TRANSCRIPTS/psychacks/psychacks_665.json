    "video_title": "Why REJECTION from women is so PAINFUL",
    "transcript": "in a very literal way sex is life and\nsexual opportunity is both a determinant\nand a signal of individual success on\nthe other hand while lack of sex is not\nliterally deaf it is symbolically\nsomething much more pernicious namely\nExtinction this means that on a very\ndeep level rejection from a woman not\nonly signifies that the man in question\ndoes not deserve to reproduce but that\nby extension he does not really deserve\nto exist as his continued genetic\nexistence depends on his ability to\nsuccessfully reproduce"
