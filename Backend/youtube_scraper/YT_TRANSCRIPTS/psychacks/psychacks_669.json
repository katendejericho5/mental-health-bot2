    "transcript": "women treat men the way men treat jobs\nif the compensation at a certain company\nis not the highest which all of the\nthings being equal make it an\nunattractive option for a potential\nemployee then this company will\ngenerally have to provide a number of\nother perks and privileges to compensate\nfor that lower salary maybe they offer\nwork from home or unlimited PTO or\non-site training or exposure\nopportunities or health insurance\nEtc whatever it is they will have to\ngive more to compensate for their lower\nsalary and all of those perks are actual\ncosts for the potential employer by the\nsame token men who are not as attractive\nto a specific woman end up paying more\nin terms of indirect costs and\nintangibles in order to secure the same\nopportunity does that make sense this\nmeans that as a man if you want to have\nmore affordable access to women your\nprimary consideration should be\nincreasing your overall attractiveness"
