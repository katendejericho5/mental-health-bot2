    "video_title": "One common intersexual misunderstanding",
    "transcript": "sometimes there's this failure of\ninterex understanding so for example\nlike we were talking about earlier to\nthe extent that it's true that women\nfind men who are wealthy and\nprofessionally successful more\nattractive than men who are less wealthy\nand less successful all of the things\nbeing equal then they might think oh\nwell if I find that attractive in a man\nthen perhaps a man will find that\nattractive in me so I'm going to\nprioritize becoming High powerered and\nand high earning and high status and\ncombine that with the idea that I'm\nlooking for my equal these women who\npursue that path are often not very\nsuccessful in the sexual Marketplace\nbecause generally by the time they're\nable to get access to those equally\npowerful High status men they're much\nolder and those powerful High status men\ndon't want to wife up women in their\nlate 30s or early 40s especially if they\ncan get someone much younger who is a\nmore attractive reproductive option"
