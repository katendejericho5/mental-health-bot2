    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nall men pay\nnow as we'll see how much they pay\ndepends on a few different factors\nhowever when it comes to women\nall men pay one way or another\nthere's this fantastic scene in the\nmovie Jack Reacher where Jack played by\nTom Cruise is approached by a very\nattractive young woman in a bar I'll put\na link to the scene in the description\nbelow she makes it very clear that she\nwould like to leave with him and he\nreplies that he can't afford her\nwhen she indignantly responds that she's\nnot a hooker he replies that well then\nhe really can't afford her\nand this exchange makes people laugh\nbecause like all good jokes there's some\ntruth to it\nin general when it comes to women the\nmore transactional the relationship\nthe less you actually pay\nthis is because like if we're talking\nabout literal prostitution men in these\nsituations only pay with money\non the other hand if you're dating for a\ncommitted relationship you're generally\npaying with time with attention with\nexclusivity with compromise\nand with money\nand there is never any guarantee of sex\nso while you technically might be\nspending less money on a date than you\nwould on a prostitute the value of all\nthe other things you could be\nsurrendering for seeking sex in a\nrelationship is likely collectively\ngreater than the difference in the\nfinancial transactions\nthe upshot is if you're a man you will\nhave to pay to access the opportunity\nfor sex one way or another and that's\njust the way it is\nhowever there is a silver lining here\nwhich is that the price of that access\nis inversely proportional to the\nparticular woman's interest and\nattraction\nthis means that the more she likes you\nthe greater the discount you will\nreceive though it will never be entirely\nfree\na woman who is very very attracted to\nyou will make it cheap and easy to\naccess her time and will clear the way\nto access the sexual opportunity\nthe flip side of this is that the men\nwho pay the most\nare the ones that women are interested\nin the least\nlet me say that again The Men Who pay\nthe most are the ones that women are\ninterested in the least\nand to the extent that men want to be\nwith women who want to be with them\nthis means that the higher the price the\nlower the rational basis for paying it\nthis is because the more you pay the\nless you get what you want\nand though this is sad it kind of makes\nsense if a woman isn't authentically\ninterested in a man if she's not very\nattracted to him then she will need to\nbe compensated in other ways in order to\nstick around\nas I've previously explained women treat\nmen the way men treat jobs\nif the compensation at a certain company\nis not the highest which all of the\nthings being equal make it an\nunattractive option for a potential\nemployee\nthen this company will generally have to\nprovide a number of other perks and\nprivileges to compensate for that lower\nsalary\nmaybe they offer work from home or\nunlimited PTO or on-site training or\nexposure opportunities or health\ninsurance\nEtc whatever it is they will have to\ngive more to compensate for their lower\nsalary\nand all of those perks are actual costs\nfor the potential employer by the same\ntoken men who are not as attractive to a\nspecific woman end up paying more in\nterms of indirect costs and intangibles\nin order to secure the same opportunity\ndoes that make sense\nthis means that as a man if you want to\nhave more affordable access to women\nyour primary consideration should be\nincreasing your overall attractiveness\nthis is because attractiveness allows\nmen to access the same sexual\nopportunity at a discount\nthis will likely mean investing time and\nmoney into cultivating this dimension of\nyour presentation however you're going\nto be paying either way and if this is\ntrue it makes more sense to pay into\nself-investment than into any given\nsexual opportunity\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow you\ncan also hit the super thanks button\nit's the three little dots in the lower\nright hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you\nderive from this episode because it's\nthose donations that make all of this\npossible I really appreciate your\nsupport\nnow this perspective can be difficult\nfor some men to understand because a lot\nof men have this belief that all women\nwant relationships\nthis belief is less true than the\ncomplementary belief that all men want\nsex which is not entirely true but is\nmostly true\nit's going to sound strange to some\nwomen out there but a lot of men believe\nthat a you want a relationship with\nevery man you sleep with\nand B that you only sleep with men with\nwhom you're in a relationship\nand neither of these things is true\nhowever these beliefs are a big part of\nwhy a men you're not sleeping with are\ntrying to get you into a relationship\nbecause they think they are giving you\nwhat you want in exchange for what they\nwant I.E sex and B men you do sleep with\nghosts you after you sleep with them\nbecause they think that you'll want to\ntie them down forever if they ever see\nyou again\nthe belief that men just want sex isn't\ntrue because\ndespite the fact that men's standards\nare generally pretty low they do still\nhave standards this means they are going\nthere's going to be a lot of women that\nthey're legitimately not going to be\ninterested in sexually\nit's also true that the women that men\nwould be interested in having a\nrelationship with are a subset of the\nwomen that men are interested in\nsleeping with\nsimilarly the belief that women just\nwant a relationship isn't true because\nin general women have extremely high\nstandards for their relationships\nand this is true God help me\neven if they are not the most attractive\nwomen like I've met sixes with higher\nstandards than nines\nwhich just like a local bakery with high\nprices and mediocre pastries makes me\nwonder how they stay in business\nin any case it's also true that the men\nthat women are interested in having a\nrelationship with are a subset of the\nmen that women are interested in\nsleeping with\ndespite men's beliefs of the contrary\nwomen do not just want a relationship\nwith anyone and everyone and every woman\nis not actually trying to lock you into\na relationship\nby default\nall things being equal whether a woman\ndesires sex and or a relationship from\nany given man depends on two factors his\nvalue and his attractiveness\nvalue means things like his net worth\nhis social status and his lifestyle\nattractiveness means his physicality his\nsexiness and his Swagger\nwe can visualize these in a two by two\nPunnett square like so\nas you can see if you're an attractive\nhigh value man women will likely desire\na relationship with you but if you don't\nwant one they'd be willing to offer you\nsex\non the other hand if you are an\nattractive low value man they'd be open\nto a sexual relationship and if you're\nan unattractive high value man they will\nbe open to the possibility of a\nrelationship but sex will likely be an\ninfrequent occurrence and of course men\nwho are neither get nada\nmake sense\nthe point here is that as a man it is\nentirely possible to secure sexual\nopportunities with women without paying\nall the direct and indirect costs\nassociated with a relationship however\nyou still will have to pay something and\nyou will need to be attractive\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten
