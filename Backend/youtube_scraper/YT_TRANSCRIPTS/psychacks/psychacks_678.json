    "transcript": "fewer young people than ever before are\nhaving sex and fewer young people than\never before are entering into\nrelationships this is because most\npeople don't really want a relationship\nremember relationships are the medium in\nwhich value is transacted if you already\npossess the proposed value or if you can\nobtain it more easily or more cheaply or\nmore safely elsewhere there is no need\nto enter into the transaction look at it\nlike this no one really wants a job they\nwant a job because of what a job can\ngive them namely money if people could\nget what they wanted money more easily\nmore cheaply or more safely elsewhere\nthan they probably wouldn't go looking\nfor a job but for the vast majority of\npeople a job is the only way they know\nto get money so they go looking for a\njob that said they don't really want the\njob they want the money and if they had\nthe money they wouldn't go looking for\nthe job"
