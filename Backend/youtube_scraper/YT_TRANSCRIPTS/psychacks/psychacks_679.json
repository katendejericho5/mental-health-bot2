    "transcript": "women are complicated like all people\nthey want to get what they want but on\nanother level they also don't want to\nget what they want how does this work if\na woman succeeds in getting what she\nwants from you too often whether she's\naware of it or not she's going to start\nto feel that she is more powerful than\nyou and that is going to start to make\nher feel unsafe a man who can\nappropriately Hold the Line against her\nconsumptive love communicates that he is\ncentered in his masculine purpose that\nhe can tolerate her distress at being\ndisappointed and that he is more\npowerful than she is which actually\nallows her to relax into the\nrelationship women like to test how much\nthey can get away with which means that\nthey will sometimes even ask for\nunreasonable things just to see if you\nhave the spine to turn them down by\ndisappointing women you communicate that\nyou are maintaining frame which means\nthat she can relax into her feminine\nbecause she is not driving the ship"
