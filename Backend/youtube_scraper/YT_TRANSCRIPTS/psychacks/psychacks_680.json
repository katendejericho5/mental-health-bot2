    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is most people don't really\nwant relationships\nmost people this means men and women\nmost people do not really want\nrelationships and as we'll see this will\ngo far toward explaining why both sex\nand relationships are at historically\nall-time lows especially in younger\nheterosexual populations fewer young\npeople than ever before are having sex\nand fewer young people than ever before\nare entering into relationships why\nmight this be the case\nwell as I said this is because most\npeople don't really want a relationship\nremember\nrelationships are the medium in which\nvalue is transacted if you already\npossess the proposed value or if you can\nobtain it more easily or more cheaply or\nmore safely elsewhere\nthere is no need to enter into the\ntransaction\nlook at it like this no one really wants\na job\nthey want a job because of what a job\ncan give them namely money\nIf people could get what they wanted\nmoney more easily more cheaply or more\nsafely elsewhere than they probably\nwouldn't go looking for a job\nbut for the vast majority of people a\njob is the only way they know to get\nmoney\nso they go looking for a job that said\nthey don't really want the job they want\nthe money and if they had the money they\nwouldn't go looking for the job okay so\nthe same basic premise holds true with\nrespect to heterosexual relationships\nespecially in today's day and age most\npeople don't really want a relationship\nthey want what the relationship can give\nthem\nand if they can get those things more\neasily more cheaply or more safely\nelsewhere than then we would expect them\nnot to enter into relationships as\nfrequently so what do men and women want\nfrom relationships well they want all\nkinds of things but in general men are\ntrading resources that is time energy\nattention and money for sexual\nopportunity\nand women are trading sexual opportunity\nfor resources time attention energy and\nmoney\nif either sex could more easily more\ncheaply and more safely get what they\nwanted in places besides relationships\nwe should predictably see the number of\nrelationships Decline and that's exactly\nwhat's happening\nnow there are two major culprits behind\nthis decline in relationships especially\nin the 20-something demographic\npornography and social media\nand this is very interesting because\nit's generally men who have problems\nwith pornography and it's generally\nwomen who have problems with social\nmedia this obviously isn't always the\ncase but it does seem to fall along\ngendered lines first let's take a look\nat men in porn remember what men\ngenerally want from relationships is to\ntrade resources for sexual opportunity\nif they could get sexual opportunity\nwithout exchanging resources or\nexchanging far fewer resources then they\nare rationally going to move in that\ndirection\nand that's exactly what porn offers men\nporn offers men free immediate and\ndependable sexual opportunity and this\nis only going to improve in the coming\nyears with artificial intelligence and\nvirtual reality\nand rather than transact his one bundle\nof resources for sexual opportunity from\none specific woman\nhe can now transact his one bundle of\nresources for sexual opportunity from an\nunlimited number of women on the\ninternet\nmen are not only able to buy sexual\nopportunities from porn far more cheaply\nthan they would be able to do so from\nwomen but given the abundance of\nrejection and frustration that generally\ncomes from seeking out sexual\nopportunity from women\nfar more safely as well\nso if the sexual opportunity that women\nrepresent is both expensive and high\nrisk then it's little wonder that so\nmany men are moving toward the cheap and\nlow risk sexual opportunity that porn\nrepresents\nnow you could argue that porn isn't\ntruly a sexual opportunity it's just the\nsimulation of sexual opportunity\nand I would agree with you\nmasturbating with porn is definitely not\nthe same thing as having sex with a\nwoman\nbut it's apparently enough like the same\nthing that it's trapping a lot of men\nespecially because from a certain\nperspective it's less risky and less\nexpensive\nin any case men are foregoing\nrelationships at least in part due to\nthe fact that they can transact sexual\nopportunity more easily more cheaply and\nmore safely elsewhere\nso that's men\nnow before I get into women if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really cause the channel\nto grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button those three little dots in\nthe lower right hand corner and tip me\nin proportion to the value you believe\nyou've received from this episode it's\nyour donations that make all this happen\nand I'm very appreciative\nnow what about women\nwell women tend to get trapped by social\nmedia because what are women looking for\nfrom relationships in exchange for\nsexual opportunity they're looking for\nresources time energy attention and\nmoney and women can get these things\nmore easily more cheaply and more safely\non Instagram or only fans than they can\nin relationships so when a woman posts\nthirst traps on Instagram or sexualized\ncontent on only fans she's actually\nusing technology to leverage her sexual\nopportunity through mechanical\nreproduction\nrather than transact her one sexual\nopportunity for resources from one\nspecific man she can now transact her\none sexual opportunity for resources\nfrom an unlimited number of men on the\ninternet\nusing social media a woman is able to\nget the things she would otherwise\ntransact for in a relationship time\nenergy money and attention more easily\nmore cheaply and more safely\nhowever since it's generally easier for\nwomen to extract resources from a man\nthan for men to extract sexual\nopportunity from a woman not as many\nwomen have only fans accounts as men\nhave PornHub accounts\nthat said I would argue that the safer\nCriterion is more important here than it\nis with men\nusing sexual opportunity to obtain\nresources for men is an inherently risky\nEndeavor for women this is not only\nbecause they tend to be smaller and\nphysically weaker but because there is a\nprofound vulnerability in the feminine\nopening herself up to be penetrated by\nthe masculine so if women can eliminate\nthe risk associated with transacting\nsexual opportunity for resources in Vivo\nby digitizing it then you will see a\nsizable proportion of women move in this\ndirection\nnow again you could argue that social\nmedia doesn't provide true resources the\nmoney might be real but the attention is\njust Anonymous likes and the energy is a\nmediated surrogate and I would agree\nwith you the validation and connection\nthat comes from social media are\ndefinitely not the same things as the\nvalidation and connection that come from\nan actual relationship\nbut apparently it's enough like the same\nthing that it's trapping a lot of women\nespecially because from a certain\nperspective it's less risky and less\nexpensive\nin any case women are foregoing\nrelationships at least in part due to\nthe fact that they can now transact\nresources more easily more cheaply and\nmore safely elsewhere\nso what's the upshot\nthat people are increasingly replacing\nrelationships with simulated\nrelationships that is rather than\ntransact resources for sexual\nopportunity in actual relationships\npeople are increasingly transacting\nsimulated resources for simulated sexual\nopportunity in simulated relationships\nand men and women are inhabiting roles\nonline that mirror their roles in the\nreal life sexual Marketplace it's\nfascinating\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd
