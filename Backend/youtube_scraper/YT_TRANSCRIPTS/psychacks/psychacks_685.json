    "transcript": "to maintain a relationship with a woman\nyou need to maintain a high level of\nattraction and to maintain a high level\nof attraction you need to continue to be\nthe person that the woman fell in love\nwith I understand that it's flattering\nthat a woman would be so interested in\nyou that she would want so much of you\nand that it might be distressing to see\nher disappointed in her wanting but you\ncannot allow her desire for you to\ndiminish your lifestyle why because your\nlifestyle as it currently is is\nobviously sufficient to raise her\nattraction to a fever pitch if it ain't\nbroke don't fix it my dude giving up who\nyou are and how you choose to live for a\nwoman will not only mean that you will\nlose the thing that you surrender but\nthat you will move in the direction of\nlosing the woman as well"
