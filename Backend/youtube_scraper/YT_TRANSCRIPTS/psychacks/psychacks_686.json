    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is get used\nto disappointing women\nthe ability to disappoint women is a\nskill and it's a vital skill that men\nmust learn in order to have successful\nrelationships with women now\ndisappointing women can be very\ndifficult for young guys in particular\nbecause not only do they typically\nexperience a strong poll to give women\nwhat they want but they also generally\ndo not have a great deal of options with\nwomen this lack of optionality engenders\na scarcity mentality and this scarcity\nmentality leads them to erroneously\nbelieve that if they don't say yes to\nwhat their women want all of the time\nthen their refusal is going to\njeopardize the foundational basis of the\nrelationship and I have a couple of\nimportant responses to this perspective\nfirst and foremost it is important to\ndisappoint women because the more a\nwoman likes you the more that she is\ninterested in you the more she's going\nto want more of you\nwomen don't love like men do a woman's\nlove is more consumptive\na woman in love wants everything she\nwants all of your time all of your\nattention and if she could she would\ncrawl inside of your head so she could\nknow all your thoughts and feelings you\nsee this kind of reaction in miniature\nwhen women get around babies like oh\nyou're so cute I could just eat you up\nyeah it's like huh in as many different\nways as possible a woman in love wants\nto put you inside of her\nso that's consumptive feminine love now\nas I've said before wanting is free that\nis it costs the wanter absolutely\nnothing to want things but it costs you\nThe Giver something to give things this\nasymmetry means that you are under no\nobligation to give someone what they\nwant simply as a consequence of their\nwanting it and this is great news\nbecause if this weren't true it would\nlead to some devastating consequences\nfor instance if you were actually\nfoolish enough to give a woman all of\nyour time and attention\nall the time and attention that she\nwanted from you then slowly but surely\nyou will have stripped yourself of a\ngreat deal of the things that initially\nmade you attractive to her\nthis means that paradoxically giving a\nwoman everything that she wants actually\nresults in her losing attraction for you\nand if that attraction dips too low she\nwill likely terminate the relationship\nleaving you with nothing\nas by then you will have voluntarily\nsurrendered all the other aspects of\nyour life your friends your hobbies your\npersonal development your side hustles\nyour side pieces in the service of her\nconsumptive love\nto maintain a relationship with a woman\nyou need to maintain a high level of\nattraction and to maintain a high level\nof attraction you need to continue to be\nthe person that the woman fell in love\nwith I understand that it's flattering\nthat a woman would be so interested in\nyou that she would want so much of you\nand that it might be distressing to see\nher disappointed in her wanting\nbut you cannot allow her desire for you\nto diminish your lifestyle why because\nyour lifestyle as it currently is is\nobviously sufficient to raise her\nattraction to a fever pitch if it ain't\nbroke don't fix it my dude\ngoing giving up who you are and how you\nchoose to live for a woman will not only\nmean that you will lose the thing that\nyou surrender but that you will move in\nthe direction of losing the woman as\nwell\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from this message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you can also hit the super\nthanks button those three dots in the\nlower right hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you believe\nyou've received from this episode\nbecause it's your donations that make\nall of this happen and I really\nappreciate your support\nnow another thing to keep in mind with\nrespect to this issue is that women are\ncomplicated like all people they want to\nget what they want but on another level\nthey also don't want to get what they\nwant\nhow does this work look if a woman\nsucceeds in getting what she wants from\nyou too often whether she's aware of it\nor not\nshe's going to start to feel that she is\nmore powerful than you\nand that is going to start to make her\nfeel unsafe\nwhy because if a man can't hold the line\nwith her who really isn't all that big\nof a threat how is he going to be able\nto hold the line with someone else who\nmight legitimately be threatening\na man who can appropriately Hold the\nLine against her consumptive love\ncommunicates that he is centered in his\nmasculine purpose that he can tolerate\nher distress at being disappointed and\nthat he is more powerful than she is\nwhich actually allows her to relax into\nthe relationship\nthis is because women's need to feel\nsafe often leads them to do some pretty\ncounter-intuitive things like shacking\nup with dangerous bad boys or provoking\nmen to fight with them\nwomen like to test how much they can get\naway with which means that they will\nsometimes even ask for unreasonable\nthings just to see if you have the spine\nto turn them down\nby disappointing women you communicate\nthat you are maintaining frame which\nmeans that she can relax into her\nfeminine because she is not driving the\nship\nand I would highly highly encourage men\nto disappoint their women sooner as\nopposed to later in a normal healthy\nrelationship saying no to a request or\nnot being available or not being\ninterested\ndoes not lead to the end of the\nrelationship think about it if your\nbuddy turns down your invitation to go\nto the baseball game with you what's\nyour response probably something like\nhey no problem maybe next time\nand then you move on with your life\nthat is an appropriate response to\ndisappointment however it is\nunfortunately the case that some women\nespecially more immature women can do a\nlot of inappropriate things when\ndisappointed\nthings like throw a temper tantrum or\nsulk in despondency or keep score in\nbitterness or withdraw affection\nEtc\nand don't you think it would be\nimportant to figure out if you're\ndealing with this type of woman early on\nin the relationship\nit's better to learn this in the first\nfive weeks than in the first five months\nor God help you in the first five years\nand this is because continuing on in a\nrelationship with such a woman basically\nmeans that you'll need to constantly\nconform to her expectations of reality\nor suffer the consequences which ain't\nworth it\nand here's one final thing to keep in\nmind men a lot of you are nervous about\ndisappointing your women because you are\nafraid that doing so will make her less\ninterested in having a relationship with\nyou\ndo me a favor\nthink about a time when you've asked a\nwoman for something and she's said no\nas a consequence of that rejection did\nyou like her more or did you like her\nless\nyou probably liked her more\nto use an extreme example when your ex\nbroke up with you you were not suddenly\ndivested of all the positive feelings\nthat you had of her if anything her\nrejection made you want to pursue more\nand try harder\nit increased your attraction because she\nwas fundamentally making herself scarcer\nto you do you see if rejection and\ndisappointment increase your attraction\nwhen a woman does it it will increase a\nwoman's attraction when you do it she is\nnot different from you in this respect\nsaying no rejection disappointment these\nthings are like spices\nfood without spice is Bland\nfood with too much spice is inedible\nthere is little nutritional content so\njust like we like some spice on our food\nwe like some spice in our relationships\nand disappointment is one such spice as\nit tends to increase the attraction of\nwhomever is being disappointed\nwhether this should or should not be the\ncase is irrelevant because that's the\nway it is\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this
