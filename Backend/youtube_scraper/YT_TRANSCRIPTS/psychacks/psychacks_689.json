    "transcript": "how do men blow the first date simple\nthey show up on the first date and they\ntry to impress the woman\nand they generally do this because a\nlittle knowledge is a dangerous thing\nthey do this because they watch some\nYouTube videos about what women want and\nthey learned about hypergamy and they\nthink women are attracted to money\nstatus and Power\nno problem I'll make sure they know how\nmuch money I have how much status I\nenjoy and how much power I yield\nbasically they just need to know that\nI'm a high value man and they'll be\nbegging for it now this is not entirely\nwrong but in terms of seducing a\nparticular woman it is mostly wrong\nespecially given the fact that men tend\nto go about demonstrating their value in\nsuch inelegant and ham-fisted ways too\nmany men think that bragging about their\nprofessional exploits or their lifestyle\nfor an hour or two will get them laid"
