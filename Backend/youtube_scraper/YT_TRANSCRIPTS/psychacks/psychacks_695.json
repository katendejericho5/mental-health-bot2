    "transcript": "my intention here is to to reduce the\nunnecessary suffering in the world and\nthe way I do that is working with my\nclients and of course everything is\nanonymous and but a lot of what I talk\nabout on this channel comes up in my\nclinical practice and I think well if\nthis is a problem that one person is\ndealing with I'm sure it's a problem\nthat many people are dealing with and if\nthis intervention or this solution might\nbe of use to this one person it very\nwell might be of use to many other\npeople so that's kind of the principle\nthat I operate from this isn't a channel\nwhere I talk about academic research\nthis isn't a channel where I talk a lot\nabout Theory this is really practical\nthis is about getting people out of pain\nthis is about helping people make money\nhaving better relationships getting\nthrough the because life is very\nvery hard and we need practical\nactionable solutions to get out of the\ndifficulties that we are subject to\nfinding ourselves in"
