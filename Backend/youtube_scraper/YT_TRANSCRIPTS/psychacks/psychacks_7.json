    "transcript": "in the interpersonal Effectiveness\nmodule of DBT Marshall linahan talks\nabout the three possible goals of any\nhuman interaction ideally we achieve all\nthree of these goals however like any\nideal this is actually extremely rare in\nany case even if we do achieve all three\nwe typically can't achieve all three\nequally which suggests that we have to\nprioritize these goals in our dealings\nwith others as with many things\npertaining to mental health flexibility\nis key if people just prioritize one of\nthe goals all of the time irrespective\nof the goal this tends to lead to\nsuboptimal outcomes so what are the\nthree goals they are objective\nEffectiveness which is getting what you\nwant relationship Effectiveness which is\nmaking sure that the other person feels\ngood about you at the end of the\ninteraction and self-respect\nEffectiveness which is making sure that\nyou feel good about yourself at the end\nof the interaction again ideally people\nget all three people feel good about\ngiving us what we want and we feel good\nabout getting it however in reality this\nis not always the case"
