    "transcript": "ladies it's my understanding that one of\nyour primary concerns about modern\ndating especially in an age where sex\nprecedes commitment is that you will be\nused that is you might enter into a\nsexual relationship with a particular\nman however this might not lead to the\nrelationship outcome you would prefer\nmaybe you're ghosted afterward or you\nenter into a vague situationship that\ndoesn't seem to go anywhere and women\nare subject to considering these\noutcomes to be exploitative or a waste\nof their time and I'm here to address\nthe concern and help you navigate this\nreality successfully to reduce the\nlikelihood of this occurring there are\nthree things you have to do the first is\nexercise appropriate discernment like\nthere are guys out there who will never\ngive you the relationship outcome you\nwould prefer no matter what you do ever\nso you need to get better at figuring\nout who these guys are"
