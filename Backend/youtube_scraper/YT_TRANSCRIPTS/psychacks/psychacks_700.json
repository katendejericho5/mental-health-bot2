    "transcript": "so um for most people what ends up\nhappening the way most people will\ndevelop game in the way same way most\npeople develop sales skills the same way\nmost people develop the Hustler\nmentality they have to\nnow some people try to skip this step by\ngetting money like over there they'll\nsay I'm not going to date until I get\nmoney so then they don't have any game\nthe way you develop game is when you're\non the way up especially and even if\nyou're already there take away some of\nwhat you have don't use it\ntalk to people\nstart learning how to actually have\nconversations with people and develop a\nrelationship out of thin air out of\nnothing\nhow do I go up to this person without\nall my fanciest clothes on how do I go\nup to this person without a\n300 000 watch on my wrist how do I go up\nto people even people I'm not interested\nin on a physical level how do I go up to\npeople and just start developing\nrelationships with them they can be\nplatonic relationships they can just be\nacquaintances how do I go up to people\nand talk to them and have conversations\nand start understanding what people\nactually want\nwhat do people really want\nand what are they willing to do to get\nit\nwhen you that's what if you talk to a\nhustler or you talk to somebody that's\nlike a con person a con man con woman\nwhat they are good at is finding out\nwhat you want\nexactly what your truest desires are and\nwhen they figure out what you want all\nthey do is fill in for that what you\nreally want like most people will say oh\nwell a woman wants to be on a yacht why\nsee you bought a yacht because you saw\ngirls on a yacht why do they want to be\non a yacht\nyou got to figure that part out and\nprovide that with you and not just the\nyacht\nwhat make is it they're looking for the\nexperience they're looking for what they\nbelieve a yacht means\nthe status that a yacht provides the\nenjoyment the the stuff they saw in the\nvideo where everybody was popping\nchampagne and they just seemed like they\nwere having such a good time that's what\nthey want from that yeah most of them\ndon't really know what kind of yacht you\ngot they don't know you know they'll\nhave much yacht information so would it\nbe fair to say that because I often say\nthis to my clients is that if it works\nin sales it works in dating\nand what is in common in both of those\nthings is that what really seems to be\nsuccessful is the ability to cultivate\nan emotional experience\nabsolutely that is can we say that\nthat's kind of game in a nutshell is the\nability to cultivate an emotional\nexperience absolutely absolutely and to\nmake that experience something that they\nfeel like they can't get anywhere else\num\nfor people who grew up in the 80s and\n90s that was the crack era right in the\n80s and 90s they had this like they had\nthese people that y'all probably some of\ny'all younger people may not even know\nabout crackheads but they would just be\njust really on you know just really\nafter it getting after it and with most\nof them\nmost of them it's not even necessarily\nthe chemical dependency as much as with\ntheir body and their mind is telling\nthem is that first high that you got\nyou're gonna your body tries to chase\nthat your mind trying to chase that you\nchased it on a spiritual level for the\nrest of your life they call that chasing\nthe dragon now because of that that that\nexperience that you want to get back\nover and over again even if you keep\ngetting a diminished version of it you\nkeep chasing it over and over again what\na lot of men don't understand when you\ngo out with women when you deal with\nwomen if you can create that experience\nand that feeling\nand tag and tap into something\nemotionally one time have you ever\nnoticed that women would date a guy who\nhas doesn't seem like he has anything to\noffer that you're like why do you keep\ngoing back to this dude well they're\nchasing the dragon\nthat dude\nhe [ __ ] her really good and that's\npart of why she she keeps coming back\nand that's certainly part of the uh\nsmall amount a person it's just like\nwhat a girl okay but the worst piece of\n[ __ ] you ever have in your life is\nstill good\nbut how many guys do you know\nare chasing after a woman who hasn't\nslept with them in three four five six\nyears sometimes even more\nstill chasing still hoping man one day\nif I do this she'll come back one day if\nI do that she'll come back you might\neven look at the girls like she's not\neven really that attractive it probably\nwasn't even that good or that much\nbetter than the last woman but\nshe was somehow able to tap into an\nexperience an emotional connection that\nyou had and it hit all the factors in\nyour mind your body your spirit and\nbecause that happened you were going to\nchase that for as long as you possibly\ncan you're gonna you're chasing until\nyou have nothing left\nand what a lot of guys don't really\nunderstand it with guys who have game do\nunderstand I need to create an\nexperience and as many times as I can\ncreate that experience\nIt renews This Woman's attraction for me\nI don't need it to create it with money\nI don't need to create it by doing\nspectacular things that matter so much\nit's just I need to find out what makes\nthat woman Tink and I need to create\nthat experience some guys created in a\nnegative way\nsometimes how do they figure that out I\nimagine\nyou can't just ask directly because a\nlot of people actually don't know\nwhat what they really want do you think\nthat's true\nabsolutely it's true when you talk okay\nthe way um it's like um I actually sold\ncars in a couple of different items my\nfather I always say this my father's the\ngreatest salesman ever believe\num and he got the plaques and everything\nto prove it he taught me a lot of stuff\nabout sales and one of the biggest\nthings is\nto sell somebody something you got to\nreally listen\nnot just listen to what they tell you\nbut also listen to what they don't tell\nyou\nso when you look at somebody and you say\nyou get it say you get a life a nice\ngirl that you you find attractive you're\njust like what makes this girl tick I\ndon't understand this woman what is it\nthat I need to know about her that that\nthese are the things that make that\nmatter the most to her\nwell when you want to figure that out\nabout somebody\ndon't ask them what the most important\nthings are ask them about other things\nhey you know what's your favorite movie\nfigure out what movie they like to go\nsee do they like to go see romantic\ncomedies\nwell that means that they want a lot of\ntimes they want that up and down\nuh Boy Meets Girl boy loses girl love\nstory\num\nso a lot of times like if you watch a\nguy who likes Spider-Man\nhe wants that story about the nerd who\nmeets a girl that's the love of his life\nhe finally gets super powers you get\nwhat I'm saying you can tell a lot about\na guy by that\nso that basically kind of goes on the\npsychological premise of identification\nthat that's kind of how movies work and\nstories work\nidentify with certain characters and\nthat's easier to do than others and\nmaybe we identify\num almost wishfully like with the people\nthat we most want to be or would like\nmost to be and if we're good at kind of\nanalyzing those themes or that work we\ncan kind of reverse engineer a person's\nself-concept or or what their yeah\ndesire might be that's interesting\nbecause because what we normally what we\nnormally identify with the most is\nsomebody who is the closest to us\ntransformed into the best version of us\nso when we watch a movie or a show or\nsomething like that it's normally going\nto be the thing like if you like like\nlook at Rocky\nRocky's not perfect Rocky's kind of slow\nwitted\num doesn't talk very intelligently he's\npoor he's not doesn't have a great\nrecord as a fighter he's somebody who\nyou say wow this guy's you know he's\nkind of a loser he gets this opportunity\nthis chance\nout of nowhere where Apollo Creed says\nhey I'll fight you and\nthe transformation that Rocky takes he\nhas a he has a mentor and you got to\nlook and you gotta pay attention to\nevery piece of the story he has a mentor\nthat comes in and trains and changes him\ninto the person that could actually\nfight Apollo Creed and be successful\nenough to go down to the last second\nRocky loses in the end but Rocky becomes\nsomebody you can Empire\nthat wasn't very popular I mean clearly\nthere was\na dozen sequels but I think he wins in\nevery other movie it's almost like\npeople couldn't let the story end with\nRocky losing\nthat's that's another thing that people\ndon't think about when they think about\nrelationships why do a lot of women go\nback to a guy who doesn't call them why\nthey call over and over again it's the\nCliffhanger the story didn't win the way\nthat I want to people chase the happy\nending just like they did with Rocky\nthey knew when they made Rocky lose that\nfight that you would be so happy to go\nsee Rocky too\nthey knew it"
