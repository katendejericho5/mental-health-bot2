    "video_title": "The TERRIFYING divorce rate",
    "transcript": "why most marriages fail we know that the\ndivorce rate is extremely high in the\nWestern World more than half of\nmarriages end in divorce which should be\nan absolutely terrifying statistic for\nany single man in the west the reasons\nbehind this exorbitant divorce rate are\nwidely debated and hotly contested and\nthere's a good deal of validity to a lot\nof these points however I have a very\nsimple explanation that cuts to the\nheart of the issue here it is the reason\nwhy most marriages fail is because\nmarriage is inherently a very humble\ninstitution and because of its\nfundamental humility it cannot support\nall the extra that people are subject to\npiling on top of that institution\nmarriage is just not designed to support\nmore than what it was built to do and at\nthe end of the day when a marriage was\nbuilt to do is to provide a context for\npeople to come together and raise\nchildren"
