    "video_title": "SCIENTISM vs  KNOW-HOW",
    "transcript": "I'm much less interested in what is\nfactually accurate than what is\nmeaningfully true appreciation of this\ndifference leads to two very different\nconceptualizations of science on the one\nhand you have the cult of scientism this\nbelief system is usually practiced by\npeople who have enough knowledge to know\nthat they know some things but not\nenough knowledge to know that they know\nvery little this particular combination\ncan make them very proud on the other\nhand you have the eminently more useful\nconceptualization of science as know-how\nthe ability to do the thing if you can\nexplain it but you can't do it then you\nhave a scientistic understanding if you\ncan do it but you can't explain it then\nyou have a know-how understanding both\nare forms of science but know-how is\nhigher it's the difference between\nextrapolating the laws of aerodynamics\nand building an airplane that flies\nideally we use the former to do the\nlatter but that is not strictly\nnecessary"
