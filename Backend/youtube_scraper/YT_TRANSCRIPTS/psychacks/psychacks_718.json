    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic today short talk is how to be a\nman\nit's a simple question and one that 100\nyears ago would be ludicrous to ask\nbecause back then everyone just sort of\nknew what the answer was but here we are\nin modern times characterized among\nother things by an identity crisis in\nmen how we got here is extremely complex\nbut here is where we are\nnow some forms of masculinity such as\nmachismo masculinity are fairly complex\nthis is because they are performances of\nan Unwritten etiquette with evolving\nrules and standards\nhowever this form of masculinity as much\nas fem femininity is essentially\nperformative\nneither is a natural Suite of behaviors\nand each is an expression of a\nparticular time and place these forms of\nmasculinity and femininity can be\nlearned and skillful execution of their\nrespective Suites of behaviors both\nExpress and confirm status in men and\nwomen\nmany of the answers you'll hear on the\ninternet to the question of how to be a\nman correspond with performative\nmasculinity\nthere are things that you can do to\nsignify your man's status with props\ncostumes and postures\nthese could be things like grow a beard\nlift heavy stuff start a business go\nfishing go hunting learn to start a fire\nlearn to drive a manual transmission\nlearn to seduce women learn to fight\nlearn to shoot a gun learn to grill a\nribeye steak talk knowledgeably about\nsports drink beer and appreciate whiskey\nEtc\nnow I don't have a problem with any of\nthose things a lot of them sound fun and\ncould prove beneficial to the individual\nin question however I do think that all\nof those responses suffer from defining\nmasculinity essentially as a suite of\nbehaviors as a performance\nnow I have a different take on this\nquestion as you can see\nI'm not a guy who's very performatively\nmasculine\nI work with words in a very feminized\nprofession I've never played football or\nscaled a fish or rope to calf\nhowever when it comes down to it I'm\nextremely masculine\nand this is because what it means to be\na man is very simple\nand only marginally associated with what\nyou do or what you look like\nare you ready\nto be a man is very simple\nyou need only two things\nyou need a spine\nand you need some balls\nthat's it\nif you have a spine and you have some\nballs then you're a man\nand just so we're clear I'm not talking\nliterally all humans have a spine and\nall males have balls what I'm talking\nabout is a spine and a pair figuratively\nit's simple but not necessarily easy\nlet's talk about each one individually\nshall we first what does it mean to have\na spine\nspine means that you are willing to\nstand up\nanatomically you need a spine to stand\nerect figuratively you need a spine to\nstand up for what you believe to be true\nwhich is in your heart of hearts Who You\nAre\nin this of course presupposes that you\nactually know what you believe to be\ntrue and this ain't easy\nmost of the things in your head were put\nthere by other people and a lot of that\nstuff is total garbage\nfor most people it takes years and years\nof patient self-study to learn what they\nbelieve to be true\nso young guys get a pass here though\nit's important to acknowledge that we\ntend to make their jobs Harder by\nfilling them up with so much distracting\nnonsense to begin with\nhowever there are many older guys men\nwho I speak with on a regular basis who\ndon't know what their values are\ndon't know what they believe to be true\nand consequently don't know who the\nthey are\nand how are you going to stand up for\nsomething if you don't know what that\nsomething is\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and if you're liking what\nyou're hearing you can hit the super\nthanks button it's those three little\ndots in the lower right hand corner and\ntip me in proportion to the value you\nbelieve you've received from this\nepisode I really appreciate your support\nnow having a spine also lets you know\nwhere you stand in relation to the\nuniverse\nthis is because as soon as you stand up\nyou cast a shadow which situates you in\na specific Place between the heavens\nliterally the Sun and the Earth your\nimmediate surroundings\nunless you are completely in line with\nthe light there is no way to avoid\ncasting a shadow on this plane\namong other things this means that as\nsoon as you stand up that is as soon as\nyou make it known who you are and what\nyou believe in\nyou will attract an antithetical element\nin opposition to that the shadow\npeople will disagree with you people\nwill disapprove of you some people will\ndespise you and the taller you stand the\nmore some people will threaten attack\nand seek to destroy you\nthis is part of the risk of standing up\nand having a spine and this of course is\nwhy we rightly respect people who stand\nup for what is Right despite the\npersonal risk of doing so\nwhat's strange is that the alternative\nto doing this that is remaining\nspineless isn't all that great either\nyou go through life never really knowing\nwho you are and what you believe in\nnow it often happens that some people do\nknow who they are and do know what they\nbelieve in\nhowever they're never able to find their\nplace in the world\nbecause they weren't willing to stand up\nfrom their hiding places and say\nthis is me\nthis is because doing so requires the\nsecond ingredient\na pair of balls\nhaving a pair means that you're willing\nto suffer the risk associated with being\nsomebody\na specific individual with values and\nbeliefs it means putting your money\nwhere your mouth is it means not giving\na whether you agree with me or\ndisagree with me not giving a\nwhether you approve or disapprove of me\nnot giving a if you love or hate me\nit means if necessary putting your money\nyour relationships your career your\nstatus your reputation and even your\nlife on the line in the service of what\nyou believe to be true\nif you have a spine with no balls you\nspend your life hiding hiding from your\nfriends hiding from your women and\nultimately hiding from yourself\nwell you technically can't do anything\nto earn respect in the sense that you\ncannot make someone respect you\nespecially if for whatever reason they\nhave a mind not to you can significantly\nincrease the probability that you will\nGarner respect from other men and from\nwomen in general by having a spine and\ngrowing a pair\nwe respect those who are willing to hold\nthe line and stand up for what they\nbelieve in regardless of the\nconsequences\nparadoxically we like those who don't\nseem to care whether we like them or not\non the other hand we typically have\nneither respect nor appreciation for\nthose who do things so that we might\nlike them\nlet's recap if you know who you are what\nyou believe to be true\nand if you're willing to stand up and\nrisk it all in the service of those\nbeliefs\nin the service of your mission then\ncongratulations my friend you are a man\nyou do not need to grow a beard\nyou do not need to hunt or care about\nfootball or drink everyone under the\ntable or plow through half the women in\ntown\nyou need a spine and some balls if you\nhave all the other things but you don't\nhave a spine and some balls then you're\nnot a man in my opinion and if you have\nnone of those other things but you do\nhave a spine and some balls then you're\na full-fledged man\nhopefully that clears some things up\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience please let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you may also consider becoming a\nchannel member with perks like priority\nreview of comments or booking a paid\nconsultation\nas usual\nthank
