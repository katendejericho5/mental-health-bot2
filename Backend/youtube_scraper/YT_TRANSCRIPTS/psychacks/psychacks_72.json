    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psycha\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women\nhave to allow themselves to be\nused this one is for the ladies a\nprovocative title I'll admit but I hope\nthe episode justifies its usage let's\nget right to it ladies it's my\nunderstanding that one of your primary\nconcerns about modern dating especially\nin an age where sex precedes a\ncommitment is that you will be used that\nis you might enter into a sexual\nrelationship with a particular man\nhowever this might not lead to the\nrelationship outcome you would prefer\nmaybe you're ghosted afterward or you\nenter into a vague situationship that\ndoesn't seem to go anywhere and women\nare subject to considering these\noutcomes to be exploitative or a waste\nof their time and I'm here to address\nthis concern and help you navigate this\nreality successfully to reduce the\nlikelihood of this occurring there are\nthree things you have to do the first is\nexercise appropriate discernment like\nthere are guys out there who will never\ngive you the relationship outcome you\nwould prefer no matter what you do ever\nso you need to get better at figuring\nout who these guys are simply asking men\nwhat are you looking for is stupid and\nineffective it is stupid and ineffective\nbecause both the man who who lies and\nthe man who tells the truth will say the\nsame thing I'm looking for a long-term\nrelationship men have learned long ago\nthat you punish any other response to\nthis question more on that in a future\nepisode so ultimately this is a problem\nthat you created for yourselves if you\npunish the truth you're asking to be\nlied to it's not a very popular opinion\nbut I'd like you to consider that it's\nnot men's respons responsibility to be\nhonest and transparent with you like\nthey shouldn't outright lie but you also\nshouldn't expect that they're going to\nlike tell you everything either I want\nyou to consider that it's not their job\nto tell you the truth it's your job to\nfigure out the truth just like it's\ntheir job to vet you it's your job to\nvet them and if you can't get better at\nDiscerning the opportunities that are\nlikely to lead to the outcome you would\nprefer that I'm afraid you're just going\nto run into the same issue over and over\nand over again we all make mistakes and\nto a certain extent we all have to learn\nthe hard way but it's like learn your\nlesson and make different mistakes\nmoving\nforward consider this problem from a\nprofessional standpoint wanting to get\nmarried to a high value guy is kind of\nlike wanting to be the CEO of a\nsuccessful company lots of people want\nit the vast majority of them will be\ndisappointed in their wanting\nif you get hired at a certain company\nthere is typically no assurance that you\nwill ever become the CEO even if you\nwork your ass off for 40 straight years\nthere is absolutely no guarantee that\nyou will end up in the seite and\ngenerally no company will guarantee that\noutcome when they hire you but you sign\nup for the job anyway and you generally\nsign up for the job because you like the\ncompensation package at the position for\nwhich you were hired\nand this means that even if you never\nget promoted to CEO you also can't\nreally complain that you were exploited\nas you were compensated for your time at\nthe rate you agreed to otherwise you\nprobably wouldn't have accepted the\nposition now you're going to have better\nchances at career advancement at some\ncompanies over others aren't you however\nboth types of companies will generally\ntell you that they offer growth\nopportunities during the interview\nprocess so if being the CEO one day is\nvery important to you then you have to\nuse your discernment to figure out which\ntype of company you're dealing with this\nis because no company ever will tell you\nthat they're hiring for a dead-end job\nwhile they're still in the hiring\nprocess okay now before I go any further\nif you're liking what you're hearing\nplease consider sending this episode to\nsomeone who might benefit from

mentioned are in the description\nokay\nlet's get back to\nit now this Segways into the second\nthing that you ladies have to do in the\nabsence of an explicit guarantee that\nyou will become the\nCEO how do you increase the likelihood\nthat this will one day occur as the\nemployee you're not going to get there\nby making demands or insisting on\ncommitments you're going to increase the\nlikelihood that you'll get promoted by\nshowing up and doing your job\nreally really\nwell every single day for as many days\nin a row as you can possibly\nmuster\notherwise you're acting deluded and\nentitled like in a professional context\nimagine believing you can get promoted\nwithout exceeding\nexpectations or thinking you only have\nto work for a few months before you get\na corner office the CEO is a very high\nposition and lots of people want it to\nthe extent that it's in demand you\nincrease the likelihood of winning that\nposition by\noverpaying which means doing your job\nreally really really well just keep in\nmind that your job isn't really what you\nthink your job is it's what your boss\nthinks your job is it's your boss\nnot you who decides if you exceeded\nexpectations and put in the appropriate\neffort remember the cat decides what\nmilk is\ngood however let's not be naive the\nworld is not a meritocracy the position\ndoesn't always go to the most capable\nand sometimes people who do good work\nget passed over and this leads us to the\nthird thing that women can do namely\nplay their cards right if you're\nshooting for the SE Suite then you have\nto be willing to play The Game of\nThrones if not then set your sight lower\nor go find a less successful company\nwhere the competition is lower I talk\nmore about how to do this in my\nforthcoming book the value of others and\nmy video series on how to get any man\nyou want in any case those are the three\nthings you have to do ladies to secure\nyour commitment you have to exercise\nyour discernment you have to do your job\nreally really well and you have to play\nyour cards right make\nsense now let's focus on step two for a\nmoment to do your job really well this\nis true of anyone men and women to do\nyour job really well you have to allow\nyourself to be used there is no way\naround it if you don't allow your\nemployer or your customers to use you to\nuse your time or your service or your\nexpertise then you cannot expect to get\nwhat you want from them a highly skilled\nworker who does not allow herself to be\nused is\nuseless and useless things typically\naren't very valuable the potential\ndoesn't count for anything the fact that\nyou could if you wanted to is\nmeaningless if you don't and it's\nusually the case that you have to allow\nyourself to be used in advance of\ngetting what you want kind of like how\nyou have to work two weeks before you\nreceive a paycheck and this means that\nthere's always a chance that you'll put\nin the effort and not get what you want\nafter all no one really likes this like\neverybody men and women would just\nprefer to be given what they wanted and\neverybody men and women are acutely\naware of the possibility that they won't\nget what they hope to receive for\ninstance I've spoken with hundreds of\nguys who don't want to date women\nanymore because they think that women\nare just using them for their resources\nand there are women out there who\nabsolutely use men for their resources\nat every level of the relationship\nfunnel\nand there is no guarantee that the next\nwoman they go out with isn't going to do\nthe same however there's really not a\nway around this if men don't allow\nthemselves to be used they rarely get a\nchance to access women's sexual\nopportunities this is because all men\npay it is what it is however just like\nwomen can get better at using their\ndiscernment and identifying the men\nunlikely to give them their preferred\nrelationship outcome men can get better\nat using their discernment and\nidentifying the women likely to Simply\nuse them for resources it works both\nways now in my experience men have kind\nof made their peace with the necessity\nof being used this is because the world\ntreats useless men very badly so they're\nkind of used to it women not so much\nHowever the fact of the matter is that\nin today's sexual Marketplace you have\nto allow yourself to be used women in\norder to get what you want\nand you may need to allow yourselves to\nbe used longer than you might expect\nthis isn't your parents let alone your\ngrandparents generation when it comes to\nsex it is a buyer's market not a sellers\none this means that you might have to\nwork longer and harder than you think\nyou should just to get your foot in the\ndoor like think of the fashion industry\nis it right is it fair that people work\nfor years as UNP paid interns with no\nguarantee of succcess in order to launch\ntheir careers right or wrong it's what's\nrequired given prevailing Market forces\nthere's so many people who want in that\nindustry and there's only so many jobs\nit's for you to decide whether it's\nworth it not for you to decide what is\nnecessary for better or worse there is\nonly one way for women today to secure\nthe commitment they might want without\nallowing themselves to be used if they\ndon't want to be used they can be\nornamental however in order to be\nornamental you have to be really really\nreally pretty and just keeping it real\nwith you by definition the vast majority\nof you are not really really really\npretty so you're not going to be\nornamental and you might not want to be\nanyway because what does an ornament do\nhaha trick question nothing it's not\nsupposed to do anything it's just\nsupposed to keep quiet and testify to\nthe status of its owner not a\nparticularly flattering position in\nreality in any case in today's sexual\nMarketplace securing commitment from a\nhigh value man is comparable to becoming\nthe CEO of a successful company to get\neither you have to use your discernment\nto pick your appropriate opportunity you\nhave to do your job really really really\nwell and you have to play your cards\nright and the way to actualize all three\nof these things is to allow yourselves\nto be be used you got to give to get and\nmost of you ain't going to get anywhere\nunless you give it up\nhundo what do you think does this fit\nwith your own experience let me know in\nthe comments below as always I\nappreciate your support and thank you\nfor listening and now a word about\nStellar if you're interested in
