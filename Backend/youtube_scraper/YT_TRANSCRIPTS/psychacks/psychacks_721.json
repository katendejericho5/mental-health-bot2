    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychack's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is why women monkey branch\nif you are unfamiliar with the term\nmonkey branching is the phenomenon in\nwhich a woman leaves one relationship\nand very quickly enters into another and\ngenerally the gap between relationships\nis so small as to preclude the\npossibility that she didn't already have\nthe second relationship lined up before\nshe pulled the trigger on the first\nhence monkey branching in which the\nmonkey doesn't let go of the first Vine\nuntil she has a firm grip on the second\nnow almost all men have had this happen\nto them at some point in their lives and\nit can be though it doesn't necessarily\nhave to be a painful experience\nhowever as with much having to do with\nwomen understanding can do much to\nmitigate the pain today I'm going to\nexplain to you why this phenomenon is so\nprevalent which should help you to\naccept reality and move forward\nfirst if you haven't done so already I\nwould highly encourage you to check out\nmy episode women treat men the way men\ntreat jobs because that will provide the\nappropriate context for the following\ntalk now if it is true that women treat\nmen the way men treat jobs then we have\nto enter into let's say a corporate\nframe of mind\nwhen attempting to understand female\nmating and dating behavior and if you've\never worked in the corporate world you\nknow that the biggest jumps in\ncompensation that you're likely to\nreceive over the course of your career\ndon't occur when you're promoted within\na company but when you lateral to a\ndifferent company\nthe same is true in dating and there are\nmany rational principles in play that\nconspire to create these incentives\nlet's go through a few of them\nwhen you're initially hired at a company\nthe process is usually protracted\njust like in dating these conversations\ncan occur over several months as both\nparties are kind of trying to figure out\nwhether they can do business what that\nwould look like and how they can\nnegotiate the best deal for themselves\nthis is because despite the fact that\nboth parties need each other there is a\nfundamental antagonism between their\naims namely management wants as much\nwork for as little money as possible and\nlabor wants as much money for as little\nwork as possible\nand so long as these classes exist this\nwill never change\nby the same token all things being equal\nmen want as much sex and freedom for as\nlittle time energy and money as possible\nand women want as much time energy and\nmoney for as little sex and freedom as\npossible\nbehind all the fun and excitement the\ncourtship phase of a relationship just\nlike an extended hiring process is\nbasically two people figuring out what\nkind of business they can do together\nand negotiating what they're willing to\ngive up for what they expect to receive\nin return\npeople will balk at this but that's the\nway it is it often doesn't seem like\nit's the way it is because just like in\nbusiness negotiating too explicitly is\ngauche like if you want a job you can't\ntell your potential employer look I\ncould care less about your mission and\nyour culture you're going to use my\nskills to increase your profit and I'm\ngoing to use your brand to increase my\nincome and if I'm going to trade my time\nfor money I want as much money as I can\nget and since I have a few other offers\nwhat I want to know is can you give me a\nbetter deal because all things being\nequal I'm going to go with the\norganization that pays me the most\nyou're going to come off as mercenary\nand sociopathic but that doesn't\nnecessarily mean that that is not the\nsubtext of hiring negotiations\nalso keep in mind that any company that\nshamed a potential employee for\nprioritizing the bottom line would only\ndo so tactically like because it's in\ntheir best interest to do so\nas making employees believe that they\nshould work for things other than money\nallows companies to functionally receive\nthe same amount of labor for a smaller\nexpenditure of money which increases\ntheir profit but yeah I digress\nin any case once this protracted\nnegotiation is finalized that is once\nyou decide how much money you're willing\nto receive to compensate for the\nexpenditure of your time you're going to\nbe anchored at that level as long as you\nremain at that company\nthis means that it's going to be very\nvery hard to get a large raise at that\ncompany because all raises will be\nproportional increases from that\nnegotiated price point you can get five\npercent here ten percent there but you\nwon't ever double your money by\nremaining loyal\nthat will only occur if you successfully\nnegotiate a different anchor at a new\ncompany\nbig bumps in comp don't happen\ninternally they happen laterally the\nsame is true for relationships big bumps\nin title and lifestyle generally don't\nhappen internally they happen laterally\nand on the occasions they do occur\ninternally they generally occur in order\nto retain someone who has received a\nbetter offer elsewhere and is willing to\nleave\njust keeping it real\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow you may also consider\nhitting the super thanks button it's\nthose three little dots in the lower\nright hand corner and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this message\nthose donations keep this channel going\nand I really appreciate your support\nnow all this kind of begs the question\nif the first company can buy an\nemployee's labor for X dollars why would\nsome other company pay 1.5 x dollars for\nthe same labor I will tell you why\nthe reason why the second company is\nwilling to pay significantly more for a\npoached employee is that on a longer\ntime frame this strategy is cheaper for\nthe company than developing its own\nTalent\nhow does that work well if a company\nwere to hire someone from scratch\nwithout any real experience and without\nany real proof of ability then that\ncompany is running a risk\nafter investing in their training and\ndevelopment many of these employees\ndon't pan out in the long run or they\nsimply lateral to other companies once\nthey have been trained and developed and\nunless you run a company that\nintentionally grinds through unskilled\ntemporary labor this approach to hiring\nwill likely prove expensive or even\nunsustainable\non the other hand an employee that has\nalready been trained has already been\ndeveloped and has already demonstrated\nproof of ability is much less of a risk\npoaching companies pay more because they\nhave functionally outsourced the due\ndiligence and training processes\nthis means that not only will there be\nless time energy and money wasted in\ncultivating employees that don't go the\ndistance but there will also be a lower\nlikelihood of future lateral movements\nas they are paying above market value\nfor the labor in question\nconsequently these companies pay more\nbecause it saves them time and buys them\nlonger loyalty but make no mistake they\nonly seem to pay more if churning\nthrough short-term employees weren't\nmore expensive they would do that\ninstead\nthe same is true in dating\nand this explains why we see monkey\nbranching far more commonly in women\nthan we do in men\nchurning through short-term\nrelationships is much more expensive for\nwomen than it is for men\nfurthermore demonstrated proof of\ncompetence and ability in men is much\nmore attractive to women than\ndemonstrated proof of sexual\navailability and experience in women is\nto men\na woman who has been trained and\ndeveloped elsewhere is less appealing to\nmen than one who has not\nat this point you might be saying okay\nOrion well all that makes sense but why\ndo women have to do this from within\ntheir current relationship why don't\nthey have the Integrity to break things\noff with the first man before they go\nlooking for the second\nI will explain this to you this is\nbecause just like in business it would\nbe incredibly stupid to quit your job\nbefore you have another opportunity\nlined up\nand this is true for two reasons first\nit's stupid because you don't actually\nknow how long you will remain unemployed\nbecause whether you are hired isn't up\nto you so unless you are independently\nwealthy you may not be able to float the\nemployment gap if the market is\ninhospitable and if you are\nindependently wealthy why are you\nlooking for a job\nand second it's stupid because you will\nbe able to negotiate a more competitive\nsalary at your next position if you both\na retain proof of your employability and\nB have another confirmed bidder for your\nlabor your current employer\nand once again the same is true in\ndating\nthese reasons in conjunction with the\nfact that women generally have\nrelationship goals whereas men do not\nand the fact that women operate under\nshorter time Horizons than men do are\nsufficient to explain not only monkey\nbranching behavior in general but also\nits increased prevalence in women\nrelative to men in particular\njust one final word men if this happens\nto you don't take it personally King\nwhen women do this you have to\nunderstand that it's just business\nbut you might also consider that you're\nbeing given a gift\nwhy well think about it when were you\nmost loyal and committed and\nhard-working when you first join the\ncompany\nor when you've been working there for\nseveral years\nwhen you first joined of course when you\ntake on new Talent they are generally\nthrilled at the opportunity to be there\non the other hand you may end up paying\nmore and more just to keep a disgruntled\nemployee from leaving\npeople price themselves out of\nrelationships all the time\nlet the new guy over bid for your used\nmerchandise\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to
