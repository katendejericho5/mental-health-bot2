    "transcript": "it's my theory that the expenditure of\ncognitive resources is related to the\nsubjective experience of time meaning\nthe fewer cognitive resources are\napplied to processing less information\nthe faster time seems to progress in\nthis way a night's sleep can seem to\npass in a few moments of unconsciousness\nand those who fall into a coma are often\nshocked to learn that months or years\nhave passed these of course are extreme\nexamples but they do Accord with the\ngeneral rule level of cognitive\nprocessing is inversely correlated with\nthe subjective passage of time therefore\nto combat the acceleration of the\nsubjective passage of time you will want\nto increase the amount of time spent\nutilizing more of your cognitive\nresources in bottom-up processing you\ncan do this by increasing danger or\nchallenge improving your mindfulness\npractice and combating busyness in your\nday-to-day life do this and you'll have\ntwice as much life without living an\nextra day"
