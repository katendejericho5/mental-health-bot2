    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of a day's short talk is why time\nseems to move faster as we age this was\nsomething that had long been mysterious\nto me but today I'm going to share my\npersonal Theory with respect to why this\nis the case\nI believe that the subjective\nacceleration of the passage of time is\nlargely a consequence of the overuse of\ntop-down cognitive heuristics as we age\nokay let's do a quick review of what all\nthat means so there's kind of two ways\nthat human beings can perceive reality\nwe can perceive it bottom up or we can\nperceive it top down\nwhat does that mean bottom-up processing\nmeans that we form our perceptions of\nreality from raw sensory data collection\nwith few to know preconceptions of what\nwe are perceiving children for instance\ncan't help but be bottom-up processors\nsince they've never encountered much of\nwhat they're experiencing before they\ndon't have many preconceptions of that\nphenomena that's why when they're\npresented with something new they try to\nget as much raw sensory information as\nthey can they look at it from different\nangles they smell it they put it in\ntheir mouth they throw it around they\nrattle it next to their ears children\nare very curious about novel phenomena\nthis allows children to have let's say a\nmore direct experience with reality than\nmost adults and this is partly why\nchildren tend to be more emotional than\nadults as the experience of reality in\nadults is mediated through their\nconceptual Frameworks which tends to\nremove them somewhat from direct contact\nwith reality mitigating their emotional\nresponsiveness however since children\ntend to lack those conceptual Frameworks\ntheir sensory experience is translated\ndirectly into emotional reactivity\nwithout any mitigating factors\nOver time however humans kind of can't\nhelp but rely more and more on top down\ntop down processing we get better at\nperceiving reality so we need less raw\nsensory data from which to extrapolate\nour conceptual Frameworks most adults\naren't really paying attention\nthey're just paying enough attention for\ntheir top-down processing to kick in\nafter which the blanks left by an\nabsence of sensory data are filled in\nwith what they expect to experience\nin this way most adults are not\ngenerally engaging with reality but with\ntheir own extrapolated models of reality\ngenerated through top-down processing\nthis allows them to move through life\nmore or less on autopilot which most\nhuman beings are doing don't believe me\njust go to the grocery store and look\naround most people are just going\nthrough the motions but their minds are\nsomewhere else entirely and this is a\nfascinating phenomenon because like\nthese are their lives people will fight\nfor one more day of life but they're not\neven present for that life most of the\ntime\nwhy wouldn't people pay more attention\nwell before I answer that question if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow and you can also hit the\nsuper thanks button and tip me in\nproportion to the value you feel you've\nreceived from this episode I really\nappreciate your support\nwell the reason why people increasingly\nadopt a top-down processing style is\nbecause it saves so much time and energy\nrelative to bottom-up processing think\nabout it it would be really really hard\nto get anything done if we approached\nevery phenomenon like an infant action\nwould be difficult and inefficient if we\nhad to reinvent the wheel at every\nmoment because we weren't able to make\ncertain perceptual assumptions this\nisn't a conscious Choice the mind just\nkind of decides to take shortcuts so it\ncan free up those cognitive resources\nfor other tasks this is top down\nprocessing\nnow it's my theory that the expenditure\nof cognitive resources is related to the\nsubjective experience of time\nI think we all kind of understand this\nrelationship from a purely mechanistic\nperspective like when does time move\nmore quickly when you're relaxing on the\ncouch or sprinting on the treadmill\nwell\nI think the same is true with respect to\ncognitive resources meaning the fewer\ncognitive resources are applied to\nprocessing less information\nthe faster time seems to progress\nin this way a night's sleep can seem to\npass in a few moments of unconsciousness\nand those who fall into a coma are often\nshocked to learn that months or years\nhave passed these of course are extreme\nexamples but they do Accord with the\ngeneral rule level of cognitive\nprocessing is inversely correlated with\nthe subjective passage of time\nanother extreme example that illustrates\nthis is a near-death experience this is\nbecause almost everyone can be jolted\ninstantaneously into bottom-up\nprocessing by the sudden imposition of\nnovelty or danger\nthis has been the case in my own\nexperience I've had a couple of\nnear-death experiences in my life one of\nwhich involved getting swept up in a\nriver crossing in Kings Canyon National\nPark\ntime was flowing regularly like it\nalways did until the instant I lost my\nfeet and I was swept up in the currents\ninstantly time slowed dramatically like\nthe river was barely moving I could see\ndrops of water suspended in midair as\nthey arced across the sky while the\ninternal experience of my thoughts\nremained unchanged\nI felt like I had all this time to take\nin my situation and make a decision as\nto how best to get out of it though I\nimagine the whole experience only lasted\na few seconds\nthis was not something that I\nconsciously did I had just never been\nswept up by a river before so the\nnovelty of that experience effortlessly\nswitched me over to bottom up processing\nwhich allowed me to pay very close\nattention to the actual experience\ncircumstances I was in not the\ncircumstances I thought I was in but the\nactual circumstances I was in and that\nperceptual overdrive slowed down my\nexperience of time and this seems to be\na common experience among those who have\npassed through similar situations\nso how do we combat the acceleration of\nthe subjective passage of time without\nrisking Our Lives well in the first\nplace you might consider responsibly\ninjecting some danger into your life I\nmade an episode on that a long time ago\nincreasing the stakes generally wakes\npeople up however another way to do this\nis to practice mindfulness\nyou can do this in a sitting meditation\nbut the stuff of your life is actually\nbetter material for mindfulness practice\nyou can practice while you're working\nyou can practice while you're driving\nyou can even practice while you're at\nthe grocery store this is because\nmindfulness is functionally a bottom-up\nprocessing exercise in which you learn\nto pay closer attention to the actual\nmoment-to-moment experience of your\nConsciousness for longer periods of time\nthe more you practice mindfulness the\nmore you will train your mind to be able\nto flexibly adopt a bottom-up processing\nmodality which should slow the\nsubjective experience of time\nfinally you can experiment with doing\nless\ntime moves faster the busier you are\nthere are a lot of people out there who\nare shocked shocked that it's may\nalready and we're almost halfway through\n2023 and where does that time go\nthe biggest enemy of mindfulness is not\nlaziness it's not ignorance it's\nbusyness\nand busyness is the decision to mistake\nthe ten thousand insignificant things\nthat you have to do every day as\nactually important\nbe real with yourself is anyone going to\ndie if that doesn't get done\nis the world going to fall apart\nchoose busyness as a lifestyle and your\nlife will pass you by I guarantee it\ntherefore to combat the acceleration of\nthe subjective passage of time you will\nwant to increase the amount of time\nspent utilizing more of your cognitive\nresources in bottom-up processing you\ncan do this by increasing danger or\nchallenge\nimproving your mindfulness practice and\ncombating busyness in your day-to-day\nlife\ndo this and you'll have twice as much\nlife without living an extra day\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as
