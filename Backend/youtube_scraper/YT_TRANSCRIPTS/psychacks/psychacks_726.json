    "transcript": "players are almost always former nice\nguys it's after a significant heartbreak\nsometimes one sometimes several that\nthese guys due to their poor outcomes\nfinally get around to examining their\ncherished beliefs about women and\nrelationships and submit themselves to\nthat study of Effectiveness rigorously\nthe concept of Effectiveness is key as\nthese guys are tired of not getting what\nthey want and what works therefore has\nto Trump what they want to work or what\nthey think should work when it comes to\nwomen it's actually a fairly scientific\nmindset and we can think of players as\napplied behavioral scientists who study\nthe mating and dating behavior of women\nand like science it is best practiced\nwith a kind of value neutrality because\nboth players and scientists understand\nthat reality has no obligation to\nconform to our beliefs about how reality\nshould operate"
