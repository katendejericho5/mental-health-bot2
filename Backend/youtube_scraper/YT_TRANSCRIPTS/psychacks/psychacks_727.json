    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is where do\nplayers come from\nso the myth of the natural is just that\nit's a myth there are very very few men\nwho are naturally confident with women\nvery very few men effortlessly attract\nwomen how do I know this because in\nevery other domain of life nothing\nrequires more effort than seeming\neffortless\nso why would success with women be any\ndifferent the fact of the matter is that\nenjoying optionality with women requires\na significant amount of skill and while\nsome men's natural talents will dovetail\nnicely with this particular skill set\nwhich will help to explain the variants\nand outcomes we observe a skill set\nremains at the end of the day a suite of\nbehaviors that can be learned so if men\nwho enjoy significant success with women\nare not born but made the question\nbecomes how does this occur\nwhat are the circumstances that motivate\nmen to invest the time energy and money\nnecessary to acquire this skill set\nin general\nplayers are nice guys who got hurt one\ntoo many times and decided to do\nsomething about it\nplayers are almost always former nice\nguys and often former Romantics which as\nI've discussed many times on this\nchannel is an attitude toward life that\nalways ends in tragedy and it's only the\nintense pain associated with these\nexperiences that serves as sufficient\nmotivation to master a skill set that\nalmost by definition demands the learner\nundergo a substantial amount of personal\nrejection\nit's after a significant heartbreak\nsometimes one sometimes several that\nthese guys due to their patently poor\noutcomes finally get around to examining\ntheir cherished beliefs about women and\nrelationships and submit themselves to\nthat study of effectiveness rigorously\nthe concept of Effectiveness is key as\nthese guys are tired of not getting what\nthey want and what works therefore has\nto Trump what they want to work or what\nthey think should work when it comes to\nwomen it's actually a fairly scientific\nmindset and we can think of players as\napplied behavioral scientists who study\nthe mating and dating behavior of women\nand like science it is best practiced\nwith a kind of value neutrality because\nboth players and scientists understand\nthat reality has no obligation to\nconform to our beliefs about how reality\nshould operate\none of my all-time favorite movies is\nthe best cinematic example I know of\nthis phenomenon if people know the Hong\nKong film director Juan Kar y they are\nprobably familiar with what is generally\nconsidered his Masterpiece In the Mood\nfor Love It is currently ranked fifth on\nthe Sight and Sound critics poll the\ngreatest movies of all time people love\nthis movie and to be fair it is a really\nexcellent film\nhowever even fans of this movie\nSometimes don't know that Wong made a\nsequel to this film called 2046 which in\nmy opinion is even better\nlike its title suggests in the mood for\nlove is like a case study of a mood a\nparticular moment of life it's brilliant\nbut it's also kind of simple\n2046 on the other hand is much more\ncomplex and to my mind more honest if In\nthe Mood for Love is a still life then\n2046 is a symbolic allegory highly\nrecommended\nnow before I go any further to explain\nwhat this has to do with where players\ncome from if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nvideo to someone who might benefit from\nits message because it's Word of Mouth\nreferrals like this that really help to\nmake the channel grow and you can also\nhit the super thanks button it's in the\nlower right hand corner beneath the\nvideo those three little dots and tip me\nin proportion to the value you feel\nyou've received from this episode\nyour support goes a long way and I\nreally appreciate it\nin any case I feel comfortable\ndiscussing the main plot points of these\nmovies because the Artistry of the films\nis such that even if you know exactly\nwhat happens they are still worth\nwatching\nin In the Mood for Love Tony lung plays\na man named Chao who is married to a\nwoman to whom he is faithful and devoted\nhowever about a third of the way through\nthe movie he learns that his wife is\nhaving an affair with his next door\nneighbor's husband\ntwo of them Chao and his female neighbor\nSu Lee Chen kind of figure this out at\nthe same time and this creates an\nopportunity for the two to commiserate\nwith each other as they find themselves\nin the strange situation of knowing that\ntheir spouses are cheating on them with\neach other\nover time Chao ends up falling in love\nwith Suli Chen and this doesn't work out\nwell for him either because we learn\nthat she decides that she would rather\nremain faithful to her faithless husband\nthan start a new life with ciao this is\na real kick in the teeth for chow as he\nis functionally cucked twice by the same\nman whom we never see on camera\nthat is the same man successfully wooed\nChow's wife and successfully retained\nhis own wife's affections both Chow's\nwife and his neighbor prefer the\ncheating husband to him\nso ciao has his heart broken twice over\nthe course of the movie and this\npresumably causes him to question both\nhis life choices and his fundamental\nattitudes toward women and relationships\nand that's where In the Mood for Love\nends\nthe sequel 2046 picks up the story of\nCiao's life a few years later and he's\nalmost a completely different man he's\ngrown this little like Clark Gable\nmustache he dresses really slick and he\nas he confesses in the opening voice\nover narration he has a lot of one-night\nstands but hey nothing lasts forever\nanyway\nand this of course is the attitude of a\nman who has been significantly betrayed\nby women he thought he could trust his\nwife's commitment in marriage he\ncouldn't he thought he could trust a\nwoman's receptivity to his sincere love\nand affection he couldn't so rather than\nhave his heart broken again he Embraces\na world of temporary relationships and\nsuperficial interactions because hey at\nleast you can get some pleasure here for\na while and maybe that's the best we can\nreally hope for in life\nyou see this attitude most clearly in\nChow's relationship with bailing played\nby the beautiful Zhang ziyi who\nincidentally was Jen in Crouching Tiger\nHidden Dragon you know how much I love\nthat movie\nin one scene he discusses his pragmatic\nviews of relationships with her namely\nthat people just tend to borrow each\nother for a while and that makes sense\nhe used to believe in marriage turns out\nhis wife was just borrowing him for a\nwhile he used to believe in love turns\nout his neighbor was just borrowing him\nfor a while we can get mad we can get\nsad or we can accept that this is how it\nis\nwe just sort of use each other until we\ndon't and that is correct that is the\nnature of things and it's this\nindifference to the ephemerality of\nrelationships that tends to characterize\nmost players and that helps ciao pass\nthrough a series of gorgeous lovers\nthat said at the end of the day this is\na reactive position it's a defensive\nposture that more or less protects the\nindividual from falling back into the\nfallacies that leave him vulnerable to\npain and betrayal\nand we know this is a defensive posture\nfor child because we see occasional\ncracks in the facade for instance he\nplays it so cool with the fiery by Ling\nthat she ends up falling in love with\nhim and offers him a committed\nrelationship\nnow I believe that ciao fell in love\nwith Bai too at least to a certain\nextent but his player code his defensive\nposture clearly forbade him from going\ndown that path and in that scene he is\nlike shaking with self-restraint like it\ntakes every ounce of his strength to go\nagainst his emotions and tell by to get\nlost\nhe knows that he will lose by by doing\nso but he also knows that he will lose\nhimself if he doesn't\none of the many meanings of 2046 in the\nfilm is that it is the title of a\nscience fiction story that Chao is\nwriting about a man who tries to escape\nfrom a city where time stands still\nby analogy we can consider chao's\nvarious adventures with women as a\ncollective attempt to escape to move on\nfrom the standstill the trauma of his\nheart breaks\ndo check out both of these films as they\nare both excellent movies in their own\nright and faithful portrayals of men's\nreactions to romantic failure and\nbetrayal\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might
