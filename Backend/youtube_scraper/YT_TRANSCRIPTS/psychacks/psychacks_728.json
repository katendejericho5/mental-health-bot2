    "transcript": "I don't want to waste my time this is\nsomething that men generally hear from\nwomen the idea here is that from her\nperspective a relationship that doesn't\nhave a high likelihood of ending in\nmarriage and children is not worth\ninvesting in since her biological clock\nis ticking her time is an increasingly\nprecious resource and she can no longer\nspend it with men who are not prepared\nto give her what she wants I have a few\nunconventional takes on this topic I can\nbegin with the most obvious one namely\nit's not actually possible for someone\nelse to waste your time you can waste\nyour own time take one of these episodes\nfor instance even if I were to set out\nwith the explicit intention to waste\nyour time by say talking total nonsense\nI couldn't actually do it without your\nparticipation I couldn't force you to\nsit there and waste your time without\nyour consent externalizing\nresponsibility for that decision by\narguing I wasted your time because of my\ncontent or my intentions would be an\nabnegation of personal responsibility"
