    "transcript": "when I first started out I decided to\ngive this project enough time to succeed\nso that's the first takeaway here almost\neverything takes more time and effort\nthan you might expect and people don't\noften give themselves sufficient\nopportunity to achieve their goals and\nwhat is that opportunity well my rule of\nthumb is that it is due diligence time\n1.5 what does this mean well in this\ncase I spent an hour or two researching\nYouTube before I started out and I\ndiscovered that it could take 2 years\nfor a channel to get any kind of\ntraction on the platform so I decided to\ngive myself 3 years to succeed right\nthat's the 2 years suggested by my due\ndiligence times 1.5 or 50% more time\nthan what my research suggested I\nfigured that if I still could make it\nwork at 1.5x then I would have given it\na solid effort but I would probably need\nto re-evaluate my goals in my experience\nI've seen too many people quit too soon\nand I didn't want to be one of them this\nis kind of like accounting for penalty\ntime in a soccer game you have to expect\nthat the game will not end at regulation"
