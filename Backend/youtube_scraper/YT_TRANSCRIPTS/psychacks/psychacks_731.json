    "transcript": "the game does not run on gratitude\nremember a game is anything with rules\nand a goal so this statement is just as\ntrue in business as it is in Romance\nlisten very carefully as soon as you are\nno longer in a position to either\nbenefit or harm someone else you become\nirrelevant if you cannot help or hurt\nsomeone you are an NPC in that other\nperson's life you are wallpaper and your\nthoughts feelings and goals no longer\nmatter even if you have a long history\ntogether as soon as you remove those\ncontingencies the potential for future\nharm and the potential for future\nbenefits you can no longer expect to\ninfluence another person's Behavior you\ncan be upset about this you can lament\nthe state of humanity you can go on\nangry tirades about the way that things\nshould be but this is the way it is"
