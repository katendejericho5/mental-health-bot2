    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the game\ndoes not run on gratitude\nremember a game is anything with rules\nand a goal so this statement is just as\ntrue in business as it is in Romance the\ngame does not run on gratitude what does\nthis mean listen very carefully listen\ntwice if you need to as soon as you are\nno longer in a position to either\nbenefit or harm someone else\nyou become irrelevant\nif you cannot help or hurt someone you\nare an NPC in that other person's life\nyou are wallpaper and your thoughts\nfeelings and goals no longer matter\neven if you have a long history together\nas soon as you remove those\ncontingencies the potential for future\nharm and the potential for future\nbenefits you can no longer expect to\ninfluence another person's Behavior\nyou can be upset about this you can\nlament the state of humanity you can go\non angry tirades about men and women and\nthe way that things should be but this\nis the way it is the game does not run\non gratitude and why not\nbecause you've already been paid\nthis is something that's going to be\nvery hard for some of you to understand\nso I will walk you through it\nthe idea that you're owed something for\npast action especially something that\nhas not been explicitly and mutually\nnegotiated is rooted in an idea of\nfairness that frankly may only exist in\nyour mind\narticulated beliefs along these lines\ntypically begin with the words after\neverything I've done\nafter everything I've done for you after\neverything I've done for this company\nthis is how you repay me\nif you recognize this belief in yourself\nlet's take a look at this\nmore closely shall we\nlet's start with how this belief\noperates in career in business in this\ncase it should be fairly clear that the\nentire time that you were sacrificing\nyourself for the company you received a\npaycheck every two weeks and made use of\nthe perks and privileges associated with\nthe position as long as you are\nproviding a service\nyour responsibilities and compensation\nwere what you explicitly and mutually\nnegotiated with your employer and if you\nstopped receiving that compensation to\nwhich you were entitled for discharging\nyour responsibilities you would have\nstopped working\nanything that you may have expected\nbeyond your mutually negotiated\ncompensation existed only in your mind\nand you were given what you agreed to\nfor everything that you've done\nif you remain spiteful\nuh\neven in light of these facts it likely\nmeans that you agreed to something that\nyou didn't really want to do out of the\nhope that some future benefit might\naccrue to you even if that benefit was\njust continued loyalty\nmy friends loyalty is extraordinarily\nrare the vast majority of human\nrelationships are not governed by\nloyalty or fairness or gratitude or\nkindness or any other virtue or ideal\nthey are governed by power\nwhich is the ability to either give\npeople what they want or don't want or\nwithhold from people what they want or\ndon't want\nit's the ability to implement benefit\nand harm\nwhen you can no longer benefit or harm\nsomeone else you have no power in the\nrelationship and so you surrender your\nonly real chance of ever getting what\nyou want\nbut before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nit's those three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner beneath the\nscreen and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you've received from this\nepisode that helps make this all happen\nand I really appreciate your support\nnow all of this remains true in Romance\nafter everything I've done for you is\nthe rallying Cry of frustrated and\nresentful men and women the world over\nhowever just like in business this\nbelief is irrational because you've\nalready been paid for everything that\nyou've done\njust like no one is so selflessly\ndevoted to a company that they will keep\nshowing up for work if the paychecks\nstop there are very few people who will\nremain loyal to a relationship in which\nthe transmission of benefit has long\nsince ceased and we generally pity those\nwho choose to remain so\nand what did you get out of that\nrelationship for everything that you did\nwell it's different for every\nrelationship but it generally includes\nsome combination of things like dates\ncompanionship sex attention excitement\ncommiseration support emotional energy\ndistraction remedy from loneliness Etc\nand more than all of these you were\nthere\nyou were present in a person's life and\nwere able to accompany them through time\nfor a while\nyou were paid with some or all of these\nthings adopting a hurt or martyring\nattitude because you will not receive\nfurther benefit is ungrateful\nas soon as a benefit has been received\nit is dead\nit is in the past and it cannot\ninfluence future action think about it\nthe concept of debt irrespective of\nwhether it's monetary debt or emotional\ndebt really only has power to influence\npeople because of the possibility of\nfuture harm associated with non-payment\nthis can mean lowering your credit score\nor it can mean wanting to spend less\ntime with you in the vast majority of\ncases people discharge their debts not\nbecause they are grateful for the favor\nrendered but because they are averse to\nthe harm they could experience in the\nfuture if the debt were not repaid\nagain what really motivates people is\npower\nthe carrot and the stick however it's\nshall we say poor form to make these\ncontingencies too obvious so what we\ntend to do is mystify power behind a\nveneer of ideality like a sugar coating\non a bitter medicine this veneer makes\npower easier to swallow and allows\npeople to save face when responding to\nits influences\nby mystifying power we give ideals\nplausible deniability which allows Peak\npower to remain hidden in plain sight\nhere's an extreme example of this\nwhat force makes soldiers hold an\nindefensible position in Wartime\ndo you think it's love of country\nor a commitment to duty\nno\nit's because if a soldier deserts\nespecially during wartime he will be\ncourt-martialed and executed\nso if he's dead irrespective of whether\nhe holds the line or runs away but\nholding the line redown's honor to his\nname and family and can in some small\nmeasure reduce the likelihood that harm\nmight befall those he cares about as a\nconsequence of his sacrifice\nthen holding the line becomes a better\noption for him\nonly because of the calculus of harms\nand benefits in effect\nthis might anger some folks because the\nideals of patriotism and Duty like all\ncherished ideals make life more livable\nby bringing us into further remove from\nthe Relentless and unfeeling application\nof power\nbut if this weren't the case if soldiers\nwould hold the line simply out of\npatriotism or Duty\nthen such a severe punishment surely\nshouldn't be necessary\nhowever my hunch is that if we were to\nkeep the patriotism and dispense with\nthe court-martial\nwe would have a lot more desertion when\nall hell broke loose and on the other\nhand if we were to keep the court\nmartial and dispense with the patriotism\nthings would look largely as they do\ntoday albeit with much lower recruitment\nweight rates\nin any case my friends the game any game\ndoes not run on gratitude the vast\nmajority of people will not retain a\nrelationship on the grounds of past\nbenefit\nbut they might if they stand to benefit\nin the future\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience please let me know\nin the comments below and if you've\ngotten this far you might as well like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel you can also consider becoming a\nchannel member with perks like priority\nreview of comments or booking a paid\nconsultation as
