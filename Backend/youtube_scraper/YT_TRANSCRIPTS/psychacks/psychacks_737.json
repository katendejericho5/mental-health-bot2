    "transcript": "let's start with the content creators\nthe fact of the matter is that it is\nvery difficult for people not to act in\nline with let alone against their\nfinancial best interests as a\nconsequence it's fairly unreasonable to\nexpect that people will in fact do so\nif more extreme content leads to more\nclicks views and shares and if more\nclicks views and shares lead to more\nRevenue then creators are slowly being\ntrained to create more extreme content\nwhether they're aware of it or not"
