    "transcript": "making men angry at women is a business\nand it's a big business on social media\nplatforms like YouTube so this is\nsomething that I think is really\nimportant for folks to understand\nespecially for all the young men out\nthere where the principal demographic\nfor many of these YouTube channels over\nthe past decade I have subscribed to\nmany of these channels and I think many\nof them do many things well however\nalmost all of them fall into the Trap of\nselectively focusing on some of the most\nflagrant examples of the nonsense of\nwhich women are apparently capable much\nof their content is cherry-picked to be\nprovocative and inflammatory because\nextreme content is more likely to be\nclicked viewed and shared very frankly\nit drives growth this content can kind\nof feel like anonymously rubber necking\na car crash from the privacy of your own\nhome it satisfies darker impulses that\nwe all have which are not socially\nacceptable to admit so I'm here to\ncaution guys who watch these channels to\ntake everything that they hear with a\ngrain of salt"
