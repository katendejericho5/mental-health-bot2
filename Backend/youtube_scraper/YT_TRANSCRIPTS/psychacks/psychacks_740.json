    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is making\nmen angry at women is a business and\nit's a big business on social media\nplatforms like YouTube so this is\nsomething that I think is really\nimportant for folks to understand\nespecially for all the young men out\nthere who are the principal demographic\nfor many of these YouTube channels over\nthe past decade I've subscribed to many\nof these channels and I think many of\nthem do many things well however almost\nall of them to some degree or another\nfall into the Trap of selectively\nfocusing on some of the most flagrant\nexamples of the nonsense of which women\nare apparently capable much of their\ncontent is cherry-picked to be\nprovocative and inflammatory because\nextreme content is more likely to be\nclicked viewed and shared very frankly\nit drives growth this content can kind\nof feel like anonymously rubber necking\na car crash from privacy of your own\nhome it satisfies darker impulses that\nwe all have which are not socially\nacceptable to admit\nso I'm here to caution guys who watch\nthese channels to take everything that\nthey hear with a grain of salt there\nvery well may be truth in what these\ncreators are saying how and extreme\nexamples have the didactic usefulness of\nproviding Stark exemplars of phenomenon\nthat may be difficult to observe in\nother cases in which they assume less\nintense forms and are confounded by\nother variables however any truth that\nyou glean should ideally be tested out\nin The Crucible of your own personal\nexperience and that includes the content\non this channel as well\nthink it out and see whether what I'm\nsaying may be true we have teeth in our\nmouth and not in our stomach because we\nneed to chew on things for a while\nbefore we swallow them whole\nSociety has become increasingly\npolarized in recent years and relations\nbetween men and women in particular\naren't mistrustful and strained\nhow did we end up here the answer is\nsomewhat complicated as it involves an\ninterdependent system with three main\ncomponents the content creators the\ncontent consumers and the social media\nalgorithms no one factor is really to\nblame so I'm not here to cast aspersions\nI just want to help people understand\nhow the thing works\nnow the shift toward polarization is\naccomplished in large part through\noperant conditioning which is what we\ncall using punishments and rewards to\ninfluence behavior the amazing thing\nabout operant conditioning is that it is\nusually done unconsciously in many cases\nneither party knows that he or she is\nrewarding or punishing or being rewarded\nor being punished and in most cases\ncontingency management is even more\neffective when it occurs outside of\nawareness\nlet's start with the content creators\nthe fact of the matter is that it is\nvery difficult for people not to act in\nline with let alone against their\nfinancial best interests as a\nconsequence it's fairly unreasonable to\nexpect that people will in fact do so\nif more extreme content leads to more\nclicks views and shares and if more\nclicks views and shares lead to more\nRevenue then creators are slowly being\ntrained to create more extreme content\nwhether they're aware of it or not take\nthis channel for instance I have a few\ndozen playlists on a whole variety of\ntopics inspired by my clinical practice\nI talk about spirituality and\nConsciousness grief and loss success and\nachievement emotional regulation and\nMastery among others and I can tell you\nthat if I just put the word woman in the\ntitle of an episode\nthat episode will get at least five\ntimes as many views as an episode that\ndoes not this is a powerful incentive to\ncreate more and more videos about women\nnow I'm probably not going to make the\nchannel exclusively about women because\nI would find that boring however many\ncreators end up in a situation where\ntheir channels are simply the same one\nvideo in hundreds of slightly different\npermutations\nthat said I'm aware of this constant\npull to do just that that I have to\nactively resist and it may be easier for\nme to do so because I don't need the\nrevenue\nthis channel is something fun that I do\nin the time when I'm not running my\nother businesses generating some revenue\nis nice it allows me to invest more in\nthe channel but it is nowhere close to\nreplacing the income generated by my\nprivate practice\nso I might be able to afford to be more\nintellectually honest and autonomous\nbecause I'm not dependent on the revenue\ngenerated by the channel or affiliate\nadvertisements\nand this isn't just because I'm fairly\nsmall if certain other creators some of\nwhom may have gotten very very big have\ngiven up their other revenue streams to\nfocus exclusively on their channels well\nthis puts them in a vulnerable position\nvis-a-vis their livelihood and again I'm\nnot blaming these creators because it is\nvery hard for anyone to act against\ntheir financial best interests and\neveryone needs to make a living and if\nthat means making money on social media\nall the power to them speaking of which\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this video to someone who might\nbenefit from its message it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the super thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value that you\nfeel you have derived from this video I\nreally appreciate your support\nall right next up is the algorithm right\nout of the gate we have to appreciate\nthat algorithms are not neutral in the\nfirst place they will exhibit biases\nbased on the data on which they have\nbeen trained and in many cases these\nbiases can only be observed across\nmillions or billions of data points so\nthey are functionally invisible to\nhumans until their operation produces\nsignificant Downstream consequences\nand in the second place they are\nbusiness tools that were ultimately\ncreated to drive Revenue to their parent\ncompanies for instance the primary goal\nof YouTube is to keep people on YouTube\nthat's it the more people watch the more\nopportunities to sell advertisements and\nthe more lucrative those ad spots become\nthis has to come before everything\nbecause if the business isn't solvent\nany other goals the company might have\ncan't be met\ntraditional media has understood this\nfor centuries the primary goal of\nnewspapers is not to tell the truth when\nthat happens it's a fortunate\nafterthought it's to sell more\nnewspapers and Sensational headlines are\nprint media's equivalent of clickbaity\ntitles\nturn on a news broadcast any of them\nmost of what you'll see is Sex and Death\nand decontextualized sound bites on\ncontroversial issues this material is\ndesigned to stimulate an emotional\nresponse so that bam they can hit you\nwith an advertising break every eight to\nten minutes\nyour emotions make you less rational and\ntherefore more likely to buy whatever it\nis they're selling if you're interested\nin learning more about this I would\nhighly encourage you to check out the\nexcellent film Network or read\ngerrymander's four Arguments for the\nelimination of television\nin any case if people are more likely to\nengage with Sensational provocative\ncontent then the algorithm will promote\nSensational provocative content this\nwill encourage people to click watch and\nshare which engagement translates\neventually to money in the bank so\nthat's the algorithm\nlast but not least are the content\nconsumers\nlet's be real\ncreators wouldn't be swayed by the\noperant contingencies and the algorithms\nwouldn't not be promoting sensationalist\ncontent\nif you didn't click on it\nbut just like the proverbial car crash\nthere seems to be something in human\npsychology that makes it very difficult\nnot to look\nsocial media has also not been around\nfor very long so we're all still kind of\nlearning how to navigate the technology\nwith discipline and moderation\nbut let me tell you if you ever complain\nabout the polarization of society\nthen do your part and don't click on\nExtreme Sensational content don't watch\nit and don't share it\nconsumers changing their consumption\nwill have significant Downstream\nconsequences for both the creators and\nthe algorithm\nas I said previously creators consumers\nand algorithms they're all kind of in it\ntogether no one component is really\nresponsible for social polarization but\neach contributes to it as a consequence\nof the feedback loops that constitute\ntheir interdependence\nand with respect to a lot of red pilled\nchannels you need to appreciate that men\nmaking men angry at women by means of\nSensational content is a business\nand if you buy it wholesale then you are\na customer\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you can\nalso consider becoming a channel member\nwith perks like priority review of\ncomments or booking a paid consultation\nas usual\nthank you for listening"
