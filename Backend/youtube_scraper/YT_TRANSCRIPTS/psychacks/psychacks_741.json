    "transcript": "many folks are lamenting the current\nstate of affairs between men and women\nespecially with respect to mating and\ndating and a common refrain that I hear\nechoed in the comments and in my\npersonal life is how did we end up in\nthis situation like it didn't used to be\nthis way right how did things get so bad\nit's an interesting question and I have\nan answer to this question that comes\nfrom a rather unlikely place the answer\nto this question can be found of all\nplaces in the movie Crouching Tiger\nHidden Dragon on the surface it's this\nreally fun martial arts movie however\nthe story also contains several profound\npsychological messages that I just\nwasn't equipped to appreciate when I\nfirst watched the movie over 20 years\nago the film script seems almost\nsuperficial and most the\ncharacterization is accomplished through\nsubtle suggestion and indirect reference\nhowever this is a clue that we're\nactually dealing with aspects of human\nexperience that transcend time and space"
