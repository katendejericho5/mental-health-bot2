    "transcript": "if you are functionally\nindistinguishable from your immediate\ncompetition then you lose the game of\nmating and dating men have to stand out\nthis means that you have to create a\ncontrast between yourself and your\nimmediate environment and competition in\norder to even be visually recognizable\nas an individual Man without this you\nare simply field not focused and the\nworld will pass you by so how does a man\ndo this how does he separate himself\nfrom his field what I'd like you to\nconsider is that the way men present\nthemselves especially with respect to\nhow they dress is like branding you want\nto create a brand to give a certain\nimpression to your potential customers\nwhich should motivate them to look more\ncarefully at what you have to offer\nbasically a woman should be able to look\nat you at your branding and Come Away\nwith a decent idea of what might be in\nstore for her on a date and just like\nbranding this can be accomplished\nthrough careful attention to your\nappearance"
