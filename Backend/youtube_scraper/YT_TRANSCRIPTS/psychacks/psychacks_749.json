    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is\npsychak's Better Living Through\npsychology and the topic of today's\nshort talk is most men are wallpaper\nwhat does this mean it means that most\nmen like wallpaper are functionally\ninvisible both to other men and more to\nthe point to women and this is\ninteresting because it's in stark\ncontrast to what we typically see in\nnature in nature it's the females who\nare drab and camouflaged and the males\nwho are spectacularly arrayed and this\nkind of makes sense if the females are\nprecious because they are the limiting\nfactor of reproduction for the species\nit makes sense that they should be as\ninconspicuous as possible there is\nsafety in inconspicuousness in a world\nfull of predation\non the other hand the male's\nconspicuousness also makes sense as it\nis used as a proxy for health and\nSuperior genetics in the females sexual\nselection the most obvious example of\nthis is that peacocks Cox\nare the fabulous males whereas P hens\nhens are cryptic by comparison however\nthe natural world is full of\nobservations that uh back up this\nparticular point\nhowever in modern humans there has been\nan incredible reversal in this\nphenomenon in intersectional Dynamics\njust look at the Oscars or any Gala\ncelebration the men all dress alike in\nthe same black and white tuxedo whereas\neach woman is an individual Extravaganza\na unique spectacle of color form and\nDesign\nin many respects the men just seem to\nexist as foils to highlight the woman's\nBeauty like a simple setting for a\ndazzling Jewel\nhow did this happen\nyou know I'm not really sure but I'm\nhere to tell you that continuing in this\nvein of inconspicuousness is very very\ndangerous for men\nlisten closely\nthe biggest risk a man can take in his\nlife is not taking a risk\nif a man does not take a risk the world\npasses him by and that will be the end\nof him if a man has not put himself out\nthere no one is going to come by to make\nsure he's okay\nno one is going to give him money no one\nis going to give him sex or love he will\nget nothing from no one gentlemen you\nhave to risk it for the biscuit\nand this is just not the case with women\nis this equal no is this Fair no is that\nthe way it is yeah\nwork with it and if possible make it\nwork for you take a risk and one way to\ndo that is to stand out from your\nimmediate environment I was having a\ntalk with Logan Yuri recently and she\ntold me that she often receives the same\ncomplaint from women she's advising in a\ndating context in the Bay Area namely\nthat all the men are the same\nwhich in the Bay Area apparently means\nthat they all work in Tech and do rock\nclimbing as a hobby\nnow in a different city or a different\npart of the world a man who worked in\nTech and did rock climbing as a hobby\nwould be an interesting anomaly in San\nFrancisco however it's apparently par\nfor the course so in San Francisco\nworking in Tech and doing rock climbing\nas a hobby\nis wallpaper wallpaper is not inherent\nit is contingent upon your immediate\nenvironment and your immediate\ncompetition if you are functionally\nindistinguishable from your immediate\nenvironment and your immediate\ncompetition then you lose the game of\nmating and dating men have to stand out\nthis means that you have to create a\ncontrast between yourself and your\nimmediate environment and competition in\norder to even be visually recognizable\nas an individual Man without this you\nare simply field not focused and the\nworld will pass you by\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nyou can also hit the super thanks button\nwhich is those three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner beneath the\nvideo and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you derive from this\nepisode I really do appreciate your\nsupport\nso how does a man do this how does he\nseparate himself from his field what I'd\nlike you to consider is that the way men\npresent themselves especially with\nrespect to how they dress is like\nbranding\nit helps to think of dating in a sense\nlike marketing you want to create a\nbrand to give a certain impression to\nyour potential customers which should\nmotivate them to look more carefully at\nwhat you have to offer you might have\nthe best product or service in the world\nhowever if you cannot capture attention\nthrough marketing you might not survive\nas a business and just like marketing\nit's all right for The Branding to let's\nsay be a selective or exaggerated\nversion of what you potentially have on\noffer it shouldn't be completely\ndisjointed from what's on the menu and\nas that will simply create problems\nfurther down the sales funnel but it\ncertainly doesn't have to be isomorphic\nwith the menu\nnow what does this mean in practice\nbasically a woman should be able to look\nat you at your branding and Come Away\nwith a decent idea of what might be in\nstore for her on a date and just like\nbranding amazingly enough this can be\naccomplished through careful attention\nto your appearance\nI'm going to walk you through what that\nmight look like using an example from an\nunlikely place so\nI've never played this game personally I\ndon't even remember how I learned about\nthis game but there is a text based\ndating simulator out there called dream\ndaddy\nin which you play the teenage daughter\nof a gay man who is trying to match her\nfather up with another dream daddy I've\nput a link to the image I'm going to\ndiscuss in the pinned comment below I'd\nlike you to click on it so you can\nfollow along it's one of the best ways I\nknow to explain to men this idea of\ndating as marketing this is going to be\nfun again I've never played this game so\nI have no idea if what I'm about to say\nis accurate to the world of the game but\nthat's not actually relevant to our\nintents and purposes here\ndid you click on the link\nokay you can see that there are seven\ndream daddies and they all have a very\nspecific look to them don't they from\njust a sliver of their appearances we\ncan make some plausible guesses as to\nwhat might be in store for us if we were\nto date that particular daddy let's\nbegin on the left and work our way to\nthe right now this first guy oh he's\nobviously bad boy daddy we'd probably\nmeet him at a dive bar play some pool\nand drive off on the back of his\nmotorcycle without wearing a helmet so\ndangerous next up is Vamp daddy he's a\nsensual romantic into Fine Wines\nclassical Beauty I'm imagining a\nSumptuous dinner stargazing and foreplay\nby the fire\nin the third spot is Professor daddy if\nyou're a sapiosexual he's your man he\nlikes to have intellectual conversations\nand he'll probably invite you to soires\non campus where you can match wits with\nthe Literati\ncoming in at number four is Country Club\ndaddy he's obviously Rich probably from\nold money he likes Polo and yachting and\nTennis he knows all the right people and\nvacations somewhere fabulous next up is\nFitness daddy you'll likely hit the gym\nwith him do a yoga class make some\nprotein smoothies and give each other\nmassages you know to loosen up the\nfascia\nnext up is creative daddy he's maybe a\nmusician or a designer or a photographer\nhe's too school for cool and he knows\nall the best live music venues and\nunderground bars\nfinally you have big bear daddy he's\njust down to have a good time maybe a\nbarbecue next to his backyard pool\nnothing pretentious crispy canned beers\nlow-key fun and good vibes\nokay so does this actually happen in the\ngame I have no clue but that's\nnot really the point the point is that\nwe can extrapolate a reasonable fantasy\nof what we have in store by associating\nfrom these appearances they all make a\nstatement none of them are wallpaper we\ncan even consider these seven to be male\ndating archetypes they communicate an\nemotionally compelling idea which means\nthey are marketable\nthey are there are definitely others\nthan these seven but this is a good\nplace to start\nnow man I want you to look at yourselves\nif we dropped you in an unfamiliar place\nand people could only see what you\nlooked like\ncould they get a plausible sense of who\nyou are and what you're about\nif not then your wallpaper\nspending just a little time and money on\ndifferentiating yourself is time and\nmoney well spent\nwomen are really sensitive to these\nkinds of things having a Vibe and a\ncoherent look to your appearance will\ndifferentiate you from your immediate\nenvironment and competition\nit's a risk to stand out but it might be\nmore of a risk not to\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar
