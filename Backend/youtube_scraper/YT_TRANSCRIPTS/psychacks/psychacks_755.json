    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is love has\nnothing to do with relationships\nso I've made a number of episodes on\nboth of these topics however I typically\nspeak on each one individually since to\nme their Mutual Independence is an\nobvious fact of reality but it turns out\nthat what might be obvious to me might\nnot be obvious to others\nand when I speak about relationships as\nthe medium in which value is transacted\nI get a lot of pushback from folks in\nthe comments and the most typical type\nof pushback I receive is something like\nwell what about love Orion does love\nhave no place in a relationship how\nmercenary I guess we've come to the\npoint that relationships are simply\ntransactional these days and that's why\nmodern relationships are doomed etc\netc well I'm going to respond to this\ncritique in today's episode by arguing\nas the title indicates that love has\nnothing to do with relationships\nabsolutely nothing\nlet me explain why this is the case\nagain a relationship is the medium in\nwhich value is transacted since this is\nthe case relationships have rules what\nis allowed and what is not allowed\nrelationships have definitions this is\nwhat it is and this is what it is not\nand relationships have compromises this\nis what I will get for what I will give\nup\nand this is because we need rules and\ndefinitions and compromises to in effect\ndo business with each other\nwhich is what we do when we transact\nvalue\nhowever love has absolutely nothing to\ndo with any of these things\nlove does not love where it is allowed\nthat's absurd it has an imminent\ncontempt for rules love does not\nrestrict itself to a certain\nrelationship format it ignores every\nlabel and definition that attempts to\nconstrain it and love does not expect\nanything in return\nso there is absolutely nothing to\ncompromise\nexpecting love to abide within rules and\ndefinitions and compromises is not only\nabsurd it cheapens love\nit's the emotional equivalent of taking\nan animal out of its natural habitat and\nshutting it up in a zoo\nand then we wonder why the animal seems\nso spiritless and depressed for all the\nbenefits of its new arrangement\nthe other day I re-watched angley's\nCrouching Tiger Hidden Dragon it is a\nfantastic film and for all of its\naction-packed martial arts sequences it\nactually contains a really profound\npsychological message so maybe I'll do\nan analysis of the film in a future\nepisode but with respect to our message\ntoday\nthe main narrative presents two parallel\nlove stories one of which is between\nJulianne played by Michelle yo and\nlimubai played by Chao young fat\nthese two characters did not get married\nthey did not cohabitate they did not\nhave children they did not have sex they\ndid not buy each other flowers or cook\neach other dinner or go on vacation\ntogether\nthey did not talk about their feelings\nor Define what they were or wonder where\nthings were going\nin fact it would be very difficult to\nargue that they were in a relationship\nat all because what did they actually do\nwith each other\nbut these two characters loved each\nother so much\nthat they were inextricably bound at the\nspiritual level\nno ceremony required\nlate in the movie limubai is poisoned\nand he tells shulian that he has only\none breath left\nin modesty she averts her eyes and asks\nthat he not wastes his breath on her and\ninstead use it to enter the Heavenly\nrealm as he had been trained that's love\nlove is wanting the good for the loved\none without any regard for the self\nbecause the more you love the less self\nthere is\nlove wants what is best for the loved\none even to the point of sacrificing the\nself\nand Lee mubai replies that he would\nrather walk the earth as a ghost by\nshulian's side then enter Heaven without\nher\nthat's love\nlove wants nothing but in humility if\npossible\nto remain in the presence of a loved one\neverything else that you can get\nfrom someone else is worthless junk by\ncomparison\nlove wants only to remain in the\npresence of the loved one\nbut is willing to sacrifice even that\nfor the good of the loved one\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what I'm hearing please\nshare this video to someone who might\nbenefit from its message it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow you can\nalso hit the super thanks button which\nis in those three little dots in the\nlower right hand corner beneath the\nvideo and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you derived from this\nepisode I really appreciate your support\nso this is why love has nothing to do\nwith relationships all the things that\npeople want in relationships children\ncommitment respect sex lifestyle\nexcitement security love doesn't give a\n about any of them\nlove doesn't care\nwhether it gives everything and receives\nnothing in return precisely because it\nis not transactional\nbut we would call such a relationship\nwhere one person gives everything and\nreceives nothing in return and abusive\nor exploitative relationship\nlove is given spontaneously as a gift at\nthe pleasure of the lover\nexpecting acknowledgment let alone\nreciprocity is just transaction\ndisguised as love\nand this is because love is actually a\nform of defeat\nlisten up love is exaltation by virtue\nof the humiliated self\nand that is why it is so very rare to\nsee in the world today\nand not even today at any time in human\nhistory and why the people who are out\nthere looking for love don't really\nunderstand what they're signing up for\nlove is the humiliated self-exalted\nin Casino Royale when Vesper asks Bond\nabout his armor he replies I have no\narmor left you've stripped it from me\nwhatever is left of me whatever I am is\nyours\nbond is naked and vulnerable and\npathetic\nhe's humiliated himself\nthat's love\nand that's also why when he learns a\nvesper's betrayal he puts the armor back\non more securely than ever and\nfunctionally says never again\nwhy because to quote Leonard Cohen I've\nseen your flag on the Marble Arch and\nlove is not a victory march it's a coal\nand it's a Broken Hallelujah\nthat's right that's right love is defeat\nand that's why it's strange for me to\nhear people saying they are looking for\nlove and expecting to find it in a\nrelationship\nthis is some high level personal Alchemy\nI've got for you\nlove is the passage into a higher form\nof life through the Gateway of the\nhumiliated self\nif you've never experienced love before\nyou're going to think that this is\n but this is the true fact\nand it's also true that this has nothing\nto do with relationships\nwe need to be real with ourselves if we\nwant things from others if we need\nthings from others\nthen we don't want love we want a\nrelationship we want to do business\nand I see nothing wrong with that except\nthe rampant hypocrisy\nthat wants to pretend that that is not\nwhat it's doing\nand that is because wanting a\nrelationship is the right thing to want\nif you want things from other people and\nthat is because a relationship is the\nmedium through which value is transacted\nso if you want to do business get\nyourself down to the marketplace and\nprepare to barter with what you have to\noffer and if you want a lot be prepared\nto bring a lot to the bargaining table\nand we can do this because let's be\nhonest everything that you can get from\nanother person in a relationship has a\ntransacted value and can be bought\nthat doesn't necessarily mean bought\nwith money but it can mean that you can\nbuy sex\nyou can buy companionship\nyou can buy emotional support and child\ncare and home-cooked meals you can even\nbuy children through adoption or\nsurrogacy\nyou can buy everything that can be\ntransacted in a human relationship\nhowever you can't buy love\nand that is because paradoxically Love\nis valueless valueless in the sense that\nit is free\nand valueless in the sense that it\ncannot be bought at any price\non the other hand if you want love\nyou don't need a relationship why\nlisten carefully\nif love is wanting the best for the\nloved one\nyou can only reasonably want a\nrelationship with the loved one if a\nrelationship with you is literally the\nbest possible thing for the loved one\nand let's be real it probably isn't\nit probably isn't\nwanting the best for the loved one\ntherefore generally means sacrificing\nboth the self and the possibility of a\nrelationship\nthat's why Rick Blaine in Casablanca is\nthe Romantic hero par excellence\nhe puts the woman he loves on a plane\nwith another man because he realizes\nit's better for her that way\nremember love is not a victory march at\nleast not in any way we're used to\nspeaking about victory\nbut in so doing Rick finally succeeds in\nhumiliating the self which had been\nmired for years in cynicism and despair\nand presumably attaining to something\nhigher at the very least we suspect a\nnew beginning is in store the beginning\nas Louis says of a beautiful friendship\nI appreciate that this can be hard to\nunderstand so feel free to listen to\nthis a few times if you need to but the\nfact of the matter is is that love has\nnothing to do with relationships because\non the one hand love is valueless and\ntherefore cannot be transacted and on\nthe other love must in any case\nsacrifice the possibility of a\nrelationship with a loved one since the\narrogance of assuming that a\nrelationship with the lover would be the\nbest possible thing for the loved one is\nantithetical to love as the humiliated\nself\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider
