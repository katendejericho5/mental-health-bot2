    "transcript": "one thing that I believe that\nevolutionary psychology gets wrong or at\nleast fails to sufficiently appreciate\nis that we don't have to have recourse\nto phenomena that no longer exist to\nexplain a lot of mating and dating\nBehavior most mating preferences are\nrooted in a very primitive idea of\nsurvival which well not entirely untrue\nin my opinion kinda misses the mark\nbecause there is something that still\nexists today that has existed throughout\nhuman history and that in many respects\ncontinues to impact survival in a much\nmore pervasive albeit indirect way and\nwhat is that thing in a word status\nstatus exists today much the same way\nthat it has existed in tribal Clans\nhundreds of thousands of years ago and\nstatus in my opinion explains much more\nabout mating and dating Behavior than do\nsaber-toothed tigers and Savannahs"
