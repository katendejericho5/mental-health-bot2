    "video_title": "The NARCISSISTIC DILEMMA",
    "transcript": "from a purely psychological perspective\nyour experience of reality is likely\nmuch more a reflection of your own mind\nthan a consequence of anything inherent\nin that reality and this is problematic\nbecause if all people see are facets of\ntheir own projected Consciousness then\nthe universe is really just one big Hall\nof Mirrors which is functionally the\nnarcissistic dilemma everything is a\nreflection of the self and if that\nreflection is a projected judgment that\nis functionally based on whether you\nwant or don't want something to happen\nthen the entire universe is reduced to\nan instrumental extension of your desire\nwhich is functionally hell when people\nare operating under this delusion they\nactually can't see anything other than\nthemselves"
