    "transcript": "well let's talk about that book real\nquick this is a good segue into it so\nwhat are some of those games what is the\nbook about well the book is called the\nvalue of others and it's understanding\nrelationships through the lens of\nBehavioral economics so one of the\nfundamental premises of the book is that\npeople enter into relationships with\ntheir perceived best options kind of\nhard to argue with that it's like if\nsomebody could get a better deal with a\nmore attractive option they would take\nit what if you always think there's\nalways going to be a better option well\nthen don't commit which is a big issue\nin today's society and so in that case\nthe perceived best option is out there\nin the sea of illusory infinite\npotential which I talk about in the book\nas well but if you accept that that\nsounds reasonable that people enter into\nrelationships with their perceived best\noption then that means that the at the\nheart of all relationships is the\nperception of value"
