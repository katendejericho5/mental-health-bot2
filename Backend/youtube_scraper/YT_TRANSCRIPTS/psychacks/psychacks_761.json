    "transcript": "who has more power in a relationship\npower can be a touchy subject for folks\nmany people would prefer it didn't exist\nat all which is just another way of\nwishing that power imbalances didn't\nexist in relationships however power is\na fact of life and that's not\nnecessarily a bad thing as without power\nnothing would ever get done now it would\nbe far too simplistic to argue that men\nhave more power in relationships or that\nwomen have more power in relationships\nbecause the fact of the matter is that\nit can go either way and that's because\nit really depends on the specific\nindividuals involved however I have\nthree easy rules of thumb that you can\nuse to determine who has more power in\nany given relationship first a working\ndefinition of power power is the ability\nto get other people to act in the\nservice of your goals"
