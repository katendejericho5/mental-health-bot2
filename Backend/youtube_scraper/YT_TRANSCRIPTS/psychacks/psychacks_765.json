    "transcript": "how often has it happened in your life\nthat your partner has said to you we\nneed to talk and when you sat down with\nthis other person he or she said I need\nyou to know that last week when we were\nhaving a discussion about my mother I\nnever felt so heard and respected in my\nlife you need to know that I'm very\nsatisfied with this relationship and I'm\nonly concerned that I just might not be\nable to love you any more than I\ncurrently do like that never happens\ndoes it why is that because when people\nsay we need to talk it's because\nsomebody has a problem and they believe\nthat talking is going to resolve that\nproblem and again this is going to sound\nreally weird coming from a therapist but\nthat is often not the case only a small\nsubset of problems can really be solved\nby talking about them and in many cases\ntalking about problems becomes a problem\nin and of itself"
