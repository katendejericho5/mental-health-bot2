    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is sync\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nthe topic of today's short talk is\ntalking is overrated\nhow ironic now this might sound strange\ncoming from a therapist but I'm here to\ntell you that in relationships talking\nis overrated\nbut Orion isn't communication the key to\ngood relationships yes it is however you\nhave to understand that while all\ntalking is communication not all\ncommunication is talking talking is good\nfor some things like planning Logistics\nand it is absolutely terrible for other\nthings the most common misapplication of\nthis principle is assuming that if\ncommunication is the key to good\nrelationships then you have to talk\nabout everything all the time and that\nis absolutely not true a fair share of\neffective communication is knowing what\nnot to talk about and understanding when\ntalking is useless\nat this point in my life I'm convinced\nthat I could have a peaceful loving\nrespectful relationship with a woman who\ncouldn't even speak English\nwhy because the point of a relationship\nis not to convey semantic information\nand everything essential to a\nrelationship can be communicated without\nwords I'm also a fantastic partner which\nas we'll see makes a big difference\nhowever this hasn't always been the case\nI've been in some relationships in the\npast where most of the relationship\nconsisted of talking about the\nrelationship what did you mean when you\nsaid that how are we doing where is this\ngoing and that is death\nwhy because the point of a relationship\nis to come together and experience each\nother in the world through that\nconnection\nand while you can do this through\ntalking it is almost always less\ninteresting and vital than doing\nwhich would you rather do\nhave sex or talk about having sex\nbe on holiday or talk about the trip you\ntook six months ago\ntalking is to doing as imagination is to\nreality the former is a pale imitation\nof the latter and all other things being\nequal the more time you spend talking\nthe less time you spend doing and that's\nwhere all the good stuff is\nhere's another reason why talking is\noverrated how often has it happened in\nyour life that your partner has said to\nyou\nwe need to talk\nand when you sat down with this other\nperson he or she said I need you to know\nthat last week when we were having a\ndiscussion about my mother\nI never felt so heard and respected and\nvalidated in my life you need to know\nthat I'm very satisfied with this\nrelationship and I'm extremely content\nwith the way things are going and I'm\nonly concerned that I just might not be\nable to love you any more than I\ncurrently do\nlike that never happens does it\nand why is that because when people say\nwe need to talk it's because somebody\nhas a problem\nand they believe that talking is going\nto resolve that problem and again this\nis going to sound really weird coming\nfrom a therapist but that is often not\nthe case only a small subset of problems\ncan really be solved by talking about\nthem and in many cases talking about\nproblems becomes a problem in and of\nitself\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this to someone who\nmight benefit from its message it's Word\nof Mouth referrals like this that really\nhelp the channel to grow and you can\nalso hit the super thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nyou've derived from this episode I\nreally appreciate your support\n act actually helps to reduce an\nundesired Behavior it's generally\nbecause the possibility of talking about\nthe behavior again is more aversive than\ngiving up the behavior itself\nthat is talking is a punishment\nMarcia Linehan the creator of\ndialectical behavior therapy understood\nthis to be true when a client violated\nhis or her treatment agreement Say by\nmissing a group session or arriving late\nshe would not allow the therapy to\nproceed until the behavior was\nexhaustively discussed\nthe client would be eager to talk about\nan argument she had with her boyfriend\nor a conflict he had at work and she\nwouldn't let them she would take time\nout of what the client wanted to do\nto talk about something he or she had\ndone and clients generally hated that so\nmuch that they changed their behavior it\nwas the punitive component of talking\nthat moved the needle not the problem\nsolving or understanding potentialities\nof talking that most people assume to be\nresponsible for the behavior change\nto the extent that we need to talk works\nit's because it's punitive and\npunishments reduce the frequency of\nbehavior\nbut should you really be punishing your\npartner it's generally not a very good\nidea for a number of reasons in the\nfirst place to the extent that it works\nit increases the power imbalance in a\nrelationship why for the simple reason\nthat punishments can really only issue\nfrom the more powerful to the less\npowerful\nso the more you employ punishment the\nmore powerful you become and the less\npowerful your partner becomes which\nisn't usually sustainable as it leads to\nresentment on both sides punishers are\nresentful because they increasingly feel\nparentified and critical and punishes\nare resentful because they increasingly\nfeel infantilized and criticized\nwhat a drag after all good relationships\nare about enjoying who your partner is\nnot about changing them into who you\nwant them to be\nnow\nwhen do people feel like they need to\ntalk\nwhen somebody was disrespectful or\nsomebody was lazy or somebody was\nirresponsible or somebody was\ninconsiderate or somebody was\nwithholding\nEtc\nunpopular opinion but talking will not\nfix any of those things\ntalking will not make a disrespectful\nperson respectful or a lazy person\nproductive or a irresponsible person\nresponsible and insisting on talking\nabout these issues is really a kind of\nintolerance for the partner you chose\nthe way to solve these problems is not\nby talking but by being respectful\nproductive responsible considerate and\ngenerous\nif you are a good partner and you choose\npeople who are also good partners there\nreally won't be much to talk about\nthis is why I believe that I could have\nan excellent relationship with someone\nwho doesn't speak my language I know how\nto be a good partner and I know how to\nrecognize people who know how to be good\npartners\nall the things that I'm looking for in a\nrelationship kindness loyalty tenderness\nsensuality patience generosity\npositivity prioritization connection\ndo not need words\nin fact they can all be communicated\nwordlessly in actions and in a general\nattitude toward life\nI have plenty of people to talk to if I\nfeel the urge to do so\nI don't need a woman to talk to I need a\nwoman for other things\nthe fact of the matter is is there is\nlittle need to talk about most problems\nbecause the vast majority of problems\nspontaneously remiss which is to say\nthey tend to take care of themselves\nyou don't have to talk about every\nlittle thing you don't have to process\nevery uncomfortable emotion that you\nexperience throughout your week these\nthings come and go\non the other hand talking about a\nproblem enshrines that in the memory of\nthe relationship\nsuch that something that could have been\na temporary issue becomes a permanent\nfact\nthe only issues that really need to be\ndiscussed are deal breakers and there\nare really these are really just two\nminute conversations if a problem is so\nbad that it would destroy the\nrelationship all by itself then give\npeople the option to choose between the\nproblem\nor the relationship and move on with\nyour life\nit's not easy but it really is that\nsimple\nand that's what I have to say for the\ntime being what do you think does this\nfit with your own experience let me know\nin the
