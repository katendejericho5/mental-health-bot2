    "transcript": "wanting sex from a woman who is not in\nthe mood is kind of like showing up at\nyour favorite restaurant a minute after\nthey close let's say they serve until 8\npm and you show up at 801. and when you\nwalk in the door they say something like\nso sorry but we're actually closed our\nkitchen is closed please come back\ntomorrow just like in a romantic\nrelationship if you were in this\nsituation in real life it would be\nabsolutely ludicrous and entitled to\ninsist that you be served it's only a\nminute after closing time but it is\ntechnically after closing time and\nexpecting that an exception is going to\nbe made for you is a little narcissistic\nand absurd that said it would be just as\nludicrous for the restaurant to expect\nthat you're not going to eat until\ntomorrow just because their kitchen is\nclosed what do you do in this real life\nsituation you say absolutely completely\nunderstand enjoy the rest of your night\nI'm gonna see what else is open at this\nhour and I'll come back another time"
