    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psych\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is mission\naccomplished so what is this all about\nwell I'm making this episode to Mark the\nthreeyear\nanniversary of my first published\nepisode on this channel like any other\nproject I had no idea whether this would\nsucceed so when I began this process I\nmade a commitment to myself to publish\ncontent regularly for 3 years regardless\nof the response I received before I\nwould even entertain the question as to\nwhether I would keep going and now here\nwe are three years later wow today I'd\nlike to take this opportunity to talk a\nlittle bit about my process and how I\nwas able to fulfill this commitment to\nmyself because I think it might be of\nvalue to people in the attainment of\ntheir own goals first of all I have to\nsay that this channel has exceeded my\nwildest\nexpectations I didn't set a goal for\nmyself in terms of views or subscribers\nor watch time but I do remember thinking\nthat if I could get a thousand\nsubscribers it would be quite an\naccomplishment I was already thrilled\nwhen a 100 people would watch a new\nepisode because if you think about it\n100 is actually a really strong turnout\nlike when was the last time you spoke in\nfront of of 100 people few people rarely\nif ever get to command the attention of\nan audience that size I remember back\nwhen I was an actor in New York I once\nperformed in a three-hour show for two\npeople when I was a professor I would\nteach classes of 20 25 students Max so\n100 is like a packed Auditorium it's\nlike standing room only and when I hit\n1,000 subscribers I remember feeling so\nproud of what I had accomplished it\nmeant that there were 1,000 people out\nthere somewhere who were at least\nwilling to give me a chance and let me\ntell you it is very very very very hard\nto get people to give you a chance like\nyou could reveal the secrets and\nMysteries of creation you could teach\npeople how to turn lead into gold you\ncould bring someone back from the dead\nbut if that video only has three views\ngood luck getting anyone to watch even\nthe first 10 seconds that's just the way\nit is and now here we are 3 years later\nlast month we crossed half a million\nsubscribers and the channel routinely\ngets millions of views every week it's\nwild it is not an overstatement to say\nthat the success of this channel has\nchanged my life and it's largely changed\nmy life for the better and of course\nnone of this would have been possible\nwithout all of you who are listening on\nthe other side of the screen you\nliterally made this happen and I'm very\nvery grateful very grateful I hope that\nyou've benefited from the content that\nI've put out there and that your lives\nhave also improved as a result I really\nhave some amazing fans but back to my\nprocess when I first started out I\ndecided to give this project enough time\nto succeed so that's the first takeaway\nhere almost everything takes more time\nand effort than you might expect and\npeople people don't often give\nthemselves sufficient opportunity to\nachieve their goals and what is that\nopportunity well my rule of thumb is\nthat it is due diligence times 1.5 what\ndoes this mean well in this case I spent\nan hour to researching YouTube before I\nstarted out and I discovered that it\ncould take two years for a channel to\nget any kind of traction on the platform\nso I decided to give myself three years\nto\nsucceed right that's the two years\nsuggested by my due diligence times 1.5\nor 50% more time than what my research\nsuggested I figured that if I still\ncouldn't make it work at 1.5x then I\nwould have given it a solid effort but I\nwould probably need to reevaluate my\ngoals in my experience I've seen too\nmany people quit too soon and I didn't\nwant to be one of them this is kind of\nlike accounting for penalty time in a\nsoccer game you have to expect that the\ngame will not end at regulation if you\nonly pay yourself for 90 minutes you\nmight not be able to make something\nhappen when it might matter the most the\nidea is to always extend yourself past\nthe Finish Line because the finish line\nthat you can see is generally not the\nreal Finish Line so that's the first\ntakeaway now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow I'm also proud to announce\nthat my book the value of of others is\nnow available for pre-sale on Amazon I'm\nalso writing original content for my\nfree newsletter every week so if you'd\nlike to sign up you can do so on my\nwebsite finally please fill out an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription all right let's get back to\nit now the second takeaway is to begin\nwhere you're at and to build sustainably\nif you watch my first episode be the\nperson you in love you can see that I\ndon't have a fancy camera or a\nmicrophone or a lighting system or even\na script and I certainly wasn't about to\nspend thousands and thousands of dollars\non these things before I even began the\nidea was to get started as soon as\npossible and to learn from my mistakes\nthrough successive iteration and those\nmistakes were numerous I experimented\nwith lots of different setups and\nstrategies and in the beginning I did\neverything myself this often took 15 to\n20 hours a week and I had to find that\ntime after finishing my other two jobs\nand this wasn't easy I was often tired I\nwas alone and I received almost no\npositive reinforcement whatsoever for my\nefforts for over a year and a half\ncertainly no money but also no praise or\nsupport or consideration if people left\na comment on an episode it was usually\nabout how bad the audio was it was hard\nto keep going but I did didn't give up\nbecause I made a commitment to myself\nand this is the third takeaway I treat\nmy word as even if it's just to myself\nor rather especially if it's just to\nmyself as if it is a legally bonded\ncontract if I say it out loud I'm going\nto do it this is a discipline that I\ncultivated in myself years ago and I\nsaid this commitment out loud so I\ntreated this commitment like it was a\ncontractual agreement with a third party\nsubject the penalties if I didn't\ndeliver and my deliverables weren't\nsuccess or fame or money none of those\nthings were within my locus of control\nmy deliverables were consistent content\nthat's it all I had to do to fulfill my\nword was to post regularly and in three\nyears I haven't missed a single date it\nwas my job to post the content and\nwhether it was ignored or celebrated or\npraised or reviled was technically\noutside my pay grade and therefore none\nof my legitimate concern and I executed\nthat commitment to myself by channeling\nmy inner Postman neither rain nor snow\nnor sleep nor hail shall keep the\npostmen from their appointed rounds\nbecause I had made it myself appointed\nduty to post content regularly the\nquestion as to whether I felt motivated\nor inspired or EX exhausted or\ndistracted or whatever was completely\nirrelevant the male needed to be\ndelivered and it's going to be delivered\nregardless of the weather which is why I\nnever even asked myself whether I wanted\nto keep going this was something I\ndecided I was only permitted to ask\nmyself after I had given myself\nsufficient opportunity to\nsucceed that said the period between 6\nand 18 months was tough nothing happened\nit is hard to keep talking to no one I\nremember going to my men's group and\nconfessing guys I I don't know what's\ngoing on I know that my content is good\nI know that it can help people I know\nthat there is an audience out there that\nneeds and wants to hear this I don't\nknow what the problem is and this is the\nnext takeaway I was able to get through\nthat period without any positive\nreinforcement because I really really\nbelieved in what I was doing not not in\na narcissistic I can do anything kind of\nway but in a I've looked at this very\nvery carefully and my best thinking\nindicates that it should work kind of a\nway I stuck with it because I believed\nin myself and I was the only one who\nbelieved in me for quite some time but\nthat doesn't matter if you really truly\nbelieve in yourself then it doesn't\nmatter if anyone else does and if you\ndon't believe in yourself then it\nwouldn't matter if everyone else did\nthis is why it is necessary to believe\nit to see it without that I might have\ngiven up a long time\nago but here we are\ntoday with this I'm proud to be able to\nsay that I consider my commitment to\nmyself\nfulfilled and this of course begs the\nquestion am I going to keep going and\nthe answer\nis yes I'm going to keep going\nI'm going to keep going as long as I can\nin fact I have some pretty high\naspirations for this channel there might\nbe some changes in the future as I\nexperiment with new ways of delivering\ncontent however I promise to continue to\ndo my best to give you my the very best\nproducts of my thinking including most\nnotably my book which I'm very excited\nto release to you in
