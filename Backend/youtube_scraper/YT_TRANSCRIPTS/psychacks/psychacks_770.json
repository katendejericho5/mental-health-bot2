    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nhave a fulfilling sexual relationship\nwell too long didn't read the way to\nhave a fulfilling sexual relationship is\nto partner with someone who has more or\nless the same libido as you do this is\nsomething that generally doesn't change\nyou can do all the therapy you want you\ncan have all the conversations you want\nbut if somebody wants sex significantly\nmore than the other partner\nthat is probably not going to work out\nin the long term one or both of those\npartners are going to be frustrated with\nwhatever negotiated compromise or tacit\nagreement they hit upon so the way to\nhave a fulfilling sexual relationship is\nto choose someone who is interested in\nhaving sex more or less the same amount\nyou are and who ideally has worked\nthrough whatever baggage he or she might\nhave around sex and physical intimacy\nbecause boy do people have baggage\naround those things\nnow contrary to popular belief it's not\nalways the fact that men have a higher\nlibido than women do it can absolutely\nbe the other way around however I would\nsay that in general men want sex more\noften than women do with men sex is a\ndrive with women sex is a mood a drive\nis a Relentless impetus to action a mood\nis something that kind of comes and goes\nall right so in general men want sex\nmore than women do so if there is a\nfrustration in asexual relationship it's\nusually because the man wants more sex\nthan the woman does not always but\ngenerally so\nhow do you navigate this\nguys if you want to have a fulfilling\nsexual relationship with a woman you\nhave to establish consequences early on\nin the relationship it is much harder to\ndo this further down the road due to the\npresence of established reinforcement\nprotocols and likely explicitly\nnegotiated commitments it's possible but\nit's much harder so much better to start\nearly and what exactly do you do\nwell wanting sex from a woman who is not\nin the mood is kind of like showing up\nat your favorite restaurant a minute\nafter they close\nlike let's say they serve until 8 pm and\nyou show up at 801.\nand when you walk in the door they say\nsomething like oh so sorry but we're\nactually closed our kitchen is closed so\nplease come back tomorrow\nnow just like in a romantic relationship\nif you were in this situation in real\nlife it would be absolutely ludicrous\nand entitled to insist that you be\nserved it's only a minute after closing\ntime but it is technically after closing\ntime whether it's an inch or a mile out\nof bounds is out of bounds and expecting\nthat an exception is going to be made\nfor you is a little narcissistic and\nabsurd that said\nit would be just as ludicrous and\nentitled for the restaurant to expect\nthat you're not going to eat until\ntomorrow just because their kitchen is\nclosed\nso what do you do in this real life\nsituation you say oh absolutely\ncompletely understand enjoy the rest of\nyour night I'm gonna see what else is\nopen at this hour and I'll come back\nanother time\nand you take your hunger where people\nare willing to serve you it's that\nsimple\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help the channel to grow you can\nalso hit the super thanks button and tip\nme in proportion to the value you feel\nthat you derived from this video I\nappreciate your support\nnow I get where women are coming from\nhaving sex when you're not in the mood\nis kind of like eating when you're not\nhungry food just doesn't seem very\nappetizing but turning down a man's\nadvances doesn't diminish his desire\njust like saying your kitchen is closed\ndoesn't make that customer's hunger\ndisappear\nall it does is communicate that he will\nneed to go elsewhere for satisfaction\nand well no one would bat an eyelash at\na diner eating dinner elsewhere the idea\nthat a man would not just sit there and\nbe hungry if her kitchen is closed tends\nto give some women pause\nwhy well let's go back to the restaurant\nmetaphor there is a difference between\nsome random dude who shows up at 801\nexpecting to be fed in a good regular\ncustomer who shows up at the same time\nthe one is not equivalent to the other\nin both cases the restaurant loses the\nprofit on one meal but in the latter\ncase it potentially jeopardizes the\nprofit on an indefinite number of future\nmeals\nnow let's be real that restaurant\nprobably is not going to go out of\nbusiness if that one regular customer\ntakes his money elsewhere\nbut in general it's not wise to alienate\nyour regular customers so if a woman is\nliking a man if she likes his attention\nif she likes his lifestyle if she likes\nhis affection\nand he is now considering taking his\nsexual appetite elsewhere not in a hurt\nor vindictive way but in the measured\nand rational way a hungry customer would\nlook for a place to eat at dinner time\nthen she has to consider the possibility\nthat he is going to take all those other\nthings with him\nand this will give many women pause and\nthey might start to think well\nit is a minute after closing time but\nit is only a minute after closing time\nmaybe we can make something work in fact\nmaybe I can get even more out of you\nlike a big tip by making it seem like\nhe's a special exception to my usual\nbusiness practices\nso in the early stages of relationship\nthis is the leverage that men have you\ncannot force a restaurant to serve you\nif they are closed for business that's\nthe way it is however you can absolutely\ntake your business elsewhere\nand if you exercise this option you\nshould do so in a completely\nnon-petulant way like hey totally\nrespect your decision that's fine but I\ngot to do something about this so I'm\ngonna head out enjoy the rest of your\nnight and we'll get together some other\ntime\njust like in the legal system precedents\nhave meaning and relationship and\nespecially early on in the courtship\nprocess one of the many things that the\ntwo of you are doing is tacitly\nnegotiating the price of sex\nguys there is nothing wrong with just\ncuddling up to your lady if she turns\ndown a bid for sex however don't be\nsurprised if you're having much less sex\nthan you would like to further into the\nrelationship this is because you've\nbasically communicated that the same\ndegree of attention affection lifestyle\nand commitment can be secured with less\nsex which makes sex a more valuable\nrelative commodity in that relationship\nand I say in that relationship because\nno matter what time of day it is there\nis generally a restaurant open somewhere\nand the price of food on the open market\nis a more accurate reflection of its\ntrue value than the menu prices at any\nparticular restaurant\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like
