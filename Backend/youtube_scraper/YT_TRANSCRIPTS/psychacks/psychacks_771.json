    "transcript": "you're you had a you seem to have a\nparticular\num bone to pick with male feminists and\nI I find that phenomenon to be\ninteresting because it does sound from\nthis conversation so far I mean correct\nme if I'm wrong that it doesn't seem\nlike feminism\n[Music]\nreally advances\nthe\nuh goals of men like it doesn't seem to\nmake them happy or it doesn't seem to to\nget them better dating or mating options\nwhy would a man become a feminist\nI think it's a great mating strategy\nbecause if you are that guy who can uh\nit's like a dishonest signal in in the\nanimal kingdom where you have honest\nsignals of strength like a peacock's\nTales an honest signal of virility\nbecause it takes resources to generate\nthat tail you can't fake it but there\nare dishonest signals and uh\ndishonest signals are lies essentially\nthey're they're the illusion of vigor\nand vitality without it really being\nthere and I think that for a male\nfeminist and you know I know some guys\nare going to hate me for this and I I\nhave to say right out of the gate I\ndon't care\num for um for a man to adopt a\na feminist mindset and we should\nprobably Define feminism at some point\nbecause we're talking about it as if we\nall under we're working with a common\ndefinition so let's define in a minute\nbut for a man to take on a feminist\nmindset that is essentially anti-male he\nis he's being sneaky he's saying look at\nme ladies I'm on your side that guy over\nthere the guy that's working on the the\ncrane over there and actually building\nthat building across the street he's not\non your side he's a brute he's he\nprobably voted for Trump you don't want\nanything to do with that guy I'm your\nguy I'm writing these papers about how\nwe all need to to take better care of\nyou that's that's kind of a sneaky\ndishonest signal do you think these men\nare conscious that this might be a\nmating strategy\nI think some probably are to some degree\nand I will give many of them the benefit\nof the doubt they've been many men\nmarinade or you know they're marinating\nin this ideology from day one and maybe\nthey just can't see past it you know\nbecause they're getting it from from\nkindergarten all the way through college\nif they go to college or getting in\ntheir entertainment they're getting in\nfrom Marvel Comics you know they're\ngetting all the female empowerment stuff\nwhich is fine this is not about being\nanti-female\nso maybe they just can't see past that\nthey've been told for for decades that\nyou're a good guy if you think this way\nyou're a bad guy if you think that way\nthat's really interesting what's coming\nto mind is this\nclassic season of Survivor the TV show\nI'm not a big fan of Survivor but I\nthink it's a fascinating game because\nit's almost impossible to win\num and in this classic season it was men\nversus women\nand the way it generally works in the\nbeginning is that there's all sorts of\nlike physical challenges\nand based on which side wins the other\nside gets weakened and I think through\nthe first maybe month of the season\nit was absolute Massacre I don't think\nthe women had won a single challenge\nversus the men and they were dwindling\nand yet the winners of that season were\nall women like the top three finishers\nwere women and I was like why is that\nhow did this happen because\nthe women could not out compete the men\nat a single event\nthe way it happened is that the women\ndrove a wedge between the men\nthe women\nbegan\nuh\nthey went to some of the lower status\nthe lower performing men in the other\ncamp and said look\nyou guys are going to beat us but as\nsoon as we're gone who do you think is\nnext\nyou think you're going to beat these\nAlphas\nso you might think you're winning right\nnow and you feel really good but there's\nno way that you're going to be\nMr Chad over there\nand so basically the women succeeded in\nnegotiating a block with the lower\nstatus men\nat a strategic juncture of the season\nand those that block succeeded in voting\nout the highest status Alpha men who\nwere the most threatening to both the\nwomen and the lower status men and then\nas soon as they were gone\nall of the lower status men were the\nnext ones to follow because the women\njust voted them out\nso that's fascinating isn't that isn't\nthat incredible I mean and the the\ndifferences between the two camps were\nso striking the men's Camp was running\nlike clockwork they had fire they had\nshelter they were well fed the women\nwere shivering and wet and hungry\nthey didn't have the Survivor Survivor\nskills to like\nthey were barely hanging on at some\npoint it would they they resorted to a\ndesperate strategy but it worked and I\nthink one of the\nuh so they they used fear to motivate\nthe lower status men against the higher\nstatus men but I think they also used\nthe prospect of\nI think they seduced them a little bit\ntoo\nso what the women lacked in physical\ncapability to mastering the environment\nthe men lacked in psychological ability\nto recognize when they were being\nplotted on and manipulated yeah those\nthose lower status men were definitely I\nmean it was very fascinating because one\nof the strategies was to to play the the\nDamsel in Distress and the women would\ncome over to the men's camp and say oh\nyou know we're so cold we're so you guys\nare so strong and you know all about\nfire like couldn't you help us couldn't\nyou just spare the fire it costs you\nnothing you know it's like really kind\nof yeah and they're they're their\ncompetitors in this season of survivors\nmen versus women so can you imagine a\nrival pulling that card in like a\nsporting match or something like that in\na boxing match\nridiculous but yes uh women are\ngenerally much more Adept at let's say\nemotional and psychological warfare than\nmen I made an episode about this that if\nwe had a no holds bar No Holds Barred\nbar brawl between a man and a woman it\nwould be no contest I mean the vast\nmajority of men would just mop the floor\nwith a woman which is why we don't do\nthat it just seems like it's too unfair\nof a fight\nand to be fair that's generally not how\nfighting occurs in most relationships\nand the vast majority of relationships\nis not a physical fight it's an\nemotional or a verbal argument and the\nvast majority of men are completely\noutmatched completely outclassed by\nwomen\nthey don't they don't know how to argue\nlike women do they don't know how to use\nwords to hurt in the same way that that\nwomen do and that leaves them in a\nsignificant disadvantage so I think that\nit's really important for men to kind of\nI mean there's this there's this trend\nin society like not be a harmless man\nlike to you need to have strength you\nneed to have skills in a competent\nstrong man is\nit's not a heart it's not a harmless man\nhe could cause harm he could also he\nalso has the power to do good\nit's really the same power you know what\nI'm saying you have to have power one\nway or the other and I think it behooves\na lot of men to learn some of the tricks\nof the trade when it comes to women so\nthat they kind of know how to\nhold themselves in a fight\njust like it I think it makes sense for\nguys to to know how to like take a punch\nor throw a punch it makes sense for guys\nto know how to\nhow to recognize emotional manipulation\nand how to\npotentially\ntolerate and resolve their own\ndiscomfort that comes up in the presence\nof a woman's distress\nyeah you said so much good stuff there"
