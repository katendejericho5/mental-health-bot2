    "transcript": "at least when it comes to their sexual\nrelationships the vast majority of women\nwould not have a problem with an unequal\nsplit provided that it favors her I\ndon't know any woman who would continue\nto work for the next 40 years on Purely\nideological grounds if her husband were\nwilling to completely bankroll her\nlifestyle and I don't see anything wrong\nwith that they might not all Express\ngratitude but they probably wouldn't\nbulk at the arrangement nor would most\nwomen have a problem with a 90-10 split\nor an 80 20 split or a 70 30 split which\nI personally think is the best\narrangement or even a 60 40 split\nhowever we're really getting to a\nwoman's limit when we hit that 50 50\nsplit and we know that because there are\nvery few women who would feel good about\neven a 40-60 split if they're the ones\nassuming the majority of the expenses\nand responsibilities for the majority of\nwomen 50 50 is the furthest they're\nwilling to go"
