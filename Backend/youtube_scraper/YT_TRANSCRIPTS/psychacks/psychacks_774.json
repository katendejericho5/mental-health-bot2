    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why 50 50\nrelationships don't work\nokay so this is a very common belief\nthat is prevalent in Western Society\nnamely that relationships between men\nand women should be 50 50. it's equal\npeople get as much as they give and it\ncreates the basis for a fulfilling and\nsustainable long-term relationship right\nwell not really well this might sound\ngood it doesn't really work in practice\nfor a whole host of reasons over the\nnext eight minutes I will explain one of\nthese reasons to you here we go\nat least when it comes to their sexual\nrelationships assuming they are in a\nrelationship with a man they are\nattracted to the vast majority of women\nwould not have a problem with an unequal\nsplit provided that it favors her\nI don't know any woman who would\ncontinue to work for the next 40 years\non Purely ideological grounds if her\nhusband were willing to completely\nbankroll her lifestyle and I don't see\nanything wrong with that\nthey might not all Express gratitude but\nthey probably wouldn't bulk at the\narrangement\nnow\nnor would most women have a problem with\na 90-10 split or an 80 20 split or a 70\n30 split which I personally think is the\nbest arrangement or even a 60 40 split\nhowever we're really getting to a\nwoman's limit when we hit that 50 50\nsplit and we know that because there are\nvery few women who would feel good about\neven a 40-60 split if they're the ones\nassuming the majority of the expenses\nand responsibilities do you see\nwhat that means is that for the majority\nof women 50 50 is the furthest they're\nwilling to go\n50 50 is a stretch\nthey're not signing up for relationships\nwhere they assume the majority of the\nexpense and responsibility 50 50 is\ntheir limit\nnow let's put that aside for the moment\nand approach the idea of equality from\nthe perspective of men\nif I were to ask 100 men what it would\nlook like to fairly distribute expenses\nand responsibilities between two people\nI guarantee that 100 out of those 100\nmen would answer\nyou split them 50 50. and that's because\n50 50 is the definition of\nequality do you see however in reality\nmen have largely resigned themselves to\nassuming a greater share of the expenses\nand responsibilities in relationships\nwith women not because it's fair not\nbecause it's equal but because that's\njust sort of the cost of doing business\nas Eddie Murphy said there is no romance\nwithout Finance\none way or the other you gotta pay to\nplay\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message\nbecause it's Word of Mouth referrals\nlike this that really help to make the\nchannel grow\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you derive from this episode I\nreally appreciate your support\nso now we're well positioned to\nunderstand why 50 50 relationships\nbetween men and women don't work in\npractice it's very simple\n50 50 is where Men start\non the other hand 50 50 is where women\nend up\nlike there are women who are willing to\ndo 50 50 but they are outnumbered by the\nnumber of women who would be happy with\nan 80 20 split\nand there are men willing to do 80 20\nbut they are outnumbered by The Men Who\nwould be happy with a 50 50 split\nin a 50 50 split the woman is giving the\nmost she is willing to give with respect\nto the relationship while the man is\ngiving the least he is practically\nwilling to give with respect to the\nrelationship\nif a car were being sold this would be\nequivalent to a negotiated price that is\nthe most the buyer is willing to spend\nand the least the seller is willing to\ndiscount\nirrespective of the actual value of that\ncar do you think both the buyer and the\nseller are going to be equally happy\nabout that transaction\nabsolutely not the buyer is going to be\ngrumbling and the seller is going to\nfeel peachy keen and that's just one\ntransaction imagine living that\ntransaction day in and day out week\nafter week month after month year after\nyear that's unsustainable\nand it's not sustainable due to the\nobjective equality or inequality of the\ntransaction whatever that might be\nit's not sustainable due to the feelings\nassociated with the relative allocation\nof resources it may be fair but it\ndoesn't feel Fair\nand this is partly due to Market forces\na woman could likely find a man who\nwould be willing to assume more than\nequal share of the expenses and\nresponsibilities so she can plausibly\nfeel like she's getting a bad deal at a\n50 50 split\npeople feel pretty schmucky when they\nbuy something a week before a sale\neven though they were apparently happy\nenough to part with more money for the\nsame product the week previous which\nmeans that they felt it was a fair\ntransaction at that price point they\ndon't like the fact that they could have\npaid less for the same thing our\nconception of value is not really\nanchored at the objective or inherent\nvalue of a thing whatever that is it's\nalmost entirely determined by the price\npoints of similar transactions\nnow I'm explaining this not because I\nbelieve that things should be different\nI'm explaining this because that's the\nway it is I know it can be hard for men\nto understand this but For Better or For\nWorse\n50 50 is a stretch for most women\nand very few women consider going Beyond\n50 50 as a realistic possibility\non the other hand the vast majority of\nmen understand the Practical necessity\nof going Beyond 50 50. this creates the\nemotional conditions that amount to a\nwoman feeling like she's spending more\nthat she has to\nfor at an equal allocation of expenses\nand responsibility\nequal doesn't feel Fair which is why it\ndoesn't tend to work\nand personally I'm not into 50 50\nrelationships I'll just put it out there\nI work best in relationships where there\nis a clear power imbalance\nand part of the cost of a power\nimbalance that favors me is that I\nassume greater responsibility for the\nmaterial aspects of that relationship\nit's not equal but it's fair\nand an unequal relationship that feels\nFair will be much more sustainable than\nan equal relationship that feels unfair\nthat's just the way it is\nand as long as the Privileges are\ncommensurate with the responsibilities\nthen the relationship will continue to\nfeel fair to the individuals involved\nirrespective of the actual allocation of\nexpenses and responsibilities does that\nmake sense\ngood\nwhat do you think\ndoes this fit with your own
