    "transcript": "how to see God if you don't believe this\nis something of an ambitious topic I\nwant to begin by saying that there are\nmany different paths to seeing God and\nthat this might be one of them now this\ntalk is explicitly directed towards\nthose folks who are agnostic or\natheistic my understanding of these\nfolks is that they look around and they\ndon't see any proof that God exists and\nconsequently they find it very difficult\nto believe in something that they can't\nsee or experience themselves and it's\nlike fair enough without an experiential\nrelationship or without any empirical\nevidence God really does seem like a\nfairy tale like it's a make-believe idea\nthat I don't know Comforts deluded\npeople who may not have the strength to\nconfront reality on their own terms\npossibly but today I'm going to help\nthese folks approach the idea of God"
