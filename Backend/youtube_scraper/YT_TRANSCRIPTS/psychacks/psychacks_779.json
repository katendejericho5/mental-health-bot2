    "transcript": "if men don't have plans what the women\ndo what typically happens is that the\nman increasingly feels trapped in a\nrelationship he didn't explicitly\nnegotiate because he just sort of went\nalong with the woman's intentions the\nway that this tends to happen is through\na phenomenon that I call relationship\ncreep if a woman has long-term\nrelationship plans and it becomes clear\nthat the man doesn't the woman will\nbegin to move the relationship in subtle\nways in the direction of her goal it\ncould look like scheduling a dinner with\nher parents or planning a romantic\nvacation for the two of you and none of\nthese is necessarily a bad thing but if\nyou don't actually want a long-term\nrelationship with that woman you should\nprevent her from steering the ship in\nthat direction failing to do so means\nthat you will slide into a long-term\ncommitment and this is very different\nfrom entering into such a commitment\nwith purpose and intention which is what\nI would recommend"
