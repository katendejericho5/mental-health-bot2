    "transcript": "what makes relationships so challenging\nis not that they are transactional in\nfact if we were collectively more\naccepting and explicit about this\nreality we would all probably have an\neasier time with things what makes\nrelationships so challenging is that the\ngoods being transacted are typically not\nexplicitly negotiated and acknowledged\nand are subject to all kinds of change\nand fluctuation over time my\nrelationship with my power company is\neasy because we're both consciously\nexchanging one thing for one thing and\nthat holds true over time now imagine\nyou're exchanging many things of\nfluctuating value outside of both\nparties conscious awareness the fact\nthat some people find a way to do this\nindefinitely is nothing short of\nmiraculous however one of their secrets\nmight be in how these people count how\npeople calculate how much they give and\nhow much they get is subject to all\nkinds of squirl this is because in\ngeneral people overvalue what they give\nand undervalue what they get"
