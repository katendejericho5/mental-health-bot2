    "transcript": "for some women it can feel as though\nstraight men's interest in sex is some\nkind of annoying distraction or a\ndegrading objectification the real issue\nwith this line of thinking is a lack of\nappreciation for the real essence of\nsexual relationships as you know sex is\nextremely important to men and sexual\nrelationships are the one socially\nacceptable place where men can get it so\nit's actually entirely appropriate that\nmen bring explicit enthusiastic interest\nin sex to their sexual relationships\nbecause where else are they supposed to\nbring that interest you have to\nunderstand that sexual relationships\nhave kind of a monopoly on sex and if\npeople can't get something they want at\nthe Monopoly they typically don't\nsurrender the necessity or the desire\nthey go find it on the black market"
