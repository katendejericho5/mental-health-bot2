    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\ndo you only want sex\nso this is a question that men often\nhear earlier in the courtship process it\nusually occurs after the two have\ninitiated a sexual relationship and the\nman expresses interest and enthusiasm in\nhaving sex with a woman again and let's\nbe clear this isn't really an honest\nquestion it generally has a shaming tone\nto it as if wanting sex is somehow\nsuperficial or disgusting or insulting\nto the woman in question\nit also implies that it's somehow\ninappropriate to be focused on sex which\nis not at all sex positive and we at\npsych hacks are sex positive that said\nfor some women it can feel as though\nstraight men's interest in sex is some\nkind of annoying distraction or a\ndegrading objectification\nnow to be fair this attitude can be a\nreaction to let us say men's\nheavy-handedness with respect to their\nintention and I think I understand the\nwoman's experience here and feel free to\ncorrect me if I'm wrong in the comments\nbelow but the experience is something\nlike as a woman\nI want to feel like there's more to me\nthan just the warm hole I can provide\nwhich literally every woman can offer if\na man only wants sex well he can get sex\nfrom any woman and I don't want to be\nany woman so participating\nenthusiastically in an activity that is\nthis impersonal and generalizable would\nsomehow diminish me as a person I want\nto be seen and related to as something\nmore than a sexual object therefore\nconsciously or not I will punish men's\nenthusiastic sexual interest in me so\nthat I can have the benefits I hope to\naccrue from the relationship either\nincreasingly on my terms or more cheaply\nnow\nto the extent that I got that right\nthere's nothing bad or wrong with that\nsentiment inherently however there are a\nfew ideas there that are a bit misguided\nand my goal here is to help women\nunderstand this so that they can have\nmore satisfying relationships with the\nmen of their choosing\nleaving aside the belief that men can\nget sex from any woman they can't and\nthe belief that sex is somehow\nimpersonal it's not the real issue with\nthis line of thinking is a lack of\nappreciation for the real essence of\nsexual relationships\nas you know sex is extremely important\nto men and sexual relationships are the\none socially acceptable place where men\ncan get it\nso it's actually entirely appropriate\nthat men bring explicit enthusiastic\ninterest in sex\nto their sexual relationships\nbecause where else are they supposed to\nbring that interest\nyou have to understand that sexual\nrelationships have kind of a monopoly on\nsex and if people can't get something\nthey want at the Monopoly they typically\ndon't surrender the necessity or the\ndesire they go find it on the black\nmarket which is the shadow of the\nMonopoly\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to grow the channel\nand you can also hit the super thanks\nbutton and tip me in proportion to the\nvalue you feel you derived from this\nepisode I appreciate your support\nnow to be completely real with you\nladies almost all the things that a\nwoman can potentially provide a man\nhe can get elsewhere except for sex and\nmotherhood\nbut we're going to focus on sex for\ntoday sex is the thing that is unique to\nthe sexual relationship and so it kind\nof makes sense that sex is going to be\nof high priority with respect to that\nrelationship\nwomen complaining that the men they're\nseeing might only be interested in sex\nis sort of like the chef at Tony Roma's\ncomplaining that the people there only\nseem to order ribs\nthe chef might be like well I I make\nsalads too I put a lot of love and care\ninto my salads why doesn't anyone order\nmy salads because it's Tony [ __ ]\nRoma's it's the place for ribs\nwell why can't it be the place for ribs\nand salads\nwell because that's terrible branding\nand if Tony Roma's had the poor judgment\nto actually pursue that marketing\nstrategy it would not work out well for\nthem people go to Tony Roma's because\nthey want ribs that's what the place is\nknown for and that's where they know\nthey can get them they can get salads\nanywhere and in this metaphor a salad is\nanything that I can get from a sexual\nrelationship that I could also get\nelsewhere say from my friends or family\nor colleagues or myself\nmen go to their sexual relationships for\nsex for the same reason people go to\nTony Roma's for ribs what's on the menu\nis in the [ __ ] name\nand embracing this reality helps both\nwomen and Tony Roma's prosper\nso it doesn't quite make sense to me\nthat a woman might feel put off by a\nman's sexual interest in her especially\nif she's already in a sexual\nrelationship with him\ncan you imagine the waiter at Tony\nRoma's condescendingly asking so you\nonly want ribs\nit's not wise to shame your customers\nif those patrons weren't interested in\nribs they wouldn't have come through\nyour door\nand you can't get anything from a\ncustomer who won't walk through your\ndoor now can you\non the one hand advertising your\navailability as a sexual partner and\nupholding strict social mores about the\nsexual Monopoly of sexual relationships\nwell on the other hand shaming and\ndegrading men who appropriately bring\ntheir sexual interest where it is\nadvertised and socially approved\nis an enormous double bind\nit is unlikely to prove a successful\nmating strategy for women and it will\nlikely degrade the quality of the\nrelationship\nfor any man unfortunate enough to stay\nin one\nthis might be a bitter pill for some\nwomen to swallow but I gotta keep it\nreal for you\nif you want to be seen as more than just\na sexual object you need to provide more\nthan sexual value\nif you were to go out with me\nwhat would generally happen on the first\nfew dates well\nI kind of set everything up I take the\ninitiative and ask you out so I'm\ndisproportionately assuming the risk and\nthe responsibility for both of us I\nestablished the time the date the place\nand I'm going to pay for everything on\nthe date I'm funny making you laugh\nCharming making you feel engaged I'm\nintelligent making you think and I'm\ninterested making you feel special\nin this common dating scenario you just\nbasically have to show up\nand without sex what exactly am I\ngetting out of this interaction where do\nI get what I want\ndo you see so if you the woman want to\nbe seen as more than just a sexual\npartner then be smarter than me and\nteach me something I don't already know\nor be funnier than me and make me laugh\nor be more Charming than me and make me\nfeel something or be kinder than me and\noffer me emotional support or if that's\ntoo much to ask buy me a drink or take\nsome initiative so that I don't have to\nbe responsible for every last detail of\nthe interaction I already have plenty to\ndo and my time and resources are not\nLimitless unpopular opinion but it's\nyour responsibility to demonstrate that\nyou have more to offer than simply sex\nbut if you're not funny\nand you're not that smart\nand you're not treating me to anything\nand you're not taking initiative or\nresponsibility\nand you're not particularly kind or\nsupportive well\nwhat else is on the menu\nthat is a real honest question and you\nneed to think about that\nand you have to understand that the\nvalue proposition here is relative you\nmay think that you're funny and smart\nand sugar and spice and everything nice\nbut are you funny and smart and what\nhave you relative to me\nlet's be honest the higher the value of\nthe ma'am you happen to be dating the\nharder it will be for you to provide\npositive relative value for instance if\nI make significantly more than you it's\ngoing to be harder for you to foot the\nbill at the places I like to go\nif I'm very intelligent it's going to be\nincreasingly difficult for you to tell\nme something I don't already know\nand if you're not that Charming I will\nprobably have to do the entertaining for\nboth of us\nso what's the upshot that it's actually\neasier for women to be perceived as more\nthan just a sexual partner with lower\nstatus men\nbut those aren't the men they generally\nwant to sleep with\nso women are kind of on the horns of a\ndilemma either she has to really develop\nher skills and virtues relative to the\nmen she would prefer to mate and date\nor she has to kind of make peace with\nthe fact that when people go to Tony\nRoma's they want to eat ribs\npersonally I think it makes a lot of\nsense to play to your unique strengths\nin fact I could teach women to get\npretty much any man that they want\nbut one of the ways that women really\nshoot themselves in the collective foot\nis not accepting men's sexual interest\nand appetite\nladies you gotta think it about it in\nterms of marketing\nif you want ribs where do you think\nabout going\nand if a particular man wants sex which\nhe will\nwhere do you want him to think about\ngoing\nsomething to consider\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider
