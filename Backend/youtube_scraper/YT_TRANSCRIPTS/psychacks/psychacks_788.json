    "video_title": "The DIVIDE AND CONQUER strategy",
    "transcript": "divide and conquer in a social\npopulation is used as an instrument of\nsocial control I think I was first\nintroduced to this idea in high school\nwhen I read Howard zinn's people's\nHistory of the United States where he\ntalked about a lot of the racism in\nparticular in this country is not so\nmuch racism as it is disguised classism\nand he gave a lot of examples of how a\nlot of the pre-existing power structures\nthroughout American history have\nfomented racial hatred especially\nbetween poor whites and poor blacks and\nthe reason for that is if those poor\nfolks could see that they had more in\ncommon than not than their sheer numbers\nmight be a threat to the prevailing\npower base of that society and so they\nfomented racial hatred so that these two\nfolks who again might have more in\ncommon than not didn't join forces to\ndisrupt the pre-existing power structure"
