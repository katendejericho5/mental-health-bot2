    "transcript": "so there are ways of negotiating\nindirectly with subtlety intact and\nthat's what's more required in an\nintimate relationship what are some of\nthose ways well I talk a lot about that\nthe fundamental game of Human\nRelationships is negotiation and what's\nfascinating about this game is that no\ntwo games are the same even if they're\nplayed by the same players like if we\nwere to talk today our conversation\nwould be different than our talk\ntomorrow you know what I'm saying and on\nsome level we can't predict how this\nnegotiation is going to go ahead of time\nwe just have to respond on a momentto\nmoment basis to the new stimuli that are\ncoming out as a response to what you're\nattempting so you can't make like\nprescriptions and say this is how you\nnegotiate you can't follow a script you\ncan't just say use the strategy it\nalways works that's a lie certain things\nwill work more often than others on more\npeople but nothing will work on\neverybody all the time"
