    "transcript": "my working definition of the red pill is\na set of knowledge and know-how that\nfacilitates the construction of a world\nview that pertains to men's place in\nsociety and to intersexual Dynamics\nparticularly it's red pill in that this\nworldview deviates in significant ways\nfrom the dominant social narratives\nabout those topics I don't think that\nthe red pill is equivalent to male\nfeminism and I definitely don't see the\nred pill as anti-woman in fact I believe\nthat many of the understandings in that\nknowledge set can and do benefit women\nin that they can enable women to have\nmuch more satisfying relationships with\nthe men of their choosing you know that\nyou fully integrated the red pill when\nyou are no longer upset by the truths\nthat it reveals where there is anger\nthere is not yet understanding and the\nultimate goal of the red pill is\nunderstanding not an intellectual\nunderstanding that can rattle off a host\nof Statistics or esoteric terms or\nsex-based injustices but a deep\nemotional understanding that is\npredicated on an acceptance of reality"
