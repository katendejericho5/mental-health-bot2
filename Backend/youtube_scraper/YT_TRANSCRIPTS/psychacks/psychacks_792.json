    "video_title": "How the RED PILL allows FULFILLING RELATIONSHIPS",
    "transcript": "if you arrive at a higher level of\nawareness then the whole world changes\nbecause you yourself have changed\ndespite nothing being objectively\ndifferent what does this have to do with\nthe red pill just like your blue pill\nbeta simp days were probably\ncharacterized by relationships with\nwomen eventually your Red Hill Alpha\nKing days will probably be characterized\nby relationships with women everything\nis completely different and yet nothing\nhas changed and this is because\naccepting a very small minority of men\nwomen are going to be a part of our\nlives in one way or another and when\nfully integrated a red pill allows men\nto have fulfilling relationships with\nwomen in a way that makes sense for the\nparticular individuals involved women\nare not the enemy and they are not to be\nfeared or hated or shunned these\nemotional responses indicate a lack of\nacceptance and understanding that said\nmany men have been significantly harmed\nby women and working through their\ntrauma is an essential stage of their\nJourney"
