    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the truth\nabout the red pill\nso I think it's about time that I made\nthis episode I think it's an important\none and I hope that you will listen\nthrough to the very end\nfirst of all I think it will be helpful\nto Define what I mean by the red pill\nfor the purposes of this conversation\nbecause the term can mean a lot of\ndifferent things to a lot of different\nfolks my working definition of the red\npill is a set of knowledge and know-how\nthat facilitates the construction of a\nworld view that pertains to men's place\nin society and to intersexual Dynamics\nin particular\nit's red pill in that this worldview\ndeviates in significant ways from the\ndominant social narratives about those\ntopics\nI don't think that the red pill is\nequivalent to male feminism and I\ndefinitely don't see the red pill as\nanti-woman in fact I believe that many\nof the understandings in that knowledge\nset can and do substantially benefit\nwomen in that they can enable women to\nhave much more satisfying relationships\nwith the men of their choosing so that's\nmy working definition of the red pill\nand what I'd like to suggest is that\ntaking the red pill is something like a\nspiritual journey in as much as once the\nscales have dropped from your eyes and\nyou come to perceive and recognize and\nunderstand some of the truths about\nintersexual Dynamics and the way\nrelationships actually function\nyou're no longer the same person you\nonce were\njust like Saul was Blinded By the Light\non the road to Damascus and was so\ntransformed by the experience that he\neven changed his name so taking the red\npill can be an evolution on par with a\nspiritual transformation\nand within this framework I think it's\nimportant to keep in mind two spiritual\nteachings which can meaningfully inform\nmen's use of the red pill let's get\nright into it\nthe first teaching is kind of a joke\nabout Enlightenment and the joke goes\nlike this enlightenment\nbetter not start\nhaving started\nbetter finish\nlet's break this down because I think\nthat this joke contains a powerful truth\nthat is very applicable to the red pill\nso why might it be better for some\npeople to not start\nthe process towards Enlightenment I mean\nis there a better goal that we can\naspire to how could this be a bad thing\nagain the answer here has to do with the\nfact by the time you even make some\nmeaningful progress toward the goal of\nEnlightenment you are no longer the\nperson you were when you began your\njourney pursuing Enlightenment will\nrequire a complete transformation of\nyour personality psychology lifestyle\nand relationships in short to embark on\nthe process of Enlightenment is to lose\neverything\neverything you once knew anyway so\nthat's a very high cost and it might be\nbetter for some people to know that\nprice tag is very high before they get\ninto it and why is this because if you\nstart the process but don't finish it in\nmany respects you will be worse off than\nif you had never started to begin with\nbecause what happens when you make some\nprogress towards Enlightenment well\nlet's say that you become increasingly\ndissatisfied with the world\nyou begin to see through the heedless\npursuit of money and fame and status and\nsex and may even renounce them entirely\nhowever because you haven't yet arrived\nat full enlightenment\nand you don't yet have anything better\nto replace it with\nmaybe you've given up the bad but you\nhaven't yet fully replaced it with the\ngood\nwhat's more you've just given up a lot\nof the things that make life Pleasant\nand enjoyable without having yet arrived\nat real Joy or true understanding this\nmeans that with respect to Enlightenment\nit kind of gets worse before it gets\nbetter\nand if you're not committed to going all\nthe way to the end\nthen you might end up stopping at the\nhalfway point between who you used to be\nand who you might become which is kind\nof the least functional place to stop\nso that's why there's this admonition to\nbetter finish if you start\nand I think this really holds true for\nthe red pill because I think if you're\ngoing to take the red pill you have to\ncompletely swallow it\notherwise don't put it in your mouth\nif you swallow it halfway it's kind of\nlike it gets stuck in your throat\na lot of the guys I hear talking online\ntoday it sounds like the red pill is\nstuck in their throat\nit's an aggravating sputtering irritant\nthey're basically choking on the pill\nbecause they haven't yet fully swallowed\nit which in this metaphor means that\nthey haven't yet fully integrated the\nknowledge set into their worldview\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing then please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like that that\nreally help to make the channel grow and\nif you're interested in going to grad\nschool be sure to check out my top rated\ngr resale study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow how do you know if you fully\nintegrated the red pill it's very simple\nyou know that you fully integrated the\nred pill when you are no longer upset by\nthe truths that it reveals\nwhere there is anger there is not yet\nunderstanding\nand the ultimate goal of the red pill is\nunderstanding\nnot an intellectual understanding that\ncan rattle off a host of Statistics or\nesoteric terms or sex-based injustices\nbut a deep emotional understanding that\nis predicated on an acceptance of\nreality\nreality is what it is no more no less\ngetting angry at reality indicates a\nlack of acceptance about reality and it\nis our work to conform our understanding\nto reality not to work to conform\nreality to what our intellectual\nunderstanding believes it should be\nso if you're going to take the red pill\nmake sure it doesn't get stuck in your\nthroat because what's the alternative I\nmean you can't really spit it back up\nit's already been in your system and\nthat means you can't unsee what you've\nseen under its influence and choking on\nthe pills sucks men who do so are like\nthose who quit halfway into\nEnlightenment they completely renounce\nwomen and sometimes Society at large but\nthey don't really have anything better\nto replace it with yet\nnow this might very well be an\ninevitable stage in the process toward\ntrue understanding and integration but\nif so it is definitely a stage in that\nprocess it is not the end goal\nso if you're still angry after a while\nand you can't spit that pill back up\nyour only real choice is to keep\nswallowing until it's deep in your belly\nwhere you can finally digest it and\neventually integrate it into who you are\nand you'll know you've done this when\nyou're no longer angry and you begin to\nnavigate the world of relationships more\nsuccessfully than you used to\nand this leads us to the second\nspiritual teaching applicable to the red\npill maybe you've heard it before it's\nbefore enlightenment\nchop wood carry water after\nEnlightenment chop wood carry water\nwhat does that mean well among other\nthings I think it suggests the\nparadoxical truth that once you arrive\nat the point of Enlightenment everything\nis completely different\nand yet nothing may have changed\nit's a weird Paradox and difficult to\nput into words but it kind of makes\nsense if you think about it if you\narrive at a higher level of awareness\nthen the whole world changes because you\nyourself have changed\ndespite nothing being objectively\ndifferent\nso what does this have to do with the\nred pill well just like your blue pill\nbeta simp days were probably\ncharacterized by relationships with\nwomen\neventually your red pill Alpha King days\nwill probably be characterized by\nrelationships with women\neverything is completely different and\nyet nothing has changed and this is\nbecause accepting a very small minority\nof men women are going to be a part of\nour lives in one way or another and when\nfully integrated the red pill allows men\nto have fulfilling relationships with\nwomen in a way that makes sense for the\nparticular individuals involved women\nare not the enemy\nand they are not to be feared or hated\nor shunned these emotional responses\nindicate a lack of acceptance and\nunderstanding\nthat said I'm also not saying that men\nshould just get over it\nmany men have been significantly harmed\nby women and working through their\ntrauma is going to be an essential stage\nof their journey and I'm not saying that\nthe end result is supposed to look like\nmen and women holding hands and singing\nKumbaya for many men it is entirely\nappropriate not to return to the\nrelationships they once had\nwhat I am saying is women aren't going\nanywhere\nand the vast majority of men will\ncontinue to relate to women in some form\nor another after they swallow the red\npill\nunderstanding women and intersexual\nDynamics more generally is kind of like\nfinally reading the rule game the rule\nbook to a game you have little choice\nbut to play imagine all the fouls and\nthe injuries and the violations that can\naccrue by playing a game if you don't\nknow the rules\nhowever knowing the rules will not only\nkeep you safer but should realistically\ninform your strategies when playing the\ngame\nso I hope I haven't alienated my\naudience with this episode but you might\nas well know where I stand sooner as\nopposed to later I am not anti-woman\ndespite having many opportunities in my\npersonal story to become so\nI've worked to heal my trauma\nI've integrated my understanding into a\ncomprehensive worldview\nand I enjoy fulfilling effortless\nrelationships with women\nand I wish the same for all the other\nmen out there\na long episode but an important one what\ndo you think does this fit with your own\nexperience let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel\nyou may also consider becoming a channel\nmember with perks like priority
