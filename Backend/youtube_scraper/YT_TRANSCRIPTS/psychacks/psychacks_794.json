    "transcript": "it is woefully apparent that the things\nthat men and women are attracted to the\nthings that men and women tend to look\nfor and swipe for in their potential\nPartners have little to no relation\nwhatsoever to the things that we know\ntend to make for successful\nrelationships so how do men and women\ndiffer with respect to their superficial\ndesires well it will probably come as\nlittle surprise that men tend to be\ntragically superficial with respect to\nwomen's physical appearance and that's a\nreal kick in the teeth for some women\nnow on the other hand women not only\nhave their own superficial desires with\nrespect to men's physical appearance a\nman's height being at the top of the\nlist women also tend to be superficial\nwith respect to the things around men\nwhich means their lifestyle more\ngenerally and it's also true that people\nwant what they want even if it's\nunreasonable even if it's socially\nunacceptable even if it's downright\ntoxic fighting against this is a losing\nbattle"
