    "transcript": "many years ago I went out on a first\ndate with a woman in college and I\nthought the date went fairly well but\nthat night when I invited her back to my\ndorm room she turned me down and she\ntold me that she wasn't interested in\nnever seeing me again many years later I\nlearned that the reason why she didn't\ncome back with me that night the reason\nwhy she apparently wasn't interested in\nseeing me again was that her previous\nboyfriend had had his own apartment and\nshe felt like it would be a step\nbackwards for her to be dating a guy who\nlived in the college dorms unfortunately\neliminating a man especially a young man\nfrom consideration due to his\ncircumstances is not only superficial\nit's stupid why in my own personal case\nI lived in those dorms for like another\nsix months after which I got my own\napartment the lifestyle of a man is\ngoing to change but women often don't\nwant to wait they want to hang out at\nthe Winner's Circle which is actually a\nreally bad mating strategy for the vast\nmajority of women"
