    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nsuperficiality of Desire\nso I've been kicking around this episode\nin my head for a while and I've come to\nthe conclusion that humans seem to be\nmore or less hopelessly\ntragically superficial with respect to\nwhat they are attracted to and I think\nthis is true for both men and women the\ninternets would love to have a\nprotracted argument about which sex is\nmore superficial than the other however\nI think it's safe to say that both are\nextremely superficial albeit in\ndifferent ways and after discussing what\nI mean by this I'm going to offer a\npotentially radical and\ncounter-intuitive suggestion with\nrespect to how folks might choose to\nnavigate this reality so let's get to it\nall right it is woefully apparent that\nthe things that men and women are\nattracted to the things that men and\nwomen tend to look for and swipe for in\ntheir potential Partners have little to\nno relation whatsoever to the things\nthat we know tend to make people happy\nor the things we know tend to make for\nsuccessful relationships the height of a\nman\nthe size of her bust\nfor instance have zero absolutely\nnothing zero to do with whether that\nparticular man or that particular woman\nis capable of even a non-terrible\nrelationship and it's also true that\npointing this out\nisn't going to change a goddamn thing\npeople want what they want even if it's\nunreasonable even if it's socially\nunacceptable even if it's downright\ntoxic fighting against this is a losing\nbattle and one that I personally believe\ndoesn't need to be fought anyway because\nI've come to some measure of acceptance\nwith respect to this reality\nso how do men and women differ with\nrespect to their superficial desires\nwell it will probably come as little\nsurprise that men tend to be tragically\nsuperficial with respect to women's\nphysical appearance and that's a real\nkick in the teeth for some women because\nif a woman doesn't meet certain minimum\nstandards of attractiveness in a man's\neyes she's going to be functionally\ninvisible to that man as a potential\nmate now there are many many things that\nare within a woman's control that can\ninfluence her appearance Fitness and\nfashion foremost among them however none\nof them will make a woman gorgeous if\nthe genetics aren't there to back it up\nso I have some sympathy for women\nthere's only so much you can do and\nhitting the genetic Lottery with respect\nto looks actually tells us nothing about\nwhether she can say regulate her own\nemotions let alone hold a conversation\nbut men are going to keep wanting what\nthey want now before I go any further if\nyou're liking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to grow the channel and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then be sure to check out my top\nrated GRE self-study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow on the other hand women not only\nhave their own superficial desires with\nrespect to men's physical appearance a\nman's height again being at the top of\nthe list women also tend to be\nsuperficial with respect to the things\naround men\nwhich means their lifestyle more\ngenerally\nmany years ago I went out on a first\ndate with a woman in college and I\nthought the date went fairly well we\nactually ended up in a multi-year\nrelationship further down the road but\nthat night when I invited her back to my\ndorm room she turned me down and she\ntold me that she wasn't interested in\nnever seeing me again\nokay many years later I learned that the\nreason why she didn't come back with me\nthat night the reason why she apparently\nwasn't interested in seeing me again was\nthat her previous boyfriend had had his\nown apartment and she felt like it would\nbe a step backwards for her to be dating\na guy who lived in the college dorms as\nChris Rock has said men cannot go\nbackwards sexually and women cannot go\nbackwards in lifestyle here's an example\nof this in action\nunfortunately and this is where women\nreally shoot themselves in the\ncollective foot eliminating a man\nespecially a young man from\nconsideration due to his circumstances\nis not only superficial it's stupid\nwhy well in my own personal case I lived\nin those dorms for like another six\nmonths after which I got my own\napartment\nthe lifestyle of a man is going to\nchange and if the guy has any sense or\nambition at all it's probably only going\nto get better and better\nbut women often don't want to wait they\ndon't want to be a part of the process\nby which the man extrapolates the\ndesirable lifestyle\nthey want to hang out at the Winner's\nCircle which as I've mentioned in\nprevious episodes is actually a really\nbad mating strategy for the vast\nmajority of women ladies you can watch\nmy episode find your dark horse for a\ncounter-intuitive recommendation\non what you can Implement instead on the\nother hand a woman's face\nis kind of her face\nit's unlikely to improve over the course\nof her lifetime so while men might be\nsuperficial in basing mate preference so\nheavily on physical attractiveness\nthey're they're not quite as stupid\nnow maybe there's a reason women seem to\nbe impatient they don't have the same\nluxury of time as men do given their\nreproductive window so let's assume\nthere's some kind of evolutionary\nincentive for women's and patients with\nthe lifestyles of men however it's also\nlikely true that women tend to reject\nmore men for more superficial reasons\nthan men reject women for purely\neconomic reasons women just tend to have\nmore options than men do it's easier to\nkick someone out of bed for eating\ncrackers if you have some folks sitting\nup in the living room\nand the greater the perceived\noptionality the more superficial women's\nsuperficiality becomes and why not\nI'm convinced that most men would do the\nsame if they enjoyed the same degree of\noptionality I think this is an economic\nprinciple not necessarily a\ngender-specific one okay so why am I\ntalking about all this ideally I would\nlike people to at least consider the\npossibility that the gender-specific\nexamples of the superficiality of Desire\nthat they are personally frustrated at\nor enraged by\nare likely not going to change anytime\nsoon\namong other reasons they are likely\nrooted in evolutionary and economic\nprinciples that are royally indifferent\nto whatever social ideology happens to\nbe prevalent at the time\nthe superficiality of Desire is here to\nstay\nand within this understanding my\ncounter-intuitive recommendation is to\naccept this reality and learn to play\nthe game of superficiality more\nsuccessfully\nnow when people take offense at this\nrecommendation they generally do so from\nthe position akin to something like\nOrion the things you're talking about\nare Petty and insignificant\nwhy should it matter if I have my own\nplace what does that have to do with me\nwho I am as a person or a flat stomach\nor a nice haircut or that I wear high\nheels or not who cares those things\naren't me I fall in love with people's\nminds with people's souls and I want\nsomeone who wants me for me\nnot what I have or happen to look like\nokay and leaving aside the obvious lack\nof acceptance this response indicates my\nanswer to this is something like\nif what I'm talking about is really so\npetty and insignificant\nwhy not just do it\nI mean it might be Petty and\ninsignificant that your boss prefers\nbluing to Black Ink on his reports but\nif it's really no skin off your back and\nif it helps you keep your job\njust use the blue pens\nthe more superficial and insignificant\nthe objection becomes the less\ndefensible it becomes especially if the\ncosts associated with addressing it are\ndwarfed by the potential liabilities of\nnot addressing it\nthis means that women should not only\ntake care of their physical appearance\nthey should invest in it\nand potentially invest heavily and men\nshould not just take care of their\nLifestyles they should invest in them\nand potentially invest heavily\nif getting a personal trainer\nsignificantly increases your attraction\nthen do it\nif having a stylish outfit increases\nyour attraction then what is the problem\nmy people if you can spend a few\nthousand dollars to raise your\nattractiveness a point or two\nthat might very well be one of the best\npossible uses of your money\nI'm not sure if people can see your mind\nor your soul\nbut I'm absolutely sure that if they\ndon't like your Packaging\nthey're not going to stick around long\nenough to see it\nassuming they can at all\nfortunately addressing The Superficial\nelements of Attraction is actually far\neasier and far cheaper than addressing\nmany of the other things that factor\ninto the mating dating game so you might\nas well start there just keeping it a\nbuck\nwhat do
