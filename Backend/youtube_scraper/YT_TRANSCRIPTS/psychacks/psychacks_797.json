    "video_title": "The WRONG WAY men solve DISSONANCE",
    "transcript": "when a man becomes emotionally bonded\nwith a woman he begins to do things that\nhe wouldn't do with other women women\nwith whom he was only sleeping he begins\nto make commitments and sacrifices maybe\nhe moves her in maybe he proposes or\ngets married time energy money and\nopportunity are all sacrificed on the\naltar of that relationship and this is\nnot something he ordinarily does so his\nmind observing this behavior isn't a bit\nof a quandary this is the state of\ncognitive dissonance and it's not a very\npleasant place to be and the way that\nmost men unconsciously resolve the\ndissonance in this situation is\nbelieving some variant of I'm making\nthis inordinate commitment to this\nparticular woman because this woman is\nspecial it makes sense that I would\ntreat a special person specially and\nwhat makes her special is that she\ndoesn't do the kinds of things that\nother women do therefore I feel good\nabout the commitment and sacrifice I'm\nmaking it's warranted in this particular\ncase"
