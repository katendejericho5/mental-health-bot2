    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\nget jealous of their women's past\nso this is something that comes up\nfairly frequently in my sessions with\nfolks both in my private practice and in\nmy consultations and it's very troubling\nfor some guys it really eats them up\ninside they learn a few details of their\nwoman's sexual history they extrapolate\nmental fantasies based on those details\nand these fantasies more or less come to\ntorture these individuals and if they're\nnot careful they can act out of that\npain and punish their women for what\nthey did before they even met them\nobviously not a constructive behavior in\na relationship\nhowever it is a real thing it can really\nbother men and I'm here to explain why\nthis is the case this is important\nbecause where understanding is anger is\nnot\nto let go of the bitterness men must\nfirst understand what is happening\ninside of them so here we go first of\nall you have to understand that men\ndon't feel this way about all women's\nsexual history guys think about it if\nyou were just to hook up with a woman if\nyou had a brief fling or a Friends with\nBenefits situation I doubt that you\nwould be emotionally bothered by her\nsexual past if anything her sexual past\nwas kind of an asset to you because it\nallowed ease of access to a sexual\nrelationship with her if she had never\nhad a casual sexual relationship before\nit would have been more difficult for\nyou to engage her in one for the first\ntime so on some level her sexual history\nmade it easier for you to enjoy a sexual\nrelationship with her and I doubt that\nyou would be bothered by that so this\nphenomenon in men only occurs in certain\nrelationships and what relationships are\nthose\nit occurs when a man has become\nemotionally bonded with a particular\nwoman\nand why does this occur it can't be the\nmate guarding behavior that evolutionary\npsychologists like to talk about in this\ncase there's no one to guide her from\nlet's assume that she hasn't done\nanything unto ward in the relationship\nand that in fact she as as loyal as she\ncan be so why does the jealousy flare up\nabout her past\nthe answer is that when a man becomes\nemotionally bonded with a woman\nhe begins to do things that he wouldn't\ndo with other women women with whom he\nwas only sleeping\nhe begins to make commitments and\nsacrifices maybe he moves her in maybe\nhe proposes or gets married time energy\nmoney and opportunity are all sacrificed\non the altar of that relationship\nand this is not something he ordinarily\ndoes this is not usual Behavior so his\nmind observing this behavior isn't a bit\nof a quandary it's like\nthis isn't like you man what's going on\nwith you\nthis is the state of cognitive\ndissonance and it's not a very pleasant\nplace to be so people generally try to\nresolve that dissonance one way or\nanother usually unconsciously in order\nto avoid the negative emotionality of\nthat state and the way that most men\nunconsciously resolve the dissonance in\nthis situation is believing some variant\nof\nI'm making this huge investment in this\ninordinate commitment to this particular\nwoman things that I have never done\nbefore for any other woman\nbecause this woman is special\nshe's not like the other women\nshe's different\nand her difference is the legitimate\nbasis for my different Behavior yeah it\nmakes sense that I would treat a special\nperson specially\nand what makes her special among other\nthings is that she doesn't do the kinds\nof things that other women like the\nwomen I've casually slept with do\ntherefore I feel good about the\ncommitment and sacrifice I'm making it's\nwarranted in this particular case\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message

about it\nat a certain point you reach an age when\nsome of the women that you've just\ncasually slept with they get involved\nwith other guys they get married to\nthese men and start families and you're\nprobably not thinking wow what a lucky\nguy I wish I could change places with\nthat dude\nmore likely you think something like wow\nI can't believe a guy put a ring on that\nfinger\nno jealousy at all but here's the thing\nother guys\nthat your woman may have hooked up with\nin the past are probably thinking the\nsame thing about you\nthat's not a great feeling no guy wants\nto think that his special little lady\nwas some other guy's for the night\nguys the truth is and and this can be a\nbitter pill to swallow your woman isn't\nspecial\nshe's just special to you\nthat specialness may only exist in your\nown mind to other men she may just be a\nwilling warm body\nmen really get themselves in a pickle\nwhen they attempt to resolve their\ndissonance by believing that their women\nare different\nand that they would never do things that\nother women would do\na woman is a woman man and a woman will\ndo what a woman will do and expecting\nthat your particular sweetheart or wife\nor fiance is going to be the exception\nis probably not grounded in reality\nand the pain that results from coming\ninto contact with that truth is not her\nfault\nthat's something that you're potentially\ndoing to yourself through your beliefs\nand expectations and you need to find a\nway to get around that now if the scales\nfall from your eyes and you begin to see\nyour woman as Just Another Woman\nmaybe you won't marry her or make big\nuncharacteristic commitments or\nsacrifices and maybe that's for the best\nbut even if you do decide to take that\nstep you can do so with your eyes open\nand without Illusions you're not\nmarrying some chaste little princess\nshe's a woman like any other woman and\nthat means she comes with some kind of\nsexual history one way or another\nin my truth about romance series I made\nan episode on how romance is for men\nhere's another illustration of that fact\nRomance the idealization of love the\npedestalization of woman is a tool that\nmen use to justify to themselves the\ninordinate expense and commitment\nthey're making to one particular woman\nbecause without that veneer of\nspecialness if a man saw his woman like\nany other woman as just a woman it would\nbe very very hard for that man to make\nan extraordinary commitment to an\nordinary person\nromance is one way guys rationalize\ntheir behavior relative to a specific\nwoman and knowledge of their woman's\npast jeopardizes that rationalization\nwhich is what provokes the jealousy you\ngot it\nso what's the upshot it's basically this\nyour woman is not different\nthis may provoke some anger or\nresentment in some of you but you can\nwork through that you can work through\nthat and arrive at the point where you\ncan see her as just another human being\nno better no worse and only then can you\nreally decide whether there is enough\nleft to justify your commitment\nand until that time you're just\nbullshitting yourself\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if you've gotten this\nfar you might as well like this episode\nAnd subscribe to this channel you may\nalso consider becoming
