    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is produce\nmore than you consume this is a very\nwise General principle and there's a\nnumber of different ways that you can\napply it effectively and today I'll be\ntalking about three such ways two you\nprobably already know but they're worth\nsaying while the third has more of that\nspecial psychic sauce so let's get to it\nlet's start with the most obvious\napplication if you burn more calories\nthan you consume you will lose weight\nit's really that simple in fact there\nreally is no other reliable way to lose\nweight except by burning more calories\nthan you consume if you succeed in\nrestricting yourself in this way you\nwill sidestep at least half of the most\ncommon physical ailments that people are\nsubject to especially in the second half\nof Life which are compounded and\nexacerbated by being overweight\nand obese if this is you find a way to\nproduce more than you consume the time\nto take action is now\nthe second obvious application of this\nprinciple is to earn more than you spend\nlive within your means\nit's really that simple if you don't\nhave enough money for something\nunnecessary for survival do not buy it\ngetting into credit card debt is very\nvery easy getting out of credit card\ndebt is very very very hard the interest\nrates are criminal some are over 20\npercent it's really difficult to get out\nof credit card debt because any payments\nyou make are applied to the interest\nfirst which means it takes a long time\nto whittle down the principle you may\nend up paying three to five times as\nmuch in interest than the cost of the\nthing you bought this means that if you\ncan't afford to pay off your credit card\nat the end of the month you need to\nmultiply the price of whatever you want\nto buy three to five times that's the\ntrue cost to you you almost certainly do\nnot need that thing\nI don't care how much you make if your\nexpenses are less than your income\nyou're going to sidestep another\nenormous Pitfall that ensnares millions\nof people the laws here are stacked\nagainst you so it's better not to get\nyourself into that situation if you want\nsomething find ways to earn more money\ndon't borrow money on a credit card as\nyou increase your means you can increase\nyour expenditures to improve the quality\nof your life responsibly and gradually\nbe patient you'll actually get there\nfaster if you don't have to dig yourself\nout of debt on the way\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this episode to someone\nwho might benefit from its message it's\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nreally help to grow the channel and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then be sure to check out my top\nrated GRE self-study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow my third application of this\nprinciple isn't so obvious here it is\nyou need to create more than you absorb\nthere are some folks out there who are\njust absorbing content Non-Stop and this\ncan significantly distort their minds\nand skew their perception of the world\nfor instance some folks absorb hours of\npolitical commentary every day\nthey know what all the folks working in\ngovernment are doing and they have a\nvery good idea of what they should be\ndoing instead however while their\nabsorption may even have made them\nExperts of A Sort they do not create\nanything of political value\nI think there should be a rule after so\nmany years of absorbing political\ncontent people should actually have to\nget involved in politics otherwise they\nget cut off\nrun for office you can start locally\nthere are lots of things that need to\nget done at the town or county level I\nguarantee it\nthese folks will learn very quickly how\nthe sausage is made the experience is\nvery different when you're acting on\nstage versus muttering in the peanut\ngallery and the truth is you are not\nmeant to spend your whole life in the\npeanut gallery working as a Creator will\ngive you a much deeper and richer\nunderstanding of how things actually\nwork which will almost certainly redound\nto your beliefs and perceptions\nby the same token if you're spending\nhours scrolling through social media or\nwatching YouTube videos then at a\ncertain point you should actually get\ninvolved with creating content\nor get cut off\nstart a podcast or launch your own\nsocial media account I guarantee this\nwill drastically\naffect your perspective on things most\nsignificantly it will change how you\nperceive and value other people's\ncreations\nit's not good to consume more than you\nproduce and this is true intellectually\nas it is true physically and financially\nwhen people consume media non-stop their\nheads are actually full of other\npeople's ideas it gets to the point\nwhere it's actually very hard for them\nto think for themselves thinking\nindependently is difficult\neveryone thinks they can do it not many\npeople can it's very hard to have an\noriginal thought it takes time effort\nreflection creativity and insight\nhowever by consuming less and creating\nmore you can begin to suss out what\nactually belongs to you and what\nactually belongs to your parents culture\nand media\nthis is because creating is a way of\nmaking sense of what you've consumed if\nyou're consuming but not creating it's\nlike you're eating but you're not\n do you understand you're just\nfull of intake and that's going to leave\nyou bloated and disgusting\ncreation is a process in which you\ndigest what you've consumed it allows\nyou to take what is actually healthy and\nnutritious which in the intellectual\nsphere is what is true and useful and to\nrelieve yourself of the rest this is\nreally important\nso whatever you're consuming at a\ncertain point the time will come for you\nto go out there and create something\nwith it\ntry something anything within your\nabilities use it as an impetus to make\nsense of what you've consumed you'll\ncultivate agency and Independence and\nreal critical thought and it will\nabsolutely enrich your experience of\nwhatever you've been consuming what do\nyou think how do you create in your own\nlife let me know in the comments below\nand if you've gotten this far you might\nas well like this episode And subscribe\nto this channel\nyou might also consider becoming a\nchannel member with perks like priority\nreview
