    "transcript": "the idea that you just want to be nice\nto somebody is kind of if you really\njust want the other person to smile or\nto have an easier life or whatever then\nwould you offer the same gifts and\nsupport anonymously that's the real test\nwould you be okay with the other person\nnot knowing the good came from you or\neven thinking the good things came from\nsomebody else if you just want to make\ntheir lives better why would it matter\nbe real honest with yourself the vast\nmajority of people are seeking after\nsome form of positive regard and\nconsideration that comes as a result of\nbeing the acknowledged Giver of those\nresources and benefits and there's\nnothing necessarily wrong with that it\ndoesn't make you a bad person if you\nwant to be recognized for the good that\nyou do but it does make you a little\nself-deceptive if you won't admit that\neven to yourself on the other hand if\nyou're all right with giving without any\nexpectation if you are not bothered when\nyour good is repaid with bad then you\nmight be a virtuous person"
