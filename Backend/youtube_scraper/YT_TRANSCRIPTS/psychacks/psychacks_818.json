    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is rejecting\nwomen is a skill men this is extremely\nimportant to learn how to do for several\nreasons first and foremost you must\nunderstand that wanting is free that is\nit costs the wanter absolutely nothing\nto want things but it costs The Giver\nsomething to give things so there is\nactually this inherent asymmetry in\nwanting and giving wanting is free\ngiving is costly this is why it's\nactually a fairly decent interpersonal\nstrategy to want a lot of things this is\nbecause it's a low-cost low resource\nstrategy that every once in a while will\nactually succeed in securing The Wanted\nthing so it's almost like magic through\nwanting you are sometimes able to\nconjure value out of nothing simply by\nwanting it from the right person\nadd to this the social script that men\nare taught from Boyhood that their role\nis a provider in a relationship and you\nhave the perfect conditions for an\nunconscious reinforcement protocol on\nthe one hand there is little incentive\nfor women to stop wanting things from\nmen because at least every once in a\nwhile the wanting works so it's\nmaintained through variable reward\nschedules and on the other hand men are\noften punished for not giving women what\nthey want usually with emotional\npunishments like shame guilt-tripping\nand withholding and so the male behavior\nis maintained through negative\nreinforcement it's a simple trap but it\nensnares millions of men the fact of the\nmatter is that most people especially\nwomen will never stop wanting things\nfrom you and the more successful you\nbecome the more people will want more\nthings from you and this is certainly\ntrue in the sexual Marketplace the more\nsuccessful you are with women that is\nthe more optionality you have the more\ndesirable you are the more attractive\nyou become more women are going to want\nmore things from you their wanting is\nfree however your giving will cost you\ntime energy opportunity and money\nthis is why it is very very important to\nlearn how to reject women whether you\nlike it or not you have limited\nquantities of these resources and if you\nspend them as if they were unlimited you\nwill eventually find yourself depleted\nand alone this is because women\ngenerally don't stick around when you\nhave nothing left to give and among the\nvarious resources spent by givers the\nlimiting factor especially the more\nsuccessful you become\nis time time is your most precious\nresource simply wanting time is not\nsufficient grounds to give it\nI'd want my time too\nso just like you're not out there on the\nstreet handing out a hundred dollar\nbills to everyone who asks you can't\ngive your time to everyone who requests\nit men must learn to reject women now\nbefore I go any further if you're liking\nwhat you're hearing please consider\nsending this video to someone who might\nbenefit from its message its Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelp to make the channel grow and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool be sure to check out my personal\ntop rated GRE self-study program at\nStellar gre.com you can use 10 percent\nyou can use the coupon code psych to get\n10 off all membership plans it's\nfantastic\nnow the main reason why guys really\nstruggle with rejecting women besides\nthe cultural scripting mentioned earlier\nis scarcity mentality most men do not\nhave options with women and this puts\nthem in a place where it's really tough\nfor them to reject them even when the\nwomen are obviously not good for them\nit's like if I only had one client it\nwould be pretty tough for me to say no\nto that client even if his requests\ndeviated from my standard practice I'd\nbe caught between my values and my\nlivelihood which is a pretty difficult\nplace to be\nI might need that client more than that\nclient needs me\nwhich would put me in a disempowered\nposition relative to that client\nthis is why success and optionality can\nactually make men more virtuous\nas they are not pulled to compromise\ntheir values for any one person or\nopportunity\nso a lot of guys just can't fathom\nsaying no to a woman because that woman\nis like their only client however let's\nnow assume that you're actually a\nsuccessful guy who has increased\noptionality with women\nanother reason why guys struggle with\nrejecting women is that for lack of a\nbetter word they fear their emotional\nresponse they are afraid that saying no\nwill provoke the woman's anger or\njeopardize the continuation of the\nrelationship and let's be real that can\ncertainly happen\nthere are a lot of entitled women out\nthere who are used to being Daddy's\nLittle Princess and have not experienced\nenough personal rejection from men she\nhas yet to develop the emotional callous\nthat would enable her to treat no as\ninformation and not a personal affront\nso while it's possible that a woman May\nstorm out of your life if you don't give\nher what she wants it's probably for the\nbest that she created a vacancy\na lot of guys fear this negative\nemotional reaction because of the way\nthat they were brought up\nmaybe they grew up with mothers or\nsisters who were tyrannical and\nemotionally manipulative and with\nfathers or brothers who were unwilling\nor unable to stand up to them spending\nthe first 18 years of their lives in\nthis environment trains men to believe\nfrom a very young age that a\nrelationship with a woman is predicated\non catering to her desires or else\nand that is absolutely not the basis of\na healthy or fulfilling relationship for\neither party\nhowever if a man does not challenge this\nscript he can find himself in all kinds\nof really difficult relationships as an\nadult\nso you need to be able to reject women\nin order to safeguard your limited\nresources but why is this a skill\nit's a skill because you can learn to\nreject women\nin ways that actually make them feel\nbetter as a result\nbelieving that rejecting another person\nwill hurt them is kind of a\nself-fulfilling prophecy if you go into\nan interaction with the assumption that\nyou're about to deliver a painful\nhurtful piece of news that will be\ndifficult for the other person to hear\nyou might be training the other person\nto feel hurt as a consequence of your\ndelivery\nconsider the possibility that you could\nactually leave a woman better than you\nfound her as a result of rejecting her\ndon't believe me let me give you a quick\nexample from my own life several years\nago I had a first date with a woman we\nmet for a drink had an easy flirtatious\nconversation with good chemistry and\nwent our separate ways a week later I\ntexted her to schedule a second date two\nminutes after I sent the text she called\nme on the phone\nand we had a three minute conversation\nthat I swear to God\nbasically went like this she said Orion\nI got your invitation and here's the\nthing\nI know based on our date last week that\nyou're a man that I could fall deeply\npassionately in love with\nyou're attractive you're intelligent\nyou're successful\nyou have everything that I'm looking for\nin a man\nand because of that I'm afraid of losing\nmyself in a relationship with you\nso while I'm tempted by what you're\noffering I have to stay away\nas I'm just so attracted to you and\nwouldn't know how to control myself\nand I said all right well thanks for\nletting me know and if you change your\nmind you know how to find me and we hung\nup and I left that conversation feeling\nlike a million bucks I mean what just\nhappened this woman said no to me she\nsaid no to a second date let's not have\nany Illusions about this she rejected me\nbut she rejected me in such a way that I\nfelt really good about being rejected\nher rejection was like a compliment\nnow she was probably just feeding me a\nline but that doesn't really matter the\npoint is that rejection doesn't have to\nbe a painful hurtful experience for the\nrecipient if you approach it in the\nright way\nthis is why rejecting women is a skill\nand all successful men must Master it\nwhat do you think does this fit with\nyour own experience let me know in the\ncomments below and if
