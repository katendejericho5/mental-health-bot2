    "transcript": "the real danger with weed is not that\nit's acutely dangerous but that it kind\nof makes the users shitty situation more\ntolerable which allows it to continue\nmuch longer through time and in this way\nweed keeps folks gently trapped for\nyears in circumstances that they might\nlong ago have been able to change now\nwhen folks stop using and they come into\nincreased emotional contact with how\nunpleasant their situation is things get\nharder things get worse however that's\nactually kind of a good thing that's\nbecause miserable situations are\nunsustainable weed makes a potentially\nmiserable situation tolerable if on the\nother hand you remove that tolerance and\nyou feel the reality of your situation\nyou will do things to escape that pain I\nguarantee it even suicidally depressed\npeople run out of burning buildings you\nmay have previously been using weed to\nescape that pain but if that root is now\nblocked by your will you will find other\nways to get out"
