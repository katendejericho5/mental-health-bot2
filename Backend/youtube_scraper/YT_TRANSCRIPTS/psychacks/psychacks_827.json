    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the most\ncommon male sexual strategy this episode\nis going to be a little different\nbecause it is a sponsored episode I'm\ngoing to read the email that I received\nfrom this particular listener and then\nkind of Riff Off of My ideas contained\ntherein so let's jump right into it this\none comes from Daniel C and it reads\nhi Ryan so I've noticed that a lot of\nyour advice is geared towards dating EG\nfinding the right woman to have an\neffortless relationship walking away if\nnecessary what is the advice that you\nwould have for somebody like myself who\nhas already been married for 12 years\nwith two kids and who has spent the\nfirst 37 years of their life doing the\nexact opposite of what an attractive man\nshould be doing such as engaging the\nwife through logic being the adore and\nputting her on the pedestal allowing her\nto Captain our relationship negotiating\nsex through overt and covert contracts\nbeing a people pleaser an all-around\nnice guy who's an introvert and not very\nexciting or charming to boot\num tragically for the first 37 years of\nmy life I thought I was right and that\nmy wife was wrong for not seeing things\nmy way\nas such my Beta or Nice Guy behaviors\nare deeply ingrained in my subconscious\nthat'll happen this new world of\npsychology emotions game and passion is\noverwhelming and I'm not quite sure\nwhere to begin what are the baby steps\nthat I need to take and the mindset that\nI should have going forward is my\nrelationship a lost cause will I be able\nto change my wife's impression of me\neventually\nguards all right so\nthis is a very common story that I hear\nfrom men both in my therapeutic practice\nand among those I do consultations with\nthe way I'm going to summarize it is\nthat they have realized\nalready in a pre-existing relationship\nthat their strategies for maintaining\nattraction from their woman are\nunsustainable and this is because they\nutilized\nwhat is unfortunately the most common\nmale sexual strategy that does not\nproduce long-standing results in\nheterosexual relationships let me\nexplain what that is first then I'll\ntalk about whether it's possible to\nchange it is but not with a great deal\nof effort unfortunately so\nif you haven't done so already check out\nmy episode on the sexual Marketplace in\nwhich I describe the sexual Marketplace\nas sort of like a dock where there are\nmen who are selling their services as\nship captains and women who are going\naround and sort of checking out the\nvessels and the itineraries of all the\nvarious offerings and if a woman likes\nthe ship in the itinerary of a\nparticular Captain she can get on that\nboat and the two of them can ride off\ninto the horizon\nnow that's\nso the most common way that men attempt\nto attract women down at the sexual\nMarketplace\nis to advertise their ship as a means\nto the woman's end\nbasically the man is saying hey if you\nget on this boat I'll take you where you\nwant to go\nso A boat like this we call a ferry\nwhich is basically like a water taxi\nyou're hiring this ship to go towards\nyour destination\ndo you understand and there are many\nwomen who find that proposition\nattractive great\nif I go with this person I can get there\nfaster safer and more reliably and he's\nwilling to take me where I want to go\nthis sounds not like too bad of a deal\nto me\nnow here's the thing a lot of guys don't\nactually want to be fairy captains\nthey're using this as a strategy to get\nthe woman on the boat the issue is you\ncan't really ever stop being a fairy\nCaptain imagine that you were like\ntaking a a cap and you took that cab for\n12 years and that driver took you where\nyou wanted to go hundreds and hundreds\nand hundreds of times\nif one day you got in that cab and the\nguy turned around and said hey you know\nI've been taking you to your destination\nfor the last 12 years I was kind of\nwondering if maybe we could switch roles\nand you could get up here in the\ndriver's seat and take me to where I\nwant to go for a change\nyou're gonna get the [ __ ] out of that\ncab because that's not the point of a\ncab not ever there is never a point in\nthe cab fairy relationship in which the\ncab driver gets to stop being the driver\nof the passenger's destination do you\nunderstand\num that's not what that woman signed up\nfor and I can understand\nher potential indignation at the offer\nbecause it's almost like is is this like\na fake cab that's not how cabs operate\nand that's how you advertised yourself\nyou made it clear that you wanted to\ntake me where I wanted to go and that's\nwhy I got on your ship dude\num I'm didn't sign up for switching\nroles here\nso be if you found yourself in this\nsituation it's a it's kind of a a decent\nway to get your foot in the door\num but it creates this long-term trap\nbecause you can't ever really deviate\nfrom that role do you understand\nso\nit's possible to change the dynamic but\nit takes a lot of intention and patience\nwhy is that\nif you want to change a behavior within\nyour relationship especially that\nbehavior has been long standing and is\nassociated with some sort of\nreinforcement and reward to the other\nparty\nwhat you'll experience when you try to\ndo that is what's called an Extinction\nburst it happened in the little\nmetaphorical story I gave where the\nwhere you were like what give me the\n[ __ ] out of this cab this is not what I\nsigned up for that's an Extinction burst\nif you try to mess with somebody's\nreward protocols\num it's not going to go over well and an\nExtinction burst is an intensification\nof the exact Behavior you're trying to\nextinguish as a means of trying to put\nmore\num\ninfluence on maintaining the status quo\nso it's very very hard to break out of\nthe status quo because when most people\nattempt to change they experience this\nex Extinction burst which can be really\noverwhelming and chaotic\nand a lot of guys unfortunately then\njust say oh okay it's not worth it if\nthis is going to be the outcome and they\ngo back to whatever they were doing\nbefore it's almost like the woman kind\nof used her emotions to bully the guy\nback in the fairy role which is what he\nsigned up for to begin with\ndo you understand so you really can't go\nabout trying to change your relationship\nuntil you are very prepared to weather\nthe emotional storm that is almost\ncertainly going to result from changing\nthe reinforcement Protocols of that\nrelationship\nbut if you're willing to do that you\nbegin by targeting very specific\nbehaviors and you do this intentionally\nideally with a therapist or a coach\nbecause you might not really know\nwhat is a more effective Behavior if you\nhave been doing this for the last 12 or\n37 years of your life\num and to Target kind of one thing at a\ntime you definitely do not sit down with\nthe woman and say I am going to be\nmaking some changes I'm going to be\nreinforcing this behavior I'm going to\nbe not reinforcing this behavior and I'd\nI'd like this to be the result\nyou that's not going to work so instead\nyou focus simply on changing how you\nshow up in the relationship\nand that's going to force some kind of\nchange in your system\nbecause in a system it's not possible\nfor one part to change without sort of\ninfluencing some kind of a change in the\nother parts with which it is commingled\nthe issue is we don't know exactly what\nthat change is going to be so it is a\nbit risky the upshot here is that it's\npossible to change a long-standing\ndynamic within a relationship but it's\nalways always always better\nto start a new relationship\nwith the end in mind\nbecause if you do kind of a bait and\nswitch thing to use the strategy of I'll\ntake you where I want to go to get the\nwoman on your boat hoping that further\ndown the line you can have some sort of\nreciprocity\nthat's not going to work you should\nstart from the very beginning\npracticing with that particular woman\nthe relationship you would like to have\nwith her in 12 years\nokay\num kind of a long talk hopefully that\nmakes sense to you guys if you would\nlike\nto share this with somebody
