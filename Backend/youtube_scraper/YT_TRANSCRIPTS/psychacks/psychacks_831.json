    "transcript": "hypergamy is the tendency of women to\ndate up and across which is why women\ntend to date and mate with men who are\nolder taller stronger wealthier and\nhigher status this means literally and\nfiguratively a woman wants to look up to\nher man if a man insists on being the\nadore then he's looking up at her which\nmeans that she is looking down at him\nand that is definitely not a sustainable\nrelationship men you don't allow a woman\nto look up to you you don't even give\nher the chance if you're looking up at\nher I get that you want to be the adorer\nbut here's the thing if you insist on\nhaving that experience you are robbing\nher of the opportunity of having that\nexperience because you can't both be\nadorers so what I'd like you to consider\nis making a voluntary sacrifice to be\nthe adored"
