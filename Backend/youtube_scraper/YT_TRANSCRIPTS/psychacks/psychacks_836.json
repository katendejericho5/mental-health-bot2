    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the most\ntoxic relationship belief unfortunately\nthe most toxic relationship belief is\none of the most ubiquitous on this\nplanet it's toxic because it appears so\nbenign in reality enacters of disbelief\ntend to corrode a relationship From the\nInside Out\nsimultaneously believing that they are\nentirely justified in doing so which\nmeans that people go on to perpetuate\nthe same error in future relationships\nexternalizing blame while feeling\nself-righteous happens all the time okay\nso what is this toxic belief it's very\nsimple in fact it's so simple you might\nnot believe me when I tell it to you so\nI'm going to ask you to please listen\nthrough to the rest of the episode so I\ncan help you make sense of this\nhere it is\nthe most toxic relationship belief is\nmy relationship is where I am free to be\nmyself\nI told you you probably weren't going to\nbelieve me however this belief destroys\nrelationships now you might be thinking\nDr Orion are you saying that we should\nbe lying and faking in our relationships\nno it does not that's a strong man\nargument what I'm saying is that you are\nnot free to be fully and completely\nyourself in a relationship\nthis belief is toxic because the people\nwho endorse it tend to live their lives\nlike this\ntheir implicit framework is out there\nout there in the world that's where I\nhave to act when I'm at my job I have to\nput on a smile and do what my boss tells\nme when I'm on the bus I have to\ntolerate the rudeness and the body odor\nwhen I'm with my family I have to be a\ngood daughter or the firstborn son and\nsometimes even with my friends I have to\npretend to be interested in Marlene's\nlatest interpersonal drama or Steven's\nill remembered recapitulation of\nwhatever the media has encouraged him to\nthink but in my relationships that's\nwhere I get to let it all go that's\nwhere I just get to be myself I don't\nhave to try I don't have to perform I\ndon't have to generate value my\nrelationship is where I get to drop all\nrole-playing be accepted unconditionally\nand finally be myself that is a toxic\nbelief\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message its\nWord of Mouth referrals like this that\nactually really help to grow the channel\nand if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school please be sure to check out\nmy top rated GRE self-study course at\nStellar gre.com you can use the coupon\ncode psych to get 10 off all membership\nplans\nthe fact of the matter is that a\nrelationship or at least a good\nrelationship\nis a privilege much like a job or at\nleast a good job\nis a privilege\nnobody thinks that they should be able\nto just be themselves at work\ndoes that mean that people are lying and\nfaking at work I'm sure some of them are\nhowever a better way of thinking about\nit is that most people are channeling a\nversion of themselves at work that is\nconducive to professionalism which is\nwhat we tend to socially expect from\npeople occupying a professional role and\nwhy do we expect this because it eases\nthe professional relationship\nit is easier to do business with someone\nwho is acting professionally than it is\nto do business with someone acting\nunprofessionally wouldn't you agree\nso professionalism is a version of\nyourself that is appropriate to a\nspecific kind of role because it\nfacilitates the transaction of value\ndoes that make sense\nthe same thing is true for your intimate\nrelationships\nboyfriend is a role wife is a role this\nmeans that we tend to have certain\nexpectations of people occupying such\nroles and why do we expect this because\nit eases the intimate relationship\nfacilitating the transaction of value\nwhich is why the people are there\nand assuming that you have a good\nboyfriend or girlfriend or husband or\nwife it is a privilege to occupy that\nrole I hate to break it to you but the\nonly time when you are free to be\nyourself is when you are alone\nyou may not want to hear it but it's the\ntruth\nrelationships are roles\nsome of that role is socially determined\nand some of that role is defined by\nnegotiated expectations but a role is a\nrole saying or doing things that\nconflict with the expectations of that\nrole is going to go over\nin that relationship about as well as\nsaying or doing things that conflict\nwith professionalism will at work\nand the most common way that people\nconflict with their relationship roles\nis by slacking off\nat work you have to do your job\nevery single day\nyou do not reach a point at work where\nyou get to stop trying\nevery day you have to show up and\ndeliver\nyou need some time off you take some\ntime off but you do not get to clock in\nand not make an effort if you fail to do\nso\npeople will fail to pay you and this is\nentirely reasonable\npaying you for not making an effort is\nbeing complicit\nin your own robbery\nand if this is something that is\ndifficult for you to understand then\nperhaps the privilege of a job isn't for\nyou\na relationship is no different\nyou have to show up every single day you\ndo not reach a point in your\nrelationship where you get to stop\ntrying\nevery day you have to show up and\ndeliver you need some time to yourself\nyou take some time to yourself but you\ndo not get to clock in and not make an\neffort if you fail to do so\npeople will fail to compensate you with\nthe benefits of a relationship and this\nis entirely reasonable\ncompensating you for not making an\neffort is being complicit in the theft\nof your time among other things\nand if this is something that is\ndifficult for you to understand then\nperhaps the privilege of a relationship\nisn't for you\nlet me give you a very specific example\nof how this commonly presents itself in\nheterosexual relationships I often hear\nmen complaining to me that when their\nwoman wakes up in the morning she puts\non a smart looking outfit she puts on\nhigh-heeled shoes she puts on her makeup\nand then she goes out to work\nbut then she takes off that makeup and\nchanges into sweatpants when she comes\nhome in the evening when she is free to\nbe herself\nladies\nI understand that it might be more\ncomfortable to wear sweatpants around\nthe house but I guarantee you what your\nman is thinking is\nwhy does the stranger that you interact\nwith professionally get to enjoy a more\nattractive version of you than I do\nwhy are you more charming and\npresentable with customers than you are\nwith me\nand given the fact that I'm investing a\nlot in this relationship I'm starting to\nfeel hurt and cheated because you seem\nto be making less of an effort\nthis is a small example of how a\nrelationship can be corroded From the\nInside Out by failing to live up to role\nexpectations\nif you approach relationships like roles\nand if you perform those roles capably\nthen you get to enjoy the Privileges of\nthose relationships and if you stop\nperforming those roles capably then over\ntime you compromise your right to occupy\nthat place\nthis means that you are not free to be\nyourself in a relationship\nthat said you are free to express those\nparts of yourself that are most\nconducive to that role within your\nrelationship\nand if you do that successfully you make\nthe relationship easy\nwhich facilitates the transaction of\nvalue\nwhat do you think\nis there benefit to approaching\nrelationships like roles let me know in\nthe comments below and if you've gotten\nthis far you might as well
