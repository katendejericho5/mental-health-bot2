    "transcript": "why is disrespecting men bad for women\nwe can approach the answer in two ways\nin the first place a man who has any\nself-worth whatsoever and who enjoys any\nkind of optionality in the sexual\nMarketplace will not tolerate disrespect\nso the woman being overtly or covertly\ndisrespectful may be jeopardizing what\ncould otherwise be a fulfilling and\nrewarding relationship for her the\nsecond reason disrespecting men not only\nthreatens the women's relationships it\nalso threatens their positive\nemotionality it is not possible for a\nwoman to love a man she does not respect\nfor a woman where the respect goes the\nlove follows disrespect not only\nthreatens the relationship it threatens\nthe love in her heart it threatens the\nwoman's own positive regard men nipping\ncovert disrespect in the bud is\nabsolutely essential to the long-term\nhealth of your relationship"
