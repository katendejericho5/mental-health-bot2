    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\naddressing female disrespect\nthis is an extremely important topic\nboth for men and women so I hope\neveryone will be listening carefully to\ntoday's talk let's Jump Right In\nthe first thing that's important to\nunderstand is that disrespect is\ntypically a process\nit happens gradually over time\nthe best predictor of overt disrespect\nis covert disrespect which are small\nbehaviors that have plausible\ndeniability\nso if you don't want to have a larger\nproblem on your hands further down the\nroad it's important to address\ndisrespect while it is still in its\nsmaller forms\nthe clearest examples of the process of\ndisrespect are seen in high schools and\nprisons\na bully doesn't usually go straight to\nshaking down his Target that's actually\npretty risky if he doesn't know who he's\ndealing with he could always pick the\nwrong guy to mess with and that's going\nto make his life more difficult and\ncomplicated than he intended\nso what these folks tend to do is they\nkind of test their victim\nclassic example is bumping into their\ntarget as they're crossing paths in a\nhallway and seeing how he responds this\nis a subtle test because there's some\nplausible deniability here like oh well\nmaybe this person just wasn't looking\nwhere he was going it happens sometimes\npeople jostle into each other\nhowever\nif the bully bumps into the target\nand the target says excuse me\nthat person is now pegged as a target\nfor escalation\non the other hand if the target were to\nrespond appropriately and cast a warning\nglance at the bully or issue a verbal\nwarning that bully could always play it\noff whoa hey man chill out what got you\nso worked up\nbut he would probably think twice about\nescalating the situation\nnow the issue is that most bullies kinda\nknow that they're bullies\nand while women absolutely can be\nbullies that is they are intentionally\nusing tactics to inflict emotional or\npsychological pain in order to get what\nthey want\nI also believe that a lot of women women\nactually aren't aware of how they may be\ncommunicating disrespect to men and this\nis because at least in part respect\nmeans different things to men and women\nnow before I go any further if you're\nliking what you're hearing please\nconsider sending this video to someone\nwho might benefit from its message its\nWord of Mouth referrals like that that\nreally help to grow this Channel and if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then you need to check out my top\nrated GRE self-study course at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nnow at this point I'm going to offer the\nwomen in the audience a really simple\ntest to determine whether a behavior is\nlikely going to be perceived as\ndisrespectful to a man\nhere it is\nwith respect to any Behavior just ask\nyourself\nwould I say the same thing in the same\nway to my boss if I was interested in\nkeeping my job\nif the answer to that question is no\ncongratulations you potentially have a\ndisrespectful behavior on your hands\nif you are interested in keeping your\njob would you roll your eyes at your\nboss\nwould you be dismissive of your boss's\nfeedback would you complain angrily\nwould you respond to your boss's\nrequests sarcastically\nwould you nag your boss to comply with\nyour demands would you mutter under your\nbreath when your boss talks at meetings\nwould you talk badly about your boss\nwith your co-workers behind his back\nwould you tease your boss would you be\nopenly indifferent or uninterested in\nyour boss's proposals\nwould you mock your boss's attempts to\nmaintain order and discipline\nI think most of us understand that if\nwe're interested in keeping our jobs the\nanswer to all of those questions is no\nand for the three percent of you out\nthere listening to this who are now\nsaying to yourselves well Ryan actually\nI I tease my boss all the time we have a\nreally warm and playful relationship\nokay then the question for you becomes\nwould you act like that with your boss\nin front of other clients or customers\nof course not and why is that because\nyou know how that behavior would come\noff to other people who are not\ninitiated into your special little\ndynamic and this means that you\nunderstand my point\nnow before I address why this behavior\nis detrimental to women's best interests\nlet me respond to the most common\nobjection I usually receive at this\npoint in my argument in short the\nobjection is some variant of that's nice\nbut a man is not the boss of me\nokay fair enough\nhowever your boss is not the boss of you\neither\nyou're not his slave\nhe can't make you do things that you\ndon't want to do you are a participant\nin an at-will professional relationship\nhe's not the boss of you however he is\nthe boss of you in a professional\ncontext or even better he's the boss of\nthe employees which is a role that you\nvoluntarily agreed to assume and within\nthat Dynamic the boss has legitimate\nauthority to make reasonable demands of\nand set reasonable expectations for his\nemployees\nthe person who builds the frame or to\nuse my sexual Marketplace metaphor\nbuilds the ship is the boss or captain\nthis is not always the man but it\ngenerally is why because it's usually\nmen making bids to women to enter into\ntheir Lifestyles not the other way\naround\nhowever even if you disagree with that\nperspective a valid retort to the\nobjection I previously stated would be\nwhy do you feel that your boss is\nentitled to a higher level of respect\nthan I am\ngo shack up with that guy or see how he\nputs up with your on his time\noff\nLadies If you communicate if you\ndisrespect your man in ways that you\nwouldn't disrespect your boss you are\nfunctionally communicating that your\nprofessional relationship with your boss\nis more valuable to you than your\nintimate relationship with your man and\nmaybe for you it is\nand the communication is appropriate no\nproblem however if it isn't you should\nbe aware that you may be communicating\nthis message inadvertently\nall right so why is disrespecting men\nbad for women\nwe can approach the answer in two ways\nin the first place a man who has any\nself-worth whatsoever\nand who enjoys any kind of optionality\nin the sexual Marketplace will not\ntolerate disrespect\nso the woman being overtly or covertly\ndisrespectful she may be jeopardizing\nwhat could otherwise be a fulfilling and\nrewarding relationship for her that's\nkind of the obvious reason but here's\nthe second reason and it's a little\nspicier\ndisrespecting men not only threatens the\nwomen's relationships\nit also threatens their positive\nemotionality\nthis is because it is not possible for a\nwoman to love a man she does not respect\nit is possible for a man to love a woman\nhe does not respect that happens every\nday however it is not possible for a\nwoman to love a man she does not respect\none of the many differences between men\nand women\nfor a woman where the respect goes the\nlove follows\nso disrespect not only threatens the\nrelationship it threatens the love in\nher heart it threatens the woman's own\npositive regard\nmen nipping covert disrespect in the bud\nis absolutely essential to the long-term\nhealth of your relationship addressing\nit is a way to safeguard her positive\nregard for you\nif the disrespect is allowed to continue\nwithout consequence not only will the\nbehavior likely become increasingly\nproblematic\nbut the high interest and attraction you\nmay currently enjoy which are the\nconditions of her continued loyalty\nwill be jeopardized compromising the\nsustainability of the relationship\nunderstand this is a long video but it's\nan important subject what do you think\nwhat is your experience with covert\ndisrespect let me know in the comments\nbelow and if you've gotten this far you\nmight as well like the episode And\nsubscribe to the channel\nthanks for listening"
