    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is in a good\nrelationship the transaction is\ninvisible so the fundamental thesis of\nmy forthcoming book the value of others\nis that relationships are the media in\nwhich value is transacted where no value\nis transacted no relationship exists nor\ncan a relationship exist on the other\nhand the mere transaction of value is\nboth necessary and sufficient to have a\nrelationship now the idea that all\nvoluntary relationships are at heart\ntransactional can rub people the wrong\nway sometimes it rubs people the wrong\nway due to a deficit of insight or\nself-awareness however it can also rub\npeople the wrong way because this\nposition kind of runs counter to their\nfelt experience like these people are in\nrelationships that they don't experience\nas transactional they don't think of\ntheir relationships in this sense and\nthey certainly don't feel like it fits\nwith respect to their particular\ncase however like so many other things\njust because we can't see the\ntransaction doesn't mean it's not there\nassuming sufficient Insight the reason\nwhy people might not see the transaction\nat the heart of their relationships is\nbecause their relationships are working\nyou see in a good relationship ship the\ntransaction is invisible it's only when\nthe relationship becomes unsatisfying or\ndysfunctional that most people can catch\na glimpse of that transaction allow me\nto\nexplain like many people I'm in a\ntransactional relationship with a power\ncompany in exchange for money they\ndeliver electricity into my house a\nwhile back I set up automatic payments\nto this company which functionally means\nthat I can go months without even\nthinking about this utility when I flip\na switch the lights come on and when\nthey push a button they receive their\npayment with respect to our own\ntransacted Goods everything is\neffortless and mutually beneficial even\nthough both of us are functionally\npursuing our own self-interest in a\nstrictly regulated contractual\nrelationship so long as we are both\ngetting what we want the transaction is\ninvisible and I'm going to be satisfied\nwith this relationship in inverse\nproportion to how much I notice the\ntransaction that serves as the basis of\nour\nrelationship because when am I going to\nnotice this transaction not when things\nare going well when things are going\nwell the transaction is invisible I'm\ngoing to notice the transaction when\nthings are going badly let me tell you\nwhen I experience a power a power outage\nI am very aware of the transactional\nnature of our relationship I'm thinking\nI'm paying x amount every month as a\nutility fee irrespective of my my\nkilowatt hours and I subsidized their\ninfrastructure with my tax money this is\nan outrage they had one job and\nthey couldn't even do that etc etc etc\nby the same token if I ever were to stop\npaying my utility bill the transactional\nnature of our relationship would become\nhighly visible to the Energy company\nthey would undertake increasingly\naggressive efforts to recoup their loss\nand if they couldn't they would\nultimately shut my power off and I don't\nthink any person would consider these\nresponses to be somehow\nunreasonable now the same thing holds\ntrue for our romantic relationships when\nwe feel like we're getting a good trade\nthat is when we're getting at least as\nmuch as we're getting then the\ntransactional element is completely\ninvisible to us we're not thinking about\nit we're not talking about it and we\ndon't feel that it even exists we just\nkind of think I'm in this relationship\nbecause I love this person the\ntransactional nature of the relationship\nonly becomes visible and apparent when\nthings start to go wrong trust me if you\nstart to give more and get less you're\ngoing to become increasingly cognizant\nof that Dynamic over time and of course\nthat would only be a problem if\nrelationships were\ntransactional now before I go any\nfurther if you're liking what you're\nhearing please consider sending this\nepisode to someone who might benefit\nfrom its message because it's Word of\nMouth referrals like this that really\nhelped to make the channel grow I'm also\nproud to announce that my book the value\nof others is now available for pre-sale\non Amazon I'm also writing original\ncontent for my free newsletter every\nweek so if you'd like to sign up you can\ndo so on my website finally please fill\nout an inquiry form on my website if\nyou're interested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription let's get back to\nit if relationships weren't\ntransactional and they just ran on love\nor Vibes or whatever then it shouldn't\nmatter whether you were getting a raw\ndeal\nthe transaction should remain just as\ninvisible when things are going poorly\nas when things are going well but that\nis decidedly not what happens people\nstart to think things like you know I'm\ndoing a lot more of the housework around\nhere or I really think we should be\nhaving more sex than we do and what\nthese comments and countless others\neffectively communicate is I'm noticing\nthat I'm giving more value than I'm\ngetting in return and that perceived\nunfairness is reducing my ability to\nenthusiastically remain in this\nrelationship it's just like me paying\nfor electricity that isn't being\ndelivered when people feel like they're\nnot getting enough of what they want\ngiven their investment in the\nrelationship in terms of time energy\nmoney commitment Etc then the\ntransaction becomes visible and when\nthey are getting enough of what they\nwant given their investment in the\nrelationship or the perceived unfairness\nis adequately addressed then the the\ntransaction once again Fades into\ninvisibility that doesn't mean that it's\nnot there it just means that it doesn't\nrequire attention and it doesn't require\nattention because it's\nworking what makes relationships so\nchallenging is not that they are\ntransactional in fact if we were\ncollectively more accepting and explicit\nabout this reality we would all probably\nhave an easier time with things what\nmakes relationships so challenging is\nthat the Goods being transacted are\ntypically not explicitly negotiated and\nacknowledged and are subject to all\nkinds of change and fluctuation over\ntime my relationship with my power\ncompany is easy because we're both\nconsciously exchanging one thing for one\nthing electricity for money and that\nholds true over time now imagine you're\nexchanging many things of fluctuating\nvalue outside of both parties conscious\nawareness\nthe fact that some people find a way to\ndo this indefinitely is nothing short of\nmiraculous however one of their secrets\nmight be in how these people count like\nhow people calculate how much they give\nand how much they get is subject to all\nkinds of squirl this is because in\ngeneral people overvalue what they give\nand undervalue what they get which is\nobviously a serious problem if Rel\nrelationships are essentially\ntransactional so if you're going for\nlongevity it's kind of a good idea to\nconsciously correct these biases that is\nslightly undervalue what you give and\nslightly overvalue what you get what's\nmore it's also a good idea not to count\ntoo\nprecisely the closer you measure the\nvalue of what you give and get the more\ntransactional your relationship is going\nto feel and remember the awareness of\ntransaction is generally characteristic\nof bad relationships so bringing that\nawareness into your relationship is\nprobably going to diminish subjective\nSatisfaction by\nassociation so punctilious and\noverzealous measurement is not a good\nidea on the other hand people in\nrelationships that Go the Distance kind\nof take a fuzzy look at the numbers and\nthe transaction of value they don't look\ntoo closely at the economic exchange\nthis doesn't necessarily mean that these\nfolks are turning a die to dysfunctional\nor exploitative Dynamics it just kind of\nmeans that they're okay with the\nexchange residing in a rather broad\nconfidence interval that they are\nwilling to make allowances for exchange\nfluctuations Over time however even\nWithin These relationship strategies if\nyour partner started to do much less and\nyou continued on as usual or even\nstarted doing much more to pick up the\nslack then this will tend to create\ndissatisfaction conflict and resentment\nover time and this kind of wouldn't be\npossible unless relationships were\ntransactional whether we like it or not\nour feelings are tied to the perception\nof value in a very deep and very\npowerful way which is a theme that I\nexplore in much greater detail in my\nforthcoming book so stay tuned what do\nyou think does this fit with
