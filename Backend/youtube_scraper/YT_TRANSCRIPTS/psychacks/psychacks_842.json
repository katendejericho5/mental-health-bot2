    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is what you\nneed to heal a betrayal\nso betrayals are subject to occurring\nwithin relationships and I'm going to be\nhonest with you they are very hard to\nwork through in many respects it is\noften easier to start over with a new\nrelationship than it is to heal a\nbetrayal in a pre-existing relationship\nthis might not be what you want to hear\nbut I don't want to you however\nlet's assume that you are interested in\nworking through a betrayal with your\ncurrent partner what then\nwell one thing you have to understand is\nthat violating trust is basically like\nfolding a piece of paper you can kind of\nfold it back in the opposite direction\nand work out the damage but that paper\nis going to be creased forever to some\nextent the relationship will never go\nback to the way it was before the\nawareness of the Betrayal occurred\nbut before I explain how to actually\nwork out this crease please remember to\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto help spread this message so if you\nlike what you're hearing then please do\nthe thing\nand if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school be sure to check out my\nonline self-study program at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the code psych for\n10 off all membership plans\nall right there are two things that need\nto occur in order to have any kind of\nreasonable prognosis that the healing\nprocess here will actually be successful\naction is required from both parties so\nboth people need to be very honest with\nthemselves before agreeing to start off\nthis process\nso what needs to happen well in the\nfirst place the transgressor the one who\nviolated the trust\nneeds to non-defensively accept\nresponsibility for the transgression\nand commit himself or herself to a\ncourse of corrective action with full\ntransparency afforded to the transgress\nparty\nif the transgressor isn't willing to\ntake full responsibility for the\ntransgression then it's a non-starter\nassuming partial responsibility yeah I\ndid this but only because you did that\nis also not associated with a positive\nprognosis\nhowever accepting responsibility is not\nenough after all the best apology is\nchanged Behavior\nwhat is going to be different moving\nforward\nthat is the commitment to corrective\naction which could mean surrendering a\nrelationship going to therapy or\nreceding to other reasonable demands and\nthis corrected action cannot be done in\nprivate as this is where the Betrayal\noccurred transparent accountability is\nessential at least for a time to restore\ntrust after a betrayal\nthis phase of the process can take six\nmonths to a year sometimes more\ndepending on the magnitude of the\nBetrayal it will be time consuming\nexpensive and difficult so transgressors\nreally need to be honest with themselves\nabout their willingness to surrender to\nthis probationary period that will\nlikely require significant effort and\nbehavioral change\nif you don't think you can do this or if\nyou don't want to do this\nit might just be better to move on\nhowever\nthis is only half of the equation the\ntransgressed party also requires a\nhealthy dose of self-honesty albeit in a\nslightly different manner this person\nneeds to determine whether if the\ntransgressor were to complete this\ntransparent course in corrective action\nhe or she would act\nactually willing to move on\nwhich means to Let It Go\nand never bring it up again\nand this can be extremely hard why well\nbesides the pain and hurt engendered by\nbetrayals there's a lot of secondary\ngain that can accrue to the transgressed\nparty as a consequence of that very\nbetrayal on some level we believe that\nthe injured party now has the\njustifiable power to dictate the terms\nof the relationship\nbecause of X now I get to go through\nyour phone or now you have to report\ninto me on the hour or now you have to\nask my permission to do things there is\na measure of power and control that is\npredicated on the continuance of their\nvictim status and so unsurprisingly\nthere can be resistance to letting go of\nthe Betrayal on the part of the\ntransgressed because letting go of the\nBetrayal means simultaneously letting go\nof the Privileges that can accrue to\noccupying a position of victimhood\nand that will likely destroy the\nrelationship\nthe transgressor is going to think hey\nyou know I've jumped through all these\nhoops I've demonstrated my good faith\nI've tried my best I've served my time\nand you still don't trust me\nthat's not what I signed up for\nif conditions are met the transgressed\nhas to be willing to forgive the\nBetrayal completely\nthis means that they don't get to bring\nit up and hold it over the other person\nin a fight years after the fact this is\nan emotional manipulation strategy to\nsecure leverage in a relationship and\nit's toxic\nI'm not saying that the transgressed\nparty should be able to completely\nforgive any betrayal what I'm saying is\nthat if the transgress party can't\ncompletely forgive the Betrayal for\nwhatever reason\nhe or she probably stood and shouldn't\nstill be in a relationship with the\ntransgressor and it might just be better\nto move on\nwithout these two things full\nresponsibility and a transparent course\nof corrective action on the one hand and\na willingness to completely forgive the\nBetrayal of conditions are met on the\nother\nthere is honestly little point to trying\nto work things out\nhealing a betrayal is time consuming\ndifficult and expensive there is no\nguarantee that it will work even under\nideal circumstances and without those\ntwo conditions which require a good\namount of self-honesty from both parties\nit's not worth the attempt what do you\nthink have you gone through this process\nyourself let me know in the comments\nbelow and thank you for listening"
