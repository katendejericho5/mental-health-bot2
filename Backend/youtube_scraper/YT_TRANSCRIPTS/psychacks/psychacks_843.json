    "transcript": "it may sound strange but a relationship\nonly happens if both parties feel that\nthey're getting the better deal and this\nis possible due to the subjective\nperception of value and the principle of\nmarginal utility this lattermost\nprinciple is what seems to trip up women\nespecially successful women in the\nsexual Marketplace if I'm a rich and\nsuccessful man then the marginal utility\nof your six-figure income is negligible\nto me it's not nearly as valuable to me\nas it might be to a guy struggling\nfinancially who is not probably the type\nof guy you want to get into a\nrelationship with bringing success and\nachievement to a man who already has\nthose things in Spades is kind of like\ntrying to barter for a cup of coffee at\na cafe with coffee\nthey already have enough coffee they\ndon't want more coffee they want more\nmoney which is something that they have\nin scarcer quantities"
