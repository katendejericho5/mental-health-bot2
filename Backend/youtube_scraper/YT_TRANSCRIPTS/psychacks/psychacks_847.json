    "video_title": "Why WOMEN DON'T APOLOGIZE: understanding the nature of the problem",
    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why women\ndon't apologize I am 40 years old and I\nthink I can count on one hand\nthe number of apologies I've received\nfrom women in my life\nand that does not mean that I've only\nhad relationships with honest\nwell-behaving high integrity women over\nthe past four decades what it does mean\nis that women seem to find it very hard\nto apologize for bad behavior and this\nis too bad for two reasons in the first\nplace apologizing for something you did\nwrong is like an interpersonal slam dunk\nalmost everybody will forgive you for\nbeing wrong not everybody will forgive\nyou for being right\nbut almost everybody will forgive you\nfor being wrong especially if it means\nthat it makes the other person right and\nin the second place apologies just seem\nto matter more to men and using words to\nsolve a relationship problem is actually\na very easy and inexpensive solution all\nthings being equal\nso ladies one of the best ways to earn\nrespect and raise your estimation in\nsomeone else's mind is to admit\nwrongdoing when it's appropriate and of\ncourse to not apologize where there was\nno wrongdoing and the other person just\ndisagrees or disapproves of your actions\ncheck out my episode if you've done\nnothing wrong don't apologize for the\nflip side of this talk\ntoday I'm going to talk about why it is\nso hard for women to apologize but\nbefore I do please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's a great way to help\nspread this message so if you like what\nyou're hearing then please do the thing\nand if you're thinking about going to\ngrad school then be sure to check out my\nGRE self-study product at Stellar\ngre.com you can use the code psych for\n10 off all membership plans\nnow the reason why it is so hard for\nwomen to apologize\nis that there seems to be a difference\nin what men and women consider to be the\nproblem\nfrom a man's perspective the problem is\nsome behavior for which he believes the\nwoman to be at fault and as a\nconsequence of that behavior he is now\nangry and upset\nthe behavior is the problem and the\nemotional response is the consequence\nand in his mind the solution to this\nproblem is acknowledgment of fault and\nbehavioral change\nand I don't think that's how a lot of\nwomen see it from a woman's perspective\nthe problem is not the identified\nBehavior the problem\nis that the man is angry and upset\nand as ridiculous as that might seem to\na man there's actually some validity to\nthis perspective like in a court of law\na breach of contract by itself is\ngenerally not actionable you have to\nalso prove that some harm resulted as a\nconsequence of the breach no harm no\nfoul so it's the harm the anger and\nupset that is the foul from this\nperspective and in her mind the solution\nto this problem is changing the way he\nfeels\nif she can succeed in modifying the\nman's emotional response then on some\nlevel that would solve the problem\nand that's why you encounter the kind of\ninterpersonal strategies that you do\nwith women in relationships under these\ncircumstances rather than apologies and\naccountability you typically see a\nnumber of emotional coping strategies\nlike trying to cheer you up or making\nyour favorite meal or sending you a\nfunny meme or simply allowing enough\ntime to pass for everything to blow over\nall of these are strategies to reduce\nthe man's felt experience of anger or\nupset do you understand\nwomen also notoriously use sex in this\nmanner\nmany years ago I was out for a drink\nwith a woman I was dating and she\ndecided to take something that I said\nvery much the wrong way she quickly\nescalated and within seconds was crying\nand critical and withdrawn it was fairly\nearly in the dating process so I was\ntaken aback by how quickly this had\nescalated however as is my way I didn't\nargue with her and gave her some time\nand space to emotionally equilibrate\nlater that night rather than apologizing\nfor imputing to me something that I\ndidn't intend or owning up to the\ndisproportionate intensity of her\nemotional reaction or even acknowledging\nthe episode at all she just came into\nthe room took off all her clothes and\nkind of laid herself in front of me\nthe feeling I had was that she was\noffering sex as a kind of peace offering\nto assuage my hurt feelings rather than\napologizing for her bad behavior and in\nthat moment I unfortunately lost a lot\nof respect for this person\nbecause of what her behavior seemed to\nimply that if I could be distracted with\na bit of sex then we could all just move\nforward as if what just happened didn't\nhappen\nand I got up and slept on the couch in\nanother room that's an example of how\nwomen apologize with sex\nso men if you're expecting an apology\nfrom your woman\nI would advise you not to hold your\nbreath on the other hand ladies I would\nhighly encourage you to consider\napologizing when appropriate why because\nmen respect people who take\nresponsibility for themselves and Men\nvery rarely receive apologies from women\nso this is an easy way that costs you\nnothing to quickly distinguish yourself\nfrom the vast majority of other women in\na positive manner in the mind of a\nparticular man\nI guarantee that his estimation of you\nwill increase as a result\nwhat do you think does this square with\nyour experience of things let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
