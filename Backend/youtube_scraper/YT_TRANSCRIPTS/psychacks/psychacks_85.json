    "transcript": "if a woman does not have a life of her\nown then you will become her life and\nthat's not nearly as attractive as you\nmight think this is because a woman with\nno life of her own is going to put\nenormous pressure on the relationship to\nprovide things that it might be easier\nand more appropriate for her to get\noutside of the\nrelationship whether she's conscious of\nit or not she will expect that you\ndeliver not only what is appropriate for\na Mantic partner to provide but what is\nappropriate for a career and a friend\ngroup and a community to provide as well\nyou will need to provide her with all\nher meaning and fulfillment and\nstimulation which is a very tall order\nto say the least Arrangements like these\nare unintentionally set up to fail\nbecause no man can be nor should be all\nthings to a woman"
