    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cicax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is you can't\nhave any relationship with anyone this\ntook me so many years to understand so\nplease learn from my pain so that you\ndon't have to experience it yourself\nbasically when I was younger I used to\nbelieve that I could have any type of\nrelationship I wanted with anyone or to\nput it another way I used to believe\nthat I could have the type of\nrelationship I wanted with the person I\njust happened to be attracted to and\nthat is not true you can't have any\nrelationship with anyone you can only\nhave certain relationships with certain\npeople if you believe that you can have\na relationship with anyone you are\nlikely going to be fitting a square peg\nin a round hole you're going to believe\nthat you should be able to make it work\nif you just put in enough effort\nrelationships take work right so you're\ngoing to believe that if you only\ncommunicate better or go to therapy or\nunderstand each other or learn to\ncompromise or work even harder then you\nshould be able to have the type of\nrelationship that you want with the\nperson you want to have it with\nthis is the consequence of believing\nthat you can have any relationship with\nanyone and this belief gets people into\na lot of trouble it creates a lot of\nheartbreak a lot of wasted time a lot of\nunnecessary expense and it adds to the\nhost of human misery on this planet\nfortunately there is a way out\nhowever before I explain what this is\nplease remember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\na great way to help spread the message\nso if you like what you're hearing then\nplease do the thing also if you're\nthinking about going to grad school then\ncheck out stellar gre.com and use the\ncoupon code psych for 10 off all\nmembership plans\nso what's the alternative to this belief\na much better idea is to try to fit the\nrelationship to the person instead of\nthe other way around\nget better at understanding the type of\nrelationship you can have with the\nspecific person in question and how do\nyou do this\nby developing your discernment you have\nto be able to look at someone\nobjectively and dispassionately and this\nis no small thing if you are highly\nattracted to them because attraction\ndistorts perception this is why I say it\nis generally a very good idea to date\nfor at least six months minimum before\nyou allow yourself to become emotionally\ninvolved with someone if you allow your\nheart to get involved too early in the\nprocess you compromise your ability to\naccurately discern the other person\nwhich can lead to some very painful\nrealizations further down the road once\nthe Euphoria of the initial attraction\nwears off this means that you have to\nhave some measure of discipline with\nrespect to your emotions to be able to\nsee the other person clearly enough to\nknow what he or she is capable of and\npotentially what he or she is not\ncapable of\nthe good news is that if we're being\nhonest with ourselves crazy is actually\npretty easy to spot yes there are some\nmalicious and predatory people out there\nwho can hide it well but you can\ngenerally see most Troublesome people\ncoming from a mile away the issue is\nthat people tend to lie to themselves\nand turn to Blind Eye to the obvious red\nflags because\nthey believe they can have any\nrelationship with anyone and because\nthey have already decided to become\nemotionally involved\nand the complement to dispassionate\ndiscernment is accurate self-knowledge\nthis means knowing who you are and what\nactually works for you over and above\nwhat you want which is something else\nentirely people want things that are not\ngood for them every single day of the\nyear this is not only because people are\nfoolish and emotional but also because\nmost of what people think they want was\nnot self-generated it it was interjected\ninto their minds by their families of\norigin and their larger culture this\ndoes not constitute accurate\nself-knowledge\nwe can now put two and two together on\nthe One Hand by knowing who you are and\nwhat actually works for you and on the\nother hand by learning to see people\nwith dispassionate discernment you can\nmake much more prudent decisions with\nrespect to whether the person you're\nactually dealing with has the capacity\nto give you the type of relationship you\nmight be looking for\nthis isn't very sexy\nand this is not always fun it's way more\nfun to just get carried away and let\npassion take over but I've discovered\nthat that's an invitation to chaos and\nmisery further down the road\nas far as I can tell if you want to have\na harmonious peaceful relationship that\ncan actually go the distance there's no\nway around this you have to know\nyourself well enough to know what\nactually works for you and you have to\nhave enough critical discernment to\naccurately vet the other person\notherwise you're just rolling the dice\nor bullshitting yourself\nwhat do you think have you found this to\nbe true in your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and thank you\nfor listening"
