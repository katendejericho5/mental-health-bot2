    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nevil isn't dark\nnow I believe in the existence of evil\njust like I believe in the existence of\ngood and I don't just mean that I\nbelieve that people do bad things or are\ncapable of Good Deeds I'm talking about\nwhat we might call spiritual forces that\ncan imbue a person with their Essence so\nwe might say that there are people in\nthis world who are touched with evil and\nthat there are people in this world who\nare touched with good or Holiness this\nis my personal belief and I'm not\nproselytizing or advocating for any\nparticular religion or spiritual\ntradition this is my belief and your\nbeliefs are your business\nand within my belief one thing that I've\nlearned is that most people have a\npretty inaccurate view of what evil\nlooks like and I think this has a lot to\ndo with the movies and the fairy tales\nand the media that we have consumed from\na very young age in most cases the\nvillain is portrayed as Twisted\nugly and dark\nVoldemort is an archetypal example the\nguy is hideous to behold and shrouded in\ndark tattered robes you can't look at\nhim and not think that he's evil he is\nclearly telegraphing I'm an evil guy\nwhich actually puts him somewhat at a\ndisadvantage\nin any case I'd like you to suggest that\nthe belief that evil is dark and twisted\nvisibly\ndoes folks a disservice in a number of\ndifferent ways however before I really\nget into it please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe

you're thinking\nabout going to grad school then check\nout Stellar gre.com you can use the\ncoupon code psych for 10 off all\nmembership plans\nso how did Evil come to be associated\nwith Darkness to begin with well I think\nthis kind of occurred indirectly and by\naccident how so well the most obvious\nsymbol for goodness that has been\navailable to people on this planet\nthroughout history is the Sun\nthe Sun is bright it is constant and it\nsupports all life on this planet without\nthe sun existence as we know it would\ncease so we see how the Sun is an easy\nsymbol for the divine\nand if the Divine is symbolized by\nsomething light and bright then by\nanalogy its antithesis must be dark and\nobscure so we get the association\nbetween evil and darkness not because\ndarkness is itself evil but because\ndarkness is the opposite of the most\nobvious symbol of the good\nand this symbolic analogy has since been\nreified in the collective imagination\nonly a little critical thought is\nnecessary to understand that Darkness\nisn't actually evil in the story of\nGenesis for example on the first day of\ncreation God separated the light from\nthe darkness he named the light day and\nthe Darkness night\nand we're told that God was pleased with\nwhat he saw darkness is part of the\nDivine creation and it is good\nit's like in that Louis Armstrong song I\nsee skies of blue and clouds of white\nthe brightness of day the dark sacred\nnight and I think to myself What a\nWonderful World\nthe stars are in their tasteful arrays\nin the heavens and the moon is castoring\nit it's silvery glow over the planet the\ndark is a peaceful joyful respite\nwherein we can commune with some of the\nmore obscure aspects of the Divine\nso what does evil generally look like\nwell we have to kind of assume that few\npeople would knowingly choose to follow\nevil so it probably doesn't look\nunattractive or hideous or terrifying\nit would be very difficult for evil to\nattract followers that way\nin fact we would generally expect it to\ncome in the guise of what people want\nand to the extent that people want good\nthings we have to conclude that evil\nmust typically look almost exactly like\nthe good\nevil wears a cloak of light and that\nmeans that evil isn't dark it's bright\nwith a false light designed to mimic the\nlight of the good\nLucifer after all means light bringer\nliterally he was not dark but rather the\nbrightest shining of all the Angels the\npride of which led to his fall and we\nsee similar tropes and mythologies\nthroughout history\nall of this is to say that evil isn't\nnecessarily lurking in the shadows if\nevil is a false light then it must be\nvisible\nand in fact if you have a mind to look\nyou can see it every day you can see it\nwhen you turn on the TV you can see it\nwhen you browse social media you can see\nit in the Affairs of man throughout the\nworld it is not dark it is not hidden\nif anything it hides in plain sight and\nvery often it is attractive it is\nseductive and it is ensnaring\nevil is a lure that temps people off the\npath toward real goodness Often by\nseeming as a shortcut to the good\ntypically the only thing that looks more\nlike the good than evil is the good\nthat's how closely they appear to\nresemble each other and that's why we\nneed to have our wits about us as we\nmake our way through the world because\nthere is nothing good for us at the end\nof those other paths if you consider\nthat the most evil actions that have\nbeen committed in the history of the\nworld generally occurred in plain sight\nwith the awareness of all those involved\nyou might arrive at a different\nunderstanding of this Force\nand an accurate understanding will help\nkeep you and all of us safer\nwhat do you think have you seen this to\nbe true in your own experience let me\nknow in the comments below and thank you\nfor listening"
