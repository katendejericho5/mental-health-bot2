    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why I\ntalk about sex and money\nthe fact that I devote so many episodes\nto these two topics might be curious to\nsome of you after all isn't this psychax\nBetter Living Through psychology and\naren't I a psychologist shouldn't I be\ntalking about like mindfulness and\ndepression or something why do I talk so\nmuch about sex and money\naren't these superficial things what do\nthey really have to do with psychology\nand self-fulfillment\nclear question and I will attempt to\nanswer it in today's episode but before\nI get into it please remember to like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto help spread this message so if you\nlike what you're hearing then please do\nthe thing also if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school then you need to\ncheck out Stellar gre.com you can use\nthe coupon code psych for 10 off all\nmembership plans\nall right so there are two answers to\nthis question so be sure to watch the\nvery end because they are radically\ndifferent from each other but both kind\nof important so in the first place I\ntalk about sex and money because a lot\nof the problems that humans are subject\nto experiencing anxieties depressions\nneuroses of all kinds can actually be\nsolved\nwhen people start to get what they want\nfor instance a man who feels like he\ncannot have the kind of relationship he\nwould like with a woman is going to have\na hard time feeling confident or\nmaintaining a certain level of\nself-esteem or achieving a certain\ndegree of satisfaction in his life he's\nalso likely going to be feeling lonely\nangry and hopeless\nby the same token a woman who's always\nworried about money is going to be\nsubject to all kinds of anxieties and\nuncertainties about the future she's\ngoing to be counting every dollar which\nis kind of a mean and undignified way to\nlive to be honest and she's also likely\ngoing to feel envious depressed and\nresentful\nif you do not have enough love sex or\nmoney in your life it's really hard to\nthrive\nso helping people get access\nto Sex and Money serves to resolve a lot\nof so-called mental illnesses a lot of\nmental illness is actually due to being\nlow in a status hierarchy this has been\nwell documented in primate societies\nwhich tend to have very rigid\nhierarchical structures the lower down a\nprimate is in the social hierarchy the\nmore he tends to exhibit signs\nemblematic of depression neuroses and\nbehavioral abnormalities and when that\nsame primate is elevated in the social\nhierarchy for whatever reason a lot of\nthese signs and symptoms tend to\ndisappear\nthey're not really due to\nneurotransmitters or genetics they're\ndue to the awareness on some level that\nthey're at the bottom of the ladder\nso if folks can find a way to elevate\nthemselves within their social\nhierarchies then this by itself will do\nmuch to treat a lot of clinical\nsyndromes so that's one reason\nnow the second reason is a bit more high\nlevel and here it is\nI talk a lot about sex and money because\nI want to help people understand that at\nthe highest levels of existence\nthese things are really not that\nimportant\nmoney does not actually solve all your\nproblems having access to all the sex in\nthe world will not make you happy\nthe issue is that until you actually\nhave a lot of money and until you\nactually have a lot of access to sex and\nrelationships\nyou're gonna think I'm full of [ __ ]\nand for good reason it would sort of be\nlike listening to a billionaire say\nmoney isn't everything\nit's pretty easy to roll your eyes at\nsuch a statement like yeah yeah easy for\nyou to say buddy\nuntil you actually have a lot of money\nand a lot of access to sex and\nrelationships the vast majority of\npeople are going to continue to believe\nthat these things have the capacity to\nfulfill them on a deep level\nand the fact of the matter is the\nbillionaire is Right money isn't\neverything the player is Right sleeping\nwith thousands of women isn't fulfilling\nbut you kind of need to have a lot of\nmoney and a lot of sex to get to that\npoint\notherwise you're just gonna think it's\n[ __ ]\nso by helping people get better access\nto sex and relationships by helping\npeople earn more money and Achieve at a\nhigher level I'm actually working to\nfacilitate their disappointment with\nthese things\nand the only way to really do that is to\nhelp people get them\nso that they can realize for themselves\nthat they're not all they're cracked up\nto be until that happens they will\ncontinue to hope vainly that they are\ncapable of providing more than they can\nand ideally you want to accelerate this\ndisappointment process as quickly as\npossible those who chase money their\nentire lives only to realize that 70 how\nmuch they missed out on are actually\ntragic figures\ntheir disappointment came too late\nSo to avoid this let's get really good\nreally fast at getting access to sex and\nrelationships let's get really good\nreally fast at making money and\nachieving highly that way we can see\nthings for what they really are no more\nno less don't get me wrong I Am pro\nmoney and I love sex I have a very\nhealthy drive for these things\nbut I also don't allow myself to pretend\nthat they can offer me more than they\ncan\nand this understanding allows me to look\nfor the truly important things in life\nin more appropriate places\nwhat do you think how has disappointment\nhelped you on your path let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
