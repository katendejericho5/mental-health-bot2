    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nmake a connection with anyone\nthe ability to form a sincere genuine\nemotional connection with people opens\nup your life more than almost any other\nskill the world is full of people and if\nyou can forge an emotional connection\nwith these people you're going to have a\nmore interesting rewarding and exciting\nlife full of potential friends partners\nand lovers it's kind of the master skill\nof life and I'm going to tell you how to\ndo this however before I do so please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it\nwould definitely bring us closer\ntogether so if you like what I'm saying\nhere then please do the thing also if\nyou're thinking about going to grad\nschool then check out Stellar gre.com\nyou can use the coupon code psych for 10\noff all membership plans\nso how do you form an emotional\nconnection with anyone it basically\ninvolves empathy but most people don't\nreally understand what empathy is so\nI'll need to spend a little time here\nmost people think that empathy is sort\nof like putting yourself in another\nperson's shoes and imagining how you\nwould feel in that person's\ncircumstances\nsounds reasonable enough right but the\nissue is that that doesn't really work\nand why doesn't it work well because the\nsame stimulus can create vastly\ndifferent emotional responses in\ndifferent people hell the same stimulus\nwill create vastly different emotional\nresponses in the same person at\ndifferent times one statement will make\nsomebody Roar with laughter and another\nperson offended in Furious so imagining\nyourself in another person's\ncircumstances and considering how you\nwould feel doesn't often work to forge\nan emotional connection in fact it can\noften leave people feeling alienated and\njudged\nlet me explain about using a concrete\nexample let's say that you come across a\ncrying child and this child is upset\nbecause his favorite toy has been broken\nnow if you were to put yourself in this\nchild situation you might think\nwell\ncome on kid it's just a toy yeah it's\ndisappointing that your toy broke but in\nthe scheme of things it's really not\nthat important nobody's dead nobody's\nhurt it's not that expensive there's\nplenty of toys in the world and it might\neven be repairable I don't really see\nwhat the big deal is and I think you're\noverreacting\nas you may imagine that response is\nunlikely to lead to any kind of\nemotional connection with that child\nand if you try to explain to the child\nthat it's just a toy and that he can get\nanother one that is if you try to\naddress the problem on the level of its\nmost superficial content namely the toy\nis broken\nyou're not going to get anywhere in fact\nyou're probably going to make the\nsituation worse however this is the\nlikely response of an adult imagining\nhow he would respond under identical\ncircumstances\non the other hand instead of imagining\nyourself in the exact same circumstances\nas this individual a better idea is to\nremember a situation in your own life\nthat has created the same emotional\nreaction in you\nyou should then be able to better guess\nat what might actually be going on for\nthe other person by extrapolating\nbackward from the emotion to the\ncircumstances instead of the other way\naround\nin this case you might consider asking\nyourself\nwhat was going on in my own life the\nlast time I was crying inconsolably\noh well that was when my mother died\nand why was I so upset\nbecause I felt that I had permanently\nlost someone very precious to me\nwhat's going on here\non one level the child is crying over a\nbroken toy\nhowever on another deeper more Universal\nlevel the child is crying because he has\nlost something that he loved\nin fact given his age and experience\nthis could be the biggest loss of his\nlife the loss of his most cherished\ntreasure\nnot everyone has had the experience of\nlosing their favorite toy and trying to\nimagine what that would feel like could\nbe a cold approximation at best\nhowever almost everyone has had the\nexperience of losing something precious\nto them\nthis is the universal experience that\nmakes it possible to forge a connection\nwith even radically different people\nno matter how dissimilar the stories of\nOur Lives the underlying themes remain\nlargely the same in this case\napproaching the child with the attitude\nof I too have lost something that I\nloved is much more likely to produce an\nemotional connection than it's just a\ntoy\nthe fact of the matter is is that ideas\ntend to divide people and emotions tend\nto unite them\nwe all know what it feels like to be\nhurt\nto be relieved to be furious to be\nanxious to be consumed by desire\nhowever what hurts you might not hurt me\nand vice versa it sounds weird but the\nkey to connecting with others is to kind\nof not pay too much attention to what\nthey actually say\nthis is circumstantial detail and\nremaining on this level is what keeps\nconversation factual and uninteresting\nthe idea is to understand that what\npeople are saying is not really the end\ngoal but a door through which you can\nenter into the living pulsing emotional\nreality of the other\nif you can access that reality in\nyourself and approach the other with\nthat understanding then you're actually\nbeing empathetic\nand if you can succeed in doing that\nthen you can forge a real emotional\nconnection with pretty much anybody\nwhat do you think have you used this\nskill in your own life let me know in\nthe comments below\nthank you for listening"
