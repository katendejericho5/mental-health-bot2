    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is being\nkind isn't being nice or the two faces\nof kindness\nso kindness is actually a complicated\nconstruct it's not synonymous with\nsimply being nice being nice is not\nalways kind and being kind is not always\nbeing nice and I think the best way to\nillustrate this distinction is by\ndiscussing the two faces of kindness\nbefore I do so please remember to like\nthis episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it would really\nhelp me get this message out to more\npeople so if you like what you're\nhearing here today then please do the\nthing also if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school check out Stellar\ngre.com you can use the code psych for\n10 off all membership plans\nso kindness Has Two Faces the first face\nof kindness is the one that's more\ncommonly accepted it's basically an\nattribute of Mercy in this case kindness\nmeans not adding insult to injury or\nkicking somebody when they're down if\nsomebody's having a tough time it's kind\nnot to add difficulties\nwith punishment judgment or censure to\ntheir problems we might even try to\noffer some relief as appropriate\nand keep in mind that this applies\nequally to both other people and to\nourselves it's very important to be kind\nto ourselves so that when we fail when\nwe fall short of our goals which we\ninevitably do we don't beat ourselves up\nwe don't criticize ourselves unduly and\nwe don't pile extra punishment on top of\nthe organic pain that's one face of\nkindness to not cause harm and to ease\nsuffering as appropriate\nhowever there is another face of\nkindness that is less commonly\nappreciated\nthis face has more to do with loving\nhonesty and it does not allow other\npeople to continue to hurt themselves\nunnecessarily\nit is not kind to stand by while people\ndestroy themselves\nnow obviously this is tricky because\nunfortunately if someone has a mind to\ndo so there's little you can do to\nprevent this from happening some folks\nare so deep in delusion that they will\nreject that help however my point is\nthat you can't really think of yourself\nas kind if you don't at least try to\nintervene in unnecessary\nself-destruction\nthis has nothing to do with a moral or\nethical obligation for people to change\ntheir ways that's a should-based\njudgment on how people ought to live\ntheir lives and who are we to dictate\nthat for others what I'm talking about\nis approaching another from a place of\nlove and truth and recognizing without\njudgment or censure that they are\nhurting themselves with a certain\nBehavior\nkindness is saying that I cannot stand\nby and watch yourself destroy yourself\nwithout at least trying to bring us to\nyour attention\nreal kindness is like a coin it has two\nfaces exercising the one without the\nother is pathological\nand we see this kind of pathological\nkindness playing out every day in\ncertain cities in certain States all\nacross the country\nin San Francisco for example more people\ndied from drug overdoses in the streets\nthan from covid during the two plus\nyears of shutdowns\nin that City there is an attitude that\nit would be unkind to intervene in these\npeople's lives to provide consequences\nstructure and accountability because\nthey have already suffered enough\nthat is the first face of kindness not\nkicking seven while they're down without\nthe other this is not kind this is\nenabling\nstepping over someone's unconscious body\nto get into your apartment building does\nnot support individual autonomy or human\nrights it is degrading for all involved\nand because it's enabling it tends to\nmake the situation even worse over time\nlet's take a more concrete example let's\nsay that one of your loved ones is an\nalcoholic it's not kind to say nothing\nwhile this person drinks themselves into\nOblivion each night\nthat's enabling when a person believes\nthat saying or doing nothing is a form\nof kindness what we're really dealing\nwith is a strategy to rationalize\nconflict avoidance because unfortunately\nbringing up an alcoholic's drinking can\nprovoke a good deal of defensive\nreactiveness\nit's also not particularly kind to\nmoralize about it and to complain that\nthey shouldn't drink so much not only is\nthis judgmental it just doesn't work\nwhat kindness might look like in the\nsituation is something like hey you know\nI really care about you and I've noticed\nthat you've been drinking a lot more\nlately and you don't look so good you're\nsleeping late you're missing work and\nfrankly you've been really irritable to\nbe around I'm concerned that your\ndrinking is getting out of control and\nI'm worried that if this doesn't change\nit's going to negatively impact our\nrelationship which I value\nand it may even negatively impact your\nhealth or life\nnow the other person is going to respond\nto this as he or she sees fit that's not\nup to you but on some level\nkindness carries with it an imperative\nto at least try to extend a hand to\nfolks when they are actively\nself-destructive\nagain it is not kind to sit back and\nwatch that happen\nthat's a dangerous rationalization\nreal kindness requires loving honesty\nwhich almost always consists of\nacknowledging that people are not purely\nvictims of circumstance\nand are at least somewhat complicit in\ntheir suffering\nand this is actually empowering because\nif they are at least somewhat complicit\nin their suffering then they can\nactually do something to change their\ncircumstances which wouldn't be possible\nif they were merely only victims\nwhat do you think does kindness require\naccountability\nlet me know in the comments below and\nthank you for listening"
