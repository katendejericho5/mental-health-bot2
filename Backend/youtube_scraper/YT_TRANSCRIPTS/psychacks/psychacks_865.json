    "transcript": "you're probably familiar with the five\nstages of grief denial bargaining anger\nDespair and acceptance the one that\nalways kind of sounded weird to me was\nbargaining like what does that actually\nentail most people aren't consciously\naware that they're bargaining as they go\nthrough a heartbreak or a grieving\nperiod what I'd like to suggest to you\nis that regret is a form of bargaining\nif you're sitting in your house thinking\nwell if only I had done this or maybe I\ncan say this or do this to make the\nsituation better\nthat manifestation of regret is you\nattempting to bargain with the past to\ncreate a different outcome today so\nbargaining isn't a great word for it but\nthat's usually how that stage of grief\nmanifests itself in people's lives"
