    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is of cats\nand cheese so this is the framework I\nuse to approach the construct of human\nmotivation basically there are only two\nthings that motivate Human Action cats\nand cheese cheese is a reward associated\nwith anticipated pleasure and\nfulfillment that we approach\ncats are punishments associated with\nanticipated pain or loss that we avoid\nso if you understand the relative\nintensity and distribution of cheese in\na person's awareness and the relative\nintensity and distribution of cats in\nthe same you can pretty accurately\npredict how that person will move\nthrough life at any given moment\nnow before I unpack this framework\nfurther please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it would really help this to\nget this message out to more people so\nif you like what I'm saying here today\nthen please do the thing also if you're\nthinking of going to grad school please\ncheck out stellar gre.com and use the\ncode psych for 10 off all membership\nplans\nnow this motivational framework of mine\nhas some basis in the empirical\nliterature researchers have long studied\nmaze running behavior in rats\nunsurprisingly when cheese is placed at\nthe maze's Terminus rats tend to move\nmore quickly through the maze than they\ndo if they are simply exploring in a\nnon-directed fashion so rewards\nincentivize approach behaviors on the\nother hand when the scent of a cat a\nrat's natural predator is wafted into\nthe maze behind the rat rats tend to\nmove even more quickly through the maze\nthan they do when they are moving toward\nthe cheese so punishments incentivize\navoidance behaviors and punishments are\nmore incentivizing than rewards and this\nis because as I discussed in my episode\nthe balance of pain and pleasure pain is\noverpowered on this planet relative to\npleasure people like rats will do more\nto avoid pain than to secure pleasure\nunderstanding this basic principle will\nhelp you make more accurate predictions\nboth about your own behavior and about\nthat of other people\nso punishments are more motivating than\nrewards however to optimize motivation\nyou ideally want to utilize both the\nfastest maze running behavior is\nobserved when rats are running away from\na cat and towards some cheese\nand the more these things are clearly\ndefined and immediately present the more\npowerful these incentives become\nanother thing to keep in mind is that in\nthis maze that we call life\nthere is no escaping the cats\nand no avoiding the cheese\non some level cats and cheese are\ninherent to the maze itself they never\ndisappear entirely they just change\ntheir forms for instance some first\nlevel cats might be the inner but the\ninability to avoid the basic necessities\nof life food clothing shelter this cat\ncan be avoided in several different ways\nbegging stealing or more pro-socially\nperforming a service for another\nso the cheese here would be the money\nnecessary to procure those things\nhowever once that cat is successfully\navoided another comes to take its place\na second level cat in this domain might\nbe\nthe presence of a felt sense of\nfinancial insecurity\nand this cat could be avoided in other\ndifferent ways all of which basically\ninvolve acquiring money faster than it\nis consumed so the cheese here would be\nthe money necessary to feel free of\nemotional insecurity Etc\nI'm lonely is a low-level cat\nI'm lacking a fulfilling relationship\nwith someone who really interests me is\na high level cat\nI'm depressed is a low-level cat\nI'm not entirely self-realized he's a\nhigh level cat\nyou see the cats never really go away\nthey just sort of evolve and this is\nbecause what might have motivated you to\nrun nearer the beginning of the maze\nmight not be worth expending any effort\ntoward the further you progress through\nthe maze now if optimal motivation is\naccomplished through a combination of\ncats and cheese then a smart person will\nfind ways to explicitly and\nintentionally introduce cats and cheese\ninto his or her life and that's because\nthe person will understand that it's\nreally the presence of these things and\nespecially the presence of cats that\ninstigate constructive meaningful action\nfurthermore where we believe we are\nrelative to the incentives that we have\nidentified will significantly alter our\nsense of self and our perception of\nreality for instance if we believe that\nwe are close to the cat\nand very far from the cheese\nthen life is going to feel like hell\nvicious hopeless and cruel\non the other hand if we're close to the\ncheese and very far from the cat\nthen life is gonna feel like heaven Rich\nrewarding and abundant\nboth conditions exist in the same maze\nthe maze is not one or the other the\nmaze is the medium through which those\nconditions emerge\nand while it's true that some folks just\nseem to be born closer to the cheese\nthan to the cat and vice versa it's\nactually mostly up to us what we choose\nto consider a cat and what we choose to\nconsider some cheese\nand this is true because one person's\ncheese will not motivate any effort in\nanother I mean your own cheese five\nyears ago might not motivate any effort\nfrom you today and that can only really\nbe true if cats and cheese are not\nobjective features of reality but\nperceptual constructs that evolve as we\ndo\nand if this is true then we might\nactually have much more control over\nwhether we live in hell or whether we\nlive in heaven then we may at first\nanticipate\nwhat do you think how do you introduce\ncats into your own life let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
