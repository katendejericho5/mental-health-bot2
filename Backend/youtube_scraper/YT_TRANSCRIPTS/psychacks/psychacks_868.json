    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why men\ncare about a woman's sexual history\nmost men on some level already\nunderstand the answer to this question\nso this episode is specifically designed\nto help the women out there women\nI imagine that the emphasis that men can\nput on your sexual history can feel\nsomewhat baffling especially if we're\ntalking about experiences that occurred\nbefore the man in your life even knew\nyou you might think all that is in the\npast that was then and this is now and\nI'm here with you now so really what's\nthe issue well I'm here to explain what\nthe issue is\nbut before I do so please remember to\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto help spread this message so if you\nlike what you're hearing then please do\nthe thing also if you're thinking about\ngoing to grad school then check out\nstellar gre.com and use the coupon code\npsych for 10 off all membership plans\nso why are men so concerned about what\nyou did in the past sexually with other\nmen the answer is actually complex and\nmultifaceted there are two general\ncomponents here's how we can begin to\napproach an understanding ladies\nhave you ever had the experience and I\nbet you have\nof buying an expensive piece of clothing\nonly to realize a week or two later that\na discount code existed that could have\ngotten you 50 off the same item\nwhen you learn about the existence of\nthat code\nhow do you feel\nnot very good right you may even have\ncomplained and tried to get the company\nto retroactively honor the code after\nthe purchase I've seen many women do\nthem\nand why do you do that because learning\nabout the discount code actually changes\nyour perception of the item that you\nbought\nwhereas two weeks ago you were more or\nless happy to pay full price for that\npiece of clothing\nonce you realize that you paid 100\npercent more than you needed to\nyou can't look at the same item the same\nway again it's not nearly as attractive\nand desirable as it once was why because\nit turns out you didn't actually\nunderpay for something valuable you\noverpaid for something cheap\nand that is not a good feeling\nso what does this have to do with sexual\nhistory and relationships well a number\nof things first of all you have to\nunderstand that broadly speaking there\nis a sort of arms race between men and\nwomen in the sexual Marketplace\nin a highly simplified version it breaks\ndown like this men are trying to get as\nmuch sex as possible from women for the\nleast amount of time energy and money\nand women are trying to get as much time\nenergy and money from Men for the least\namount of sex\nthis is obviously an oversimplification\nbut there must be at least some truth to\nit because we typically don't see the\nroles reversed\nso when a man is actually in a\nrelationship with you in that he's\ntaking you out on dates and listening to\nyour problems and meeting your family\nand taking you on trips and supporting\nyou emotionally in short when he is\nheavily investing time energy and money\ninto you\nand then he learns that you a guy\nthat you met at a bar an hour ago and\nwho ghosted you the next day\nhe's gonna feel like you did when you\nfound out about those discount codes\nthat is he's gonna feel like a total\nschmuck for overpaying for something\nthat you are obviously willing to sell\nfor a fraction of the price\nand I guarantee that will change the way\nhe perceives you forever\nso that's one part of the answer the\nsecond part of the answer of why men\ncare about a woman's sexual history is\neven more pragmatic in general to\ndetermine how people actually feel feel\nit's far more accurate and reliable to\nexamine what people do\nover and above what people say\nthe fact of the matter is that people\ncan move their lips and say anything\nthey can say things like I love you or\nyou're the best I've ever had or I can't\nstop thinking about you\npeople can say whatever they want\nand because of that there's always the\npossibility of Doubt as to whether or\nnot the words actually reflect their\nfelt experience and objective reality\nNow ladies it's also true that you will\ndo more in the bedroom with men you are\nmore attracted to\nwith men you like more\nwhen your attraction is high you will\nmake yourself more sexually available in\nevery sense of those words and you will\nwillingly break the rules that you\nrigidly enforce for others\nso if you put two and two together you\ncan see that learning about a woman's\nsexual history is a way for men to kind\nof confirm a woman's words with her\nactions and to determine how attracted\nto a woman how attractive a woman\nactually is to them\nwhy\nbecause if a man finds out that you did\nother things sooner or more frequently\nthan you did or do with him\nthe reasonable conclusion that he is\ngoing to draw is that you are not as\nattracted to him as you have been to\nother men in your past\nwith whom you were willing and\nenthusiastic about doing those things\nand this is also going to make him feel\nlike a schmuck because it's going to\nmake him feel like you are settling for\nhim\nthat's the second part and if you\ncombine those two parts the result is a\nman who now feels that he's paying twice\nas much for half as much which is not a\ngreat place to be\nhow does this play out in my own\npersonal life well if I learn for\nwhatever reason\nthat a woman is not willing to be more\nsexually open available and freaky with\nme then I know she's been with the guy\nthat she has been most attracted to in\nthe past\nthen I just concluded the relationship\nis not worth my time\nthis is not because I think I'm entitled\nto those things I appreciate that I'm\nnot everyone's cup of tea and some women\nwill find me more attractive than others\nthat is perfectly fine\nI conclude that the relationship is not\nworth my time because I only want to be\nin a relationship with women who feel\nlike I'm the best she's ever had\nwith women who are extremely attracted\nto me\nwith women who are enthusiastic and\nexcited about being there\nthat's the experience I'm looking for\nand the best way for her to demonstrate\nthat feeling is by doing things with me\nthat she hasn't done with other men\neverything else is just lip service\nwhat do you think did my explanation\nmake sense\nplease let me know in the comments below\nand thank you for listening"
