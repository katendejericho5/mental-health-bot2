    "transcript": "so one of the absolute worst questions\nyou can ask yourself in the morning is\nwhat do I feel like doing today and the\nreason why this is a terrible question\nis because if you're like most people\nwhat you feel like doing will cause you\nto gravitate towards activities that are\ncomfortable convenient and pleasurable\nand these activities are not generally\nconducive to personal growth long-term\nsatisfaction or meaning making which are\nthe real like high level uh\nself-realized stuff of life so my\nsuggestion is to plan at least tomorrow\ntoday you should know what you have on\nthe docket when you wake up in the\nmorning I like doing this because it's\nalmost like I have a personal manager or\nlike a tour guide who every morning\nhands me the itinerary and tells me you\ndon't really have to make any decisions\nright now you just have to show up in\nthis curated day that we've planned for\nyou and we know you very well because of\ncourse it was you that made the\nitinerary so we know that you're going\nto absolutely love what we have in store\nfor you today try it out"
