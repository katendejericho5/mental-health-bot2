    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\ndeal with gossip\nso to start off this episode I need to\nconfess that I learned these tips like\nmany others on this channel the hard way\nmany years ago I was a member of a\ncommunity in which I became the target\nof malicious gossip in the beginning it\nwas hard to know what was going on\nsomething felt off but I couldn't put my\nfinger on what that might be and it\nwasn't until several months went by that\none of my friends finally pulled me\naside and said hey Orion people are\nsaying XYZ about you and I thought you\nshould know\nnow this belief was not true and I\nimmediately understood who was spreading\nit and why and in that moment other\ninexplicable events over the past\nseveral months finally made sense\nthat said as you may appreciate at the\nmoment I was angry to learn that this\nwas happening and hurt that other\nmembers of my community might actually\nbelieve this about me\nespecially because I prided myself on my\nreputation both generally and within\nthis particular community\nso I came up with a plan on how to\naddress the issue\nnow before I tell you what I did and\nwhat the results of my efforts were\nplease remember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nsomething positive you can do behind my\nback so do the thing\nall right so what did I do about the\ngossip\nI decided that I would approach members\nof the community\nsit down with them individually and\nattempt to clear my name with evidence\nand transparency my belief was that if I\ndealt with people face to face and\nbrought the issue into the light of day\nthat we could get to the bottom of\nthings and they would see the truth of\nthe matter\nI thought I could restore my good name\nin this way\nand I ended up talking to a few dozen\npeople over the next several weeks about\nthis topic and I discovered some really\nsurprising things these are the three\ntips about dealing with gossip that I\nlearned the hard way and that I hope to\nimpart to you today\nthe first is to accept that people don't\ncare about the truth\nand this was the case on both sides both\nthe people who liked me didn't care\nabout the truth and the people who\ndidn't particularly like me didn't care\nabout the truth when I approached some\nof my friends about this issue they\nwould generally stop me pretty early on\nand say something like hey don't worry\nabout it Orion I knew that wasn't true\nas soon as I heard it I believe you and\nyou've done nothing to prove to me and\nthis of course was reassuring however by\nthe same token the folks who didn't\nparticularly like me didn't care about\nthe truth either even when I was able to\nprevent and present evidence that\ncompletely refuted the gossip they would\nsay something like I don't know Ryan\nyeah that's not what I heard and why\nwould somebody lie about something like\nthis\nthe fact is that both groups of people\nhad already decided how they felt about\nme before the rumors were spread\nAll the gossip did was push people in\nthe direction they were already headed\nit made my friends more friendly and my\nenemies more antagonistic\nand in this way the ordeal was actually\nvery useful for me because it helped me\nto clarify who my friends really were\nsome people I thought were my friends\nwere actually in this second group they\nwould smile at me but they were wearing\na mask and seeing past this veneer was a\nvery painful experience but ultimately a\nbeneficial one\nso that's the first thing it's a bitter\npill to swallow but it will help you\npass through that moment if you accept\nthat people don't care about the truth\nand this is because there's this\nknee-jerk reaction when you learn that\nsomeone is spreading lies about you to\ngo out and like prove your innocence\nand nobody cares nobody cares\nthe second tip which is another bitter\npill to swallow is to accept that your\nreputation\nis not in your control\ntrue I can do things or not do things\nthat may influence how other people\nthink of me but my reputation ultimately\nexists as an idea in other people's\nminds and what people think of me in the\nprivacy of their own minds is ultimately\nbeyond my domain of control\non some level through this experience I\ncame to understand that other people's\nopinion of me is actually none of my\nbusiness\nand because it's none of my business and\nbecause it's outside of my control I can\nadopt an attitude of indifference toward\nit and this cut both ways indifference\nwith respect to fame and popularity like\npositive reputation and indifference\nwith respect to gossip and ignominy like\nnegative reputation\nboth are Phantoms without substance that\nexist solely in the minds of other\npeople\nand finally the third tip for dealing\nwith gossip is to understand that other\npeople have already moved on\nit's hard to find yourself in the rumor\nmill it's a painful place to be when\nyou're the target of malicious gossip\nit's sometimes all you can think about\nbut that's not true of the people you're\nconcerned about most likely they haven't\neven given it a second thought and\nthat's because you're actually just a\nsupported player in the story of their\nown lives their minds are full of\nthemselves\nand if other people have already moved\non\nwhy not join them\nso that's what I got for you today I\nhope you found these tips useful do you\nhave any of your own if so let me know\nin the comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
