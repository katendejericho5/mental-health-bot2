    "transcript": "as a man it can actually be fairly\ndifficult to discern whether you\nactually like a woman or you are simply\nsexually attracted to her and obviously\nit's important to make that distinction\nnow there are many ways to do this and\nit might sound a little crass but in my\nopinion one of the best ways to\ndiscriminate between those two options\nis to have sex with the woman and notice\nhow you feel immediately afterwards if\nyou notice that you are full of regret\nyou're questioning what you're doing\nhere and you can't wait for her to leave\ncongratulations you were horny and you\nwere sexually attracted to this woman\ndoesn't necessarily mean that you can't\nfind something about her to like or that\nyou shouldn't continue to pursue that\nrelationship but you don't yet actually\nlike the person on the other hand if you\nfinish and you enjoy her company and you\nlike appreciate her presence in that\nparticular moment there might be\nsomething about this person\nthat you are attracted to"
