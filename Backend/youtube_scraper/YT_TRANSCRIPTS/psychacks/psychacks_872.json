    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is fully\nhalf full\nso I coined this phrase to describe the\npractice of contentment contentment is\nthe heart of Happiness most people are\ntrying to be happy if you want to be\nhappy you must cultivate the practice of\ncontentment you can't have the one\nwithout the other\nnow contentment isn't easy but it's\nactually very simple\nand thank God for that it's because of\nthis Simplicity that contentment is\nactually available to all of us\nregardless of our circumstances it would\nbe quite a tragedy quite an oversight in\nthe millions of years of human evolution\nif our contentment were dependent on\nexternal circumstances given how unfair\nthe distribution of resources across the\nface of the planet is\nso fortunately that's not the case\ncontentment is available to all of us\nindependent and irrespective of these\ncircumstances\nnow before I explain what the practice\nof contentment entails please be sure to\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's just as\nsimple as contentment so do the thing\nall right so contentment is basically\nthe practice of turning toward the\npresent moment and accepting it as\nenough accepting it as sufficient\nthat's it that's the practice of\ncontentment now this definition is tough\nto swallow for a lot of people and these\nfolks say to me but Orion my present\nmoment is not enough that's the problem\nI'm broke I'm lonely I'm miserable and\nI'm afraid that if I were to take your\nadvice and accept my present moment as\nenough I would become complacent and\nunwilling to do the work to make my\npresent moment better\nokay fair enough so how do we handle\nthis objection personally I believe that\ncontentment is not antithetical to\nhaving goals if you're dissatisfied with\nbeing broke you have a goal you want to\nmake money if you're dissatisfied with\nbeing lonely you have a goal you want a\nrelationship if you're dissatisfied with\nbeing miserable you have a goal you want\nto be\nfilled these are great goals to have\nbut here's the thing having a goal and\nworking towards it is actually\nindependent of accepting where you are\nin the process of attaining that goal\nwhich can be sufficient to the present\nmoment\nlet's make this concrete with a specific\nexample\nthis glass here\nhas some water in it\nThe Optimist would say that it's half\nfull and the pessimist would say that\nit's half empty so\nwho is correct well kind of neither one\nof them is correct because both of them\nare comparing this reality that is\nactually present in front of them the\nglass that has got some water in it to\nan abstraction that doesn't actually\nexist an abstraction that only exists as\nan idea in their own minds\nThe Optimist is comparing this reality\nto An Empty Glass which isn't actually\nthere\nthis basis of comparison is inherent in\nthe language half full\nand this comparison Alters his\nperception of reality\non the other hand the pessimist is\ncomparing this reality to a full glass\nwhich also isn't actually there and the\nbasis of this comparison is also\ninherent in his language half empty\nand this comparison Alters his\nperception of reality neither is\nactually seeing reality clearly but the\nDistortion is so close to perception\nthat most people don't notice it\nthe practice of contentment is to kind\nof see the glass\nas fully half full\nit is full and complete in its halfness\nand incompleteness\na perfect description as even the\nconcept of halfness refers to wholeness\nbut hopefully you get the idea\nand even if you add more water or take\nsome water away the glass is still fully\nand completely itself at every step of\nthe process it's always whole even as it\nincreases its volume\nit's only not whole in comparison to an\nabstraction that exists in your own mind\nthe more that we can see things as they\nare not as they could be or should be or\nmight be the more that we see that the\npresent moment is actually enough\nit's full\nthat's the incredible thing about\nreality you can't add to it\nand you can't take anything from it it\nis inviolably whole at every moment\nthroughout eternity\nand the more we perceive reality the\nmore we can also participate in that\nwholeness which facilitates the practice\nof contentment which itself is one of\nthe primary components of human\nhappiness\nhopefully that makes sense what do you\nthink how do you practice contentment\nlet me know in the comments below and\nthank you for listening"
