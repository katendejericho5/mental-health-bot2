    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is suncax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is get a\nside Hustle\nnew year new you and one of the best\nthings that you can do this year for\nyourself is to get yourself a side\nHustle\nif you don't you're going to be eating\nCrumbs from your own table what does\nthis mean this means that the vast\nmajority of people give the best hours\nof most of the days of the best years of\ntheir lives to their jobs in exchange\nfor a salary which if you think about it\nis pretty poor recompense for a life\nand then content themselves with the\ncrumbs that are left over\nand unfortunately because they spend the\nbest hours of most of the days of the\nbest years of their lives at their jobs\nwhen they do have time for themselves\nthey're generally so exhausted that they\ndon't really have the energy or the\nfocus for any high quality activities\nand so what do they do well for most\nfolks that means sitting in front of a\nscreen\nand the fact of the matter is that\nnobody at the end of their life is going\nto regret not spending more time in\nfront of the screen\nso you need to find a way out of this\nproblem and before I describe this exit\nstrategy please like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\na direct way for you to support the idea\nof a side Hustle\nso do the thing\nas I was saying you need to find a way\nout of this problem it's one of the most\nimportant things that you can do and it\nwill make a significant difference in\nthe overall quality of your life now if\nyou're like most people watching this\nyou are not independently wealthy and\nyou are not an entrepreneur\nso you probably have a steady job\nand the first step to getting yourself\nout from underneath that job is to find\na way to supplement that income with a\nside Hustle there are two basic ways to\ndo this you can either sell a product or\nyou can sell a service and of these two\nit is far easier to begin by selling a\nservice because all you really need is\nyourself\nthis takes a weekend to set up\nfirst you need to consider what service\nyou're willing and able to provide in\nyour free time you don't need to be\nworld class in order to get started\nwhich is great because you won't be you\njust need to be better at the service\nthan whoever might hire you and\nobviously the better you are the wider\nthe swath of humanity that will include\nbut I'm here to tell you that no matter\nwho you are you're better than some\ncross-section of humanity at something\nand that can be the basis of your side\nhustle service\nnext you need to develop a presence\nonline\naccomplished in a weekend for around 250\ndollars you can buy an annual membership\non a web hosting site and using their\ntemplates create a basic home page who\nyou are and what you do\nyou can then create a free profile for\nyour business on Yelp and Google and\nlist your go your your business your\nwebsite that is and list your website on\nGoogle search console so that it's\ngoogleable this is important until you\nregister your website with Google search\nconsole your website will be invisible\nto the Google search algorithm however\nthis only takes a few minutes and it's\ncompletely free\nYelp is also a fantastic resource\nbecause it's a way to hack the Google\nalgorithm search for any service near me\non Google and I can guarantee that you\nwill see a Yelp search for that query on\nthe first page of results and if you can\nget on the first page of that Yelp\nsearch which often only takes a dozen\nreviews you can functionally get on the\nfirst page of Google without spending a\ndime\nI got this advice 10 years ago and I've\nmade a great deal of money over that\ntime from just this one tip alone\nso establish establishing a side hustle\nis actually not that hard the startup\ncosts are very low in terms of time and\nmoney of course putting a line in the\nwater is easy it's catching the fish\nthat is difficult and that first fish is\nthe most difficult to catch now in the\nbeginning getting your side hustle going\nmight require you to work one and a half\nto two jobs for a while you'll need to\nwork your steady gig and then spend some\ntime in the evenings on your side hustle\nthis obviously will make your days\nlonger and you'll have to find other\nways to take care of yourself so that\nyou don't burn out this is important as\nthe process will likely take one to two\nyears to really get going but if it's\ngoing to take that long you might as\nwell get started\nand once this gets going you can begin\nto transition away from working for\nothers from eating Crumbs from your own\ntable\nand toward living life on your own terms\nand that is a really amazing feeling\na life-changing feeling I've done this a\nnumber of times at this stage in my life\nI've built a number of businesses up to\na six-figure annual income\nso I have some experience with what I'm\ntalking about and if I can do it then\nthere's no reason that you can't do it\ntoo\nnow in the next episode which I'm\nreleasing concurrently with this one I'm\ngoing to go into some detail\non one of my side hustles so if you're\ninterested please keep watching until\nthen what are your business plans for\n2023 is this the year you finally\nlaunched that business\nlet me know in the comments below and\nthank you for listening"
