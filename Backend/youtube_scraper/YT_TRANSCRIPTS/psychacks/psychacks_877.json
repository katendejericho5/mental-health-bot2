    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is there are\nonly two goals the importance of goals\ncannot be overstated if we do nothing\nthings get worse this is the law of\nentropy disorder increases inside of a\nclosed system this law is baked into the\nfabric of reality it is not a product of\nour culture or our social systems as\nShakespeare wrote tis an unweed Garden\nthat grows to scorn things Rank and\ngross in nature possess it merely so we\nneed goals because if we do nothing life\nfalls apart some effort is required\nsimply to maintain the status quo and to\ncounteract Decay disorder and\ndissolution and that effort can be\ndirected in a myriad number of ways\nhowever I'm here to tell you today that\nthere are really only two goals and\nbefore I get into this framework please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to Channel it takes less than\na second costs you nothing and it's a\nway that you can help Stave off the\nentropy inside this closed system so do\nthe thing\nnow as I said there are really only two\ngoals here they are the first is that\nyou can start doing something that\nyou're not doing and the second is that\nyou can stop doing something that you\nare doing\nthat's it all goals can be subsumed into\none of just these two categories now\njust because this is a simple framework\ndoesn't mean that there's no substance\nhere\nmost importantly this framework\nclarifies that all goals regardless of\nwhether they seem related to external\nphenomena are really self-directed\naction\nall goals are properly Behavioral a\nhappy marriage\nisn't really a goal changing how you\nrespond to your partner so that you\nfight less is\na bank account with 10 million dollars\nin it isn't really a goal building a\nside hustle that earns a significant\npassive income is and this is helpful\nbecause to the extent that you localize\nthe goal in your own behavior you\nsimultaneously begin to develop a plan\nof action for attaining that goal and\nthis will make it more likely that you\nget what you want faster\nand if you want to see the fastest\nImprovement it's best to prioritize the\nlatter goal that is to stop doing\nsomething that you are currently doing\nit's better to stop doing the one or two\nthings that are hampering or obstructing\nyour progress and this is because in\nthis world Pleasure and Pain creation\nand destruction\nare not really equal\none or two bad actions can counteract\ntens of good ones it's not a one-to-one\nequivalence generally bad things are\nmore bad than good things are good for\nwhatever reason reality is such that bad\nthings are overpowered\nso rather than screw up all this\ndiscipline and intentionality and effort\nto do things that you're not currently\ndoing in order to get more good in your\nlife\nFirst Direct that discipline and\nintentionality and effort toward things\nthat you are currently doing in order to\nget less bad in your life\nthis is because even if you succeeded in\nthe first attempt which would be hard to\ndo anyway your progress might be\ncounteracted by the Decay that you've\nleft unaddressed and this will corrode\nyour discipline and intentionality over\ntime with respect to the good actions\nbecause you won't really be seeing a lot\nof improvement or progress for your\nefforts and it's very difficult to\nmaintain consistency which is a\nrequisite of progress under these\ncircumstances\nfinally if goals are behavioral that is\nif there are things you either do or\ndon't do\nthen you can really only have one goal\nat a time\nbecause you can really only do one thing\nat a time\nthis is really important sometimes folks\nfall into this kind of mania for goal\nsetting often around New Year's and they\ntry to work on too many things at once\nand this generally leads to sub-optimal\noutcomes and self-recrimination why do\nthat to yourself\npick one thing and work on it until it\nkind of becomes routinely integrated\ninto your lifestyle it could take\nseveral months but that's okay once it's\nthere it's stable and you can turn your\nattention to the next goal\na successful life is like spinning\nplates you have to give a plate enough\nattention and energy for it to kind of\nhum along for a while while you attend\nto something else otherwise it'll wobble\nand crash as soon as you take your eyes\noff it hopefully this all makes sense to\nyou what do you think do you have any\ntips for goal setting let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
