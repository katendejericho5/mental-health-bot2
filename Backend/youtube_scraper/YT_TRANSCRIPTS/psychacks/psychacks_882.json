    "transcript": "the stoic philosophers believe that\nwithin our domain of control we have the\ncapacity to Ascent to agree and to\ndissent to disagree but they didn't\nbelieve that we always have to use those\ncapacities there's a third option which\nis neither a hunting nor dissenting\nwhich basically means that I don't have\nan opinion one way or the other and the\nstoics believe that most Things fall\ninto this category that we should use\nascent and descent very consciously and\nintentionally why is that because to\nactually create a correct opinion about\nsomething requires not only the\nintegration of your own experience but\nanalysis of objective data and evidence\nit's a time consuming process it\nrequires critical thought it's actually\nvery difficult to do and the stoics\ncorrectly understood that most people\nare not going to take the time to do\nthat and that actually creates a lot of\nproblems for the individual and also in\nsociety you don't have to have an\nopinion"
