    "transcript": "as we're approaching Christmas I thought\nI'd do a short in the spirit of that\nholiday\nwho is the Immaculate Conception most\npeople out there think the Immaculate\nConception was Jesus because they\nbelieved that Jesus was conceived\nimmaculately like there was no actual\nsexual intercourse between the Virgin\nMary and Joseph hence an Immaculate\nConception but that's not actually true\naccording to Christian doctrine the\nImmaculate Conception does not refer to\nJesus it refers to Mary\nMary is the Immaculate Conception\nbecause she was born without original\nsin according to Catholic Doctrine which\nmeans that God intervened in the\nstaining of her spirit such that she\ncould be a pure vessel for the baby\nJesus and I think this has an important\nspiritual lesson for us in the sense of\nhigher Consciousness is born from a\nstate of purity"
