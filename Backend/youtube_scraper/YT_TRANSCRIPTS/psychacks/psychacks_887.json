    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is how to\nimprove your self-esteem\nso I've already done a similar episode\non how to improve your self-confidence\nand now I'm turning my attention to\nself-esteem self-confidence and\nself-esteem are related but they're\nactually separate issues\nself-confidence is related to efficacy\nit's the belief that all other things\nbeing equal\nyou can do something that you will be\nsuccessful in the attempt on the other\nhand self-esteem is more like all other\nthings being equal I feel good about who\nI am as a person as a human being\nunfortunately there are a lot of folks\nout there who struggle with self-esteem\nissues\nthey may even be very successful and\nself-confident but they have low\nself-esteem nonetheless these folks\ndon't think very highly of themselves\nand don't really feel good inside of\ntheir own skin fortunately there is a\nsimple and effective way to improve your\nself-esteem but before I get into what\nthat is please remember to like this\nepisode And subscribe to this channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's definitely an estimable\naction so do the thing\nso improving your self-esteem isn't that\ncomplicated the formula has two parts\nfirst you need to do difficult or\nsteamable things and that kind of makes\nsense it's pretty hard to feel like\nyou're a good person if you're not doing\nanything that you yourself would\nconsider difficult or esteemable so pick\na goal and go after it do something hard\ndo something that you can be proud of\nhaving done\npeople don't get genuine self-esteem\nfrom sitting on the couch and scrolling\non social media they need to do\ndifficult or steamable things and\nfrankly you probably already knew this\nbut here's the thing the first part is\nnot enough you need to also do the\nsecond part and this is the part that's\nreally neglected in today's day and age\nin order to develop self-esteem not only\ndo you have to do difficult and\nesteemable things\nbut you have to do difficult and\nesteemable things\nand not tell anyone about them\nthat's the hard part in the age of\nsocial media so why is this important\nthis is important because if you do\nsomething difficult or esteemable and\nthen you share it with others then you\nsubstitute self-validation for external\nvalidation in fact you rob yourself of\nthe opportunity for self-validation\nwhich is the basis of self-esteem you\nexchange your own internal satisfaction\nfor praise views and likes and when you\ndo that you're basically training your\nmind to understand that the reward for\ndifficult or stingable action is the\npraise or validation of others\nand the longer you do that the more you\nwill rely on external validation for\nyour own self-regulation and the more\nyou will need to prop up your own\nself-esteem with the praise of others\ntaken to it is Extreme people are\nsubject to becoming like validation\njunkies and this can be as addictive as\nany substance Addiction in fact we would\ncall it a process addiction like\ngambling and it can lead to some very\ndark places\nso the idea here is to do difficult or\nesteemable things and not tell anyone\nabout them\nthis will give you the opportunity to\nvalidate and esteem yourself which is\nhow you get self\nesteem\nand how do you do that well you kind of\nhave to talk to yourself in a supportive\nand encouraging way like\nI'm proud of what I did today or I was\nscared but I did it anyway or I wanted\nto quit but I kept going good job Orion\nI know it sounds kind of cheesy but\nthat's the kind of self-validation that\nfacilitates the cultivation of healthy\nself-esteem\nthen over time you'll find that you\nwon't need as much external validation\nin fact you'll eventually become\nindifferent to both praise and sexual\nand this is an a supremely good thing\nwhy because if you're still emotionally\ninfluenced by whether people agree or\ndisagree with you or like or don't like\nyou or praise or censure you then you're\nstill more or less a Slave\nand not just a slave but a slave with a\nmillion Masters\nby learning to validate ourselves\nsufficiently we can experience a kind of\nemotional manumission whereby we can\nemancipate ourselves from the slavery of\nexternal validation\nwhat do you think let me know your\nthoughts in the comments below and thank\nyou for listening"
