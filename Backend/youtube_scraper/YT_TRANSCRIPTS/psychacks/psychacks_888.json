    "transcript": "let's say that you have a crush on\nsomebody at school somebody at work and\nyou want to know if they might secretly\nlike you back well there's a very simple\nlow-tech test that you can do to figure\nthat out basically research has shown\nthat when people are in a group setting\nand a joke is told people will look\ntowards the person in the group that\nthey feel most positively toward so\nbasically all you have to do is get\nyourself in that situation where you're\nin a group setting with your crush and\nkind of wait for that to happen you have\nto be a little surreptitious about your\nglance because of course you're going to\nbe looking over there because that's the\nperson that you're most positively\nregarding in that group but it does work\nbi-directionally and so that's something\nthat you can kind of use as a little\nsleuthy tip as to somebody's true\nfeelings"
