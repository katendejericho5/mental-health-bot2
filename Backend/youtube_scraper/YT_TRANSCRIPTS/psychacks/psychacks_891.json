    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is if it's\nworth doing\nif you grew up in the United States you\nprobably know the rest of this saying\nthat is if something's worth doing\nit's worth doing well\nand absolutely there is some truth to\nthat it's generally a positive force to\nstrive after Perfection and there are\ncertain things that absolutely shouldn't\neven be attempted if you're not willing\nto do them with a high degree of\ncompetence brain surgery\nand deep sea exploration come to mind\nthat's because even a small error in\neach of these Endeavors could frustrate\nthe entire project\nthat said I've come to adopt a different\nview of this adage as I've grown older\nand before I tell you what that is\nplease be sure to like this episode And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can demonstrate your own\ncommitment to Excellence so do the thing\nas I was saying nowadays I see things a\nlittle differently that is I now believe\nthat if something is worth doing it's\nworth doing poorly\nlet me try to make an argument in\ndefense of this reframe sometimes people\nare prevented from taking positive or\nconstructive action because of their own\nperfectionistic tendencies\nand these inactions and hesitations over\ntime can have a substantially\ndeleterious impact on people's lives and\nwell-being let's take a concrete example\nI think we can all agree that exercising\nand being physically fit is something\nworth doing well if that's true then\nit's worth doing badly that is it's\nworth doing even if you're not going to\nget shredded and end up with six-pack\nabs it's worth doing even if you're not\ngoing to break any records for Speed or\nstrength or distance and even exercising\nonce a week which isn't all that good is\nprobably better than not exercising at\nall\nif something is worth doing it's worth\ndoing poorly because these poor attempts\ncan accumulate over time and create\nsignificant progress\nor at least delay significant decay a\nlot of the difficulties that people\nencounter in their lives are directly\nattributable to their tendency to\nDiscount small improvements\none push-up does not make you strong\ndieting for one week does not make you\nsick\nworking for one month doesn't make you\nrich\nbecause there is no immediate positive\nreinforcement for their efforts people\ntend to minimize and discount these\nconstructive actions and I think that's\nultimately to their detriment by the\nsame token because there is no immediate\nnegative punishment for their inaction\npeople tend to minimize and discount\ntheir non-constructive evasions\nand what happens put two and two\ntogether and the bad tends to accumulate\nwhile the good goes neglected\nthis is why I believe that if something\nis worth doing do it sloppily do it\ninfrequently do it imperfectly do it\npoorly\nbut do it anyway\nwhy because it's worth doing\nin many cases a little of a good thing\nis preferable To None of a better\nand I believe this principle holds true\nat all levels of analysis from\nindividual health\nall the way to the fate of humanity\nwhat do you think let me know your\ncomments in uh the section below and\nthank you for listening"
