    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwomen are making Society polygamous now\nthis is obviously a very provocative\ntitle but that doesn't necessarily mean\nthat it isn't true and I hope to back it\nup with some evidence and arguments in\nthis episode\nI will say at the outset that I don't\nthink this movement is intentional that\nis I don't think that women are\nconsciously attempting to accomplish\nthis purpose this is an epiphenomenon\nthat emerges out of the data on Mass\nkind of like how a wave emerges out of\nthe movements of individual particles\nnone of which are particularly wave-like\nnone of the molecules has any awareness\nthat it is contributing to the wave but\nthe wave arises out of the molecules\nnonetheless this is the mystery\nsurrounding individuals and populations\nthe two are obviously connected but it's\nimpossible to see how unless you take a\nwide enough Vantage and of course before\nI lay out my arguments please be sure to\nlike this episode And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's also a way\nfor you to be a part of something much\nlarger than yourself so do the thing\nnow to understand why this is happening\nwhy women are making Society polygamous\nyou have to first understand that women\ntoday are absolutely crushing it\nwell there was a gender gap that clearly\nfavored men 50 years ago we now have a\ngender gap that clearly favors women and\nin many domains the size of this gender\ngap is larger than the size of the\ngender gap that we had a half century\nago probably for the first time in human\nhistory in most western societies\nchildless women under 30 are earning\nmore than childless men under 30. women\nare graduating from high school from\nCollege from gross from postgraduate\ninstitutions at a significantly higher\nrate than men in fact at a nearly two to\none ratio the\nvery well so hooray women\nthat said all this success does come\nwith an unintended consequence with\nrespect to the dating market and before\nthe women complain well who cares about\ndating\nlet me just say that you should care\nabout dating Because unless you want to\ngo back to your father choosing your\nhusband for you this is pretty much the\nonly Pathway to long-term relationships\nmarriage and children which are things I\noften hear women caring about so\nproblems with dating will have important\nDownstream consequences\nso what is the unintended consequence in\norder to understand it you first have to\nappreciate that women tend to date\nhypergamously\nfor those of you have never heard this\nterm before hypergamy is the tendency to\ndate across and up status hierarchies to\nput it simply women want a man who is at\nleast as good as her if not better\nand better of course is how women choose\nto Define it because it's for the cat to\ndecide which milk is good\nhowever with respect to some very\nobvious metrics women tend to marry men\nwho are older taller stronger higher\nstatus and higher earning\nand here's the rub\nif women are outperforming most men and\nwomen continue to date hypergamously\nthen voila\nyou have an increasingly shrinking pool\nof men that the majority of women would\neven consider as candidates for dating\nand mating\nand that's bad for women because fewer\neligible men significantly increases the\nintra-sex competition for a dwindling\npool of potential mates and it's also\nbad for most men because most men are\njust flat out being disqualified from\nthe sexual Marketplace\non the other hand if you are a top 10\npercent man a top five percent man\nwow is it a time to be alive and why is\nthat because all of these beautiful high\nachieving intelligent successful women\nare competing for you one of a smaller\nand smaller subset of men\nand the men at the top of these status\nhierarchies are just having a lot of sex\nwith a lot of different women and this\nphenomenon is accelerating at a\nfantastic rate\nin the last 10 years the number of\nsexual partners that the average man has\nhad has remained the same however over\nthat time according to the General\nSocial Survey the number of men under 30\nwho had no sex in the past 10 years in\nthe past year has tripled from 10\npercent to nearly 30 percent this means\nthat one in three one in three young men\nhave absolutely zero presence in the\nsexual Marketplace\non the other hand only roughly one in\nsix went\nin that age group reported the same\nthing\nthis creates a correspondence of roughly\nfive women for every four men\nand that assumes an even distribution\nacross the remaining participants which\nis absolutely not the case the top\nperforming men are not only having more\nsex with more women they're having a lot\nmore sex with a lot more women\nwhat does this mean well if you put two\nand two together it means that Society\nis becoming increasingly polygamous in\nwhich a smaller and smaller subset of\nmen are enjoying a larger share of the\nsexual access to all women\nto put that five to four ratio another\nway this means that 20 percent of women\nunder 30 are currently in a polygamous\nrelationship\nwhether they're aware of it or not\nthis situation is not conscious or\nintentional but the data back it up\nand just to be clear this is not\nsomething men are doing this is not\nsomething that men are forcing on women\nwhy well in the first place you have to\nremember that more men are getting less\nsex than they had 10 years ago so if\nthis is a conspiracy on the part of men\nthey're doing a really bad job of it and\nin the second place women are\nGatekeepers of sex\nthese women are not having sex with a\nsmaller subset of men against their will\nit's the women who are functionally\nvoting with their\nfeet\nthat it's either these men or no men at\nall for me thanks and what's the\nlikelihood that any one of these top men\nwho now have historically unprecedented\nsexual access to women what's the\nlikelihood that one of these top men is\ngoing to exclusively commit to any one\nof these women\nI would say that it becomes increasingly\nsmaller\nso this is one of the unintended\nconsequences of women's recent success\nand what are the solutions\nwell we know that there are several bad\nor unlikely ones including reactionary\nsocial movements that relegate women to\ntraditional gender roles or asking women\nto date and mate with men who are less\ndesirable to them\nI mean neither of those things are going\nto happen so to be honest the best\nsolution that I can come up with is to\nreally\nsupport men like to support men with at\nleast as much Vigor and enthusiasm as we\ncurrently support women\nso that the pool of desirable men\ncontinues to grow rather than shrink for\nmany years to come\nyou can be the judge of How likely that\nwill be anytime soon\nwhat do you think let me know your\nthoughts in the comments below and thank\nyou for listening"
