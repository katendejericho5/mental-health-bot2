    "transcript": "ever wonder why people in emotionally\nsatisfying relationships or with full\nand interesting lives in which they are\ncultivating meaning and purpose don't\nseem to fall in love it's not a\ncoincidence that people tend to fall in\nlove when they're dissatisfied with\ntheir careers or they're in an\nunsatisfying relationship or no\nrelationship at all or they're kind of\nlost or coasting through life there are\ncertain conditions under which a game of\nhideand-seek becomes more appropriate\nthis is not merely a diversion from bom\nor a distraction from the misery of\nexistence though of course it can be\nit's a way of motivating action how the\ngame of romance is functionally casting\nout a line that you've baited with\ncertain disavowed positive aspects of\nyourself so that you might catch\nyourself in a different location you'll\ncatch yourself in a different location\nbecause you've baited your lure with\nsomething that you want and you've cast\nyour line out beyond your present\ncircumstances at least in theory you\nhave"
