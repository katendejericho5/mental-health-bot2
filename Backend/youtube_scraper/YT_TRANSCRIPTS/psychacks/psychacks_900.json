    "transcript": "what you have to understand is that\ndating apps are like the city bus\nanybody can get on and that means that\nthere's going to be a wide swath of\nHumanity on these apps and there's going\nto be people who are going to like you\nand message you that you're not going to\nbe attracted to so if you're receiving a\nlot of that attention or you're swiping\nthrough a bunch of profiles you're not\nfinding anybody you like people are\nsubject to getting jaded and burned out\nby the whole experience so let me tell\nyou how I handled this situation\nwhenever I would reject somebody either\nby choosing not to respond to a message\nor swiping left I would\nsay to myself\nI hope they find what they're looking\nfor\nand I did this not because I'm a\nparticularly good person but because it\nblocked\nthe experience of more judgmental\nthoughts that would lead to me feeling\ncontempt disgust or resentment so it was\nprimarily selfish and self-protective\nand that actually allowed me to engage\nwith the apps more fruitfully"
