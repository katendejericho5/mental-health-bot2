    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is dating is\nlike buying a car\nwhat does this mean what you have to\nunderstand is that every relationship is\nactually a sustained negotiation between\ntwo people what are we going to do\ntogether for instance I might approach a\nwoman with a proposal let's have this\nkind of relationship and she might\ncounter with no let's have this kind of\nrelationship\nwho if anyone is going to get what they\nwant this has to be negotiated one way\nor the other if the relationship is to\nmove forward now before I unpack the\nramifications of this observation please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and I\nwould definitely do the same for you so\ndo the thing\nnow if you accept the fact that\nrelationship that negotiation in\nrelationship is inescapable and\nunavoidable you paradoxically have a\nmuch better chance of getting what you\nwant\nthis is why I tell my clients that they\nshould approach dating\nand relationships like they would\napproach buying a car\nyou need to do business with someone to\nbuy a car and in the beginning those\nbusiness interests are probably not\nreally aligned that is I want to buy the\ncar for the lowest price that I can and\nthe dealer wants to sell the car for the\nhighest price that he can our interests\nare not aligned and but we still might\nwant to do business with each other\nanyway\nnow imagine I really wanted to buy a car\nand I've been going around all day from\ndealership to dealership and I'm\nstarting to get hopeless over the\nprospect of ever finding a car\nI like where have all the good cars gone\nother people seem to have good cars are\nthere any good cars left why is this so\nhard and then on the point of Despair I\nwalk into one final dealership and\nWonder of Wonders I find this beautiful\ncar this high-powered muscle car that\nchecks all of my boxes and I decide yes\nthis is the car for me I will make it\nmine I am not going to walk into that\ndealership and say oh my God that is the\nperfect car I absolutely love this car\njust tell me what I have to do to get it\nyou want cash I got cash you want to\ncheck just who do I make it out to do\nyou need to prove do you need me to\nprove that I'm I'm worth it that I can\nafford it well here are all my\nfinancials I'm ready to buy this car no\nmatter what\nI would be putty in that dealer's hands\nseeing my enthusiasm he may even jack up\nthe price of the car because really\nwhat's his incentive not to at that\npoint and I might end up pricing myself\nout of a good option because of my own\nineptitude\ndo you understand what I'm getting at no\nmatter how interested you are in that\ncar you need to walk into that\ndealership\nand seem indifferent\noh that\nyeah it's a nice car I guess I don't\nreally love the color is that a dent\nI mean\nwe might be able to do something if the\nprice is right but I do have a few other\nplaces I gotta check out first that is\nhow you negotiate a good deal for your\ncar\neven if that car checks every single one\nof your criteria you kind of have to\nstrategically pretend that it doesn't\nbecause doing so puts you in a better\nposition of getting what you want\npeople have no problem doing this if it\nsaves them a few hundred dollars however\nsuggest that they do the same thing in\ndating\nwhich where the cost of getting a bad\ndeal is infinitely more expensive and\npeople suddenly become one big scruple\nthis is stupid this is stupid because it\nindicates that they're willing to do\nmore to save a little money on a car\nthan they are to have the kind of\nrelationship they want to have with the\nkind of person they want to have it with\ndon't be stupid\nnow to continue the line of thought from\nmy previous episode The reason why\nindifference works on people is\nsurprising think back to the fundamental\nLaw of Attraction people want what they\nwant not what wants them this means that\nyou cannot want someone into wanting you\nand one of the reasons why this is true\nis because if I'm wanting you intensely\nI'm not really giving you the\nopportunity to Want Me intensely\nand that's a bad deal\nfor you\nwhy because if you don't want me then I\ncan't give you what you want which is\nwhat everybody wants people want to get\nwhat they want and by pulling back and\nassuming indifference you create the\nopportunity for others to want you which\nis a prerequisite for them to get what\nthey want\nit's also the only real reason anybody\nis ever going to take the trouble to\ndeal with you at all to get what they\nwant if you're wanting them more than\nthe best they can do is to give you what\nyou want that is not an attractive offer\nto most people because people want to\nget what they want create opportunities\nfor this to occur\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
