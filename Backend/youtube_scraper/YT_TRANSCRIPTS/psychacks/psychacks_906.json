    "transcript": "most people have it exactly backwards\nthey say to themselves I want a\ngirlfriend or I'm ready to settle down\nand have a husband and then they go out\nsearching for somebody to fit into this\npre-existing mold this pre-existing idea\nof the kind of relationship they would\nlike to have and this as you might\nimagine creates a lot of unnecessary\nfriction in your relationships the fact\nof the matter is is that you can't have\nany relationship with just anybody\nyou can only have certain types of\nrelationships with certain people to\ninsist that you should be able to have\nany relationship you desire with any\nindividual you desire to have it with\nflies in the face of reality\na much better idea is to spend time with\nsomebody that you connect with that you\nhave chemistry with that you enjoy\ngetting to know and then seeing what\nkind of relationship the two of you can\nhave the relationship should evolve\norganically out of your connection and\nit should fit the people involved\ninstead of the other way around"
