    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is younger\nmen and older women\nso this episode is a response to some of\nthe questions that were posted in the\ncomments of my episode why men like\nyounger women folks wanted to know well\nwhat about the opposite what about when\nyounger men enter into relationships\nwith older women what does that mean\nwhat do you have to say about that well\nit turns out I have a lot to say about\nthat but before I get into it please\nremember to like this episode And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\na great way to get the Cougars to come\nrunning if that's what you're into so do\nthe thing back to it so what does it\nmean when a younger woman excuse me when\na younger man enters into a relationship\nwith an older woman well in the first\nplace it probably means that the man is\nYoung this Dynamic is much more likely\nto occur when the man is 25 and the\nwoman is 40 and when the man is 40 and\nthe woman is 55. so this kind of\nrelationship younger man older woman is\nkind of time-bound it generally occurs\nwhen men are in their early 20s and\nwomen are in their late 30s early 40s\nand I gotta say\nthis Arrangement has a lot to speak for\nitself it can be a really good\nrelationship and I'm speaking from\npersonal experience when I was in my\nearly 20s I had a number of lovers in\ntheir late 30s and I'm really grateful\nto these women we had a fantastic time\nthey really helped me to become more\nconfident in relationships and I'm still\non good terms with all of them today I\nwish them all the best so I I would\nactually highly recommend this\nrelationship to the young men out there\nand there's a number of reasons why this\nDynamic can be really good for both\nparties let's go back to my handy Bandy\ngraph on sexual Marketplace values as a\nfunction of age derived from the Paper\naspirational Mate selection and online\ndating markets here it is so where are\nthe young men they are here\nand where are the older women the women\nin their late 30s they are\nhere\nand would you look at that\nand would you look at that\nthese two groups are on the same power\nlevel how fascinating and this kind of\nmakes sense there's nothing wrong with\nyoung men per se but in general women\ndon't want them they have no wealth or\nstatus or experience and there's nothing\nwrong with older women per se but in\ngeneral men don't want them they're not\nas physically attractive as their\nyounger competition so what you have are\ntwo gendered classes at two different\nstages of their lives that are generally\nequivalent with respect to their\nnormalized sexual normalized sexual\nMarketplace values so it kind of makes\nsense that they would find each other\nnow this Dynamic younger man older woman\nis really good for the short term like a\nfew years Max and that's because on some\nlevel both parties know\nthat starting a family is probably not\nin the cards and that works both ways\nthe woman probably isn't going to want\nto reproduce with a young guy in his\nearly 20s who may not have a job or a\ncareer or much in terms of material\nprospects and vice versa the man\nprobably isn't going to want to take on\nthat kind of responsibility with a woman\nwho's nearing the end of her biological\nwindow so it's like both parties know\nthat they're there really to enjoy\nthemselves\nsocially we think that the older man\nyounger woman Dynamic is primarily\nsexual\nhowever that's not the case and that's\nbecause beyond the sexual element both\nparties are actually in an ideal\nsituation to reproduce and start a\nfamily the conditions are at least ripe\nfor that to happen and there is a\nreality-based likelihood that it will\nthat's not really the case in a younger\nman older woman Dynamic which typically\nis primarily sexual these relationships\nare all about enjoying the pleasure of\neach other's company and there are a few\nreasons why this Dynamic lends itself to\na sexual relationship so well in the\nfirst place a young man's libido is\nnever gonna get higher they're basically\ninsatiable at that age on the other hand\nthere's a lot of research that indicates\nthat women's desire for sex tends to\nincrease as they get older so you have\ntwo people entering into a relationship\nwith very high sex drives if not the\nhighest sex drives that they will ever\nhave across their entire lifespans young\nmen want to have sex and older women\noften don't have the same Hang-Ups about\nsex that younger women do so there's\nless game playing about it\nand here's something else to consider\nmen are just sort of expected to know\nwhat to do with a woman\nno one's really supposed to teach him\nand no one really does he's just\nsupposed to know\nand when he doesn't he can feel\ninadequate and his Partners if he's\nfortunate enough to have any can feel\nresentful\nyoung women in particular generally have\nneither the ability nor the inclination\nto teach men how to be good lovers they\ncan be extremely impatient and they can\nget away with being extremely impatient\non the other hand older women can have\nthis patient feminine energy about them\nthat can help a guy learn without\nshaming or blaming him when he\ninevitably makes mistakes and this of\ncourse can serve the woman in question\nas well because she can sort of subtly\nguide him toward what works for her if\nshe's willing to put in the time to do\nso it can be a win-win relationship\nand that's what I have to say today\nabout younger men and older women\nthere's more but I'll save that for\nanother episode let me know what you\nthink in the comments below and thank\nyou for listening"
