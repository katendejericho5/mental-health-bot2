    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nmen treat women\nthe way women treat money\nso after my episode women treat men the\nwing men treat jobs I got a lot of\nrequests for the complementary treatment\nbasically what are women to men\nafter giving it some thought this is the\nresult\njust keep in mind what I said in that\nprevious episode that it was\nunderstanding where women were coming\nfrom that helped me to make sense of a\nlot of otherwise painful and bewildering\nthings that women did and this\nunderstanding helped me to heal accept\nand ultimately enjoy more fulfilling\nrelationships with women\nmy intention here is to do the same\nthing for you ladies if you can\nunderstand without judgment\nwhere men are coming from this should\nhelp you heal accept and ultimately\nenjoy more fulfilling relationships with\nmen the key here is without judgment\nmay be asking too much but there it is\nand that's the spirit in which all of\nthis is being given I'm here to help\nnow before I get into it please remember\nto like this video And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's a great way\nto show your love thanks for your help\nokay so women treat men the way men\ntreat jobs and men treat women the way\nwomen treat money\nat first blast you might be thinking\nsame same but different but they're not\nthe same thing at all\nthink of all the associations you have\nabout work\nversus all the associations you have\nabout money\nremember work is really a means to an\nend no one shows up to work for work\nthey show up for a paycheck this is why\nwomen typically have relationship goals\nthey see the relationship as a means to\nan end just like men see a job as a\nmeans to a paycheck\nbut for when but for men\nwomen are the paycheck they're the money\nwhen we get into a relationship with you\nit doesn't need to go anywhere because\nwe're finally where we wanted to be it's\npayday it's the second Saturday of the\nsecond Friday of the month you know what\nI'm saying it's our time to relax and\nhave fun and we think that way because\nof the incredible amount of work it took\nto get you\nthis cannot be overstated most women\nhave absolutely no conception of the\nsheer amount of effort and time and\nskill and resource that goes into\ngetting you\nbecause you don't see it it all happens\nbefore you say yes\nthis is really important so let me try\nto help you understand this when a guy\napproaches you in the bar on the street\nand chats you up and you're attracted to\nhim enough to give him your number or\nwhen you match with a guy on a dating\napp and you text back and forth and\nyou're attracted enough to actually meet\nup with him how long does the whole\ninteraction take place\njust a few minutes in the first case and\nprobably just a few days in the second\nfrom your perspective\nfrom the man's perspective it actually\ntook years\nacross hundreds of attempts\nI work with a lot of guys on pickup and\nattraction\nat this stage in my life I can walk into\na crowded bar and walk out an hour later\nwith a handful of numbers\nbut the fact of the matter is that it's\ntaken me 10 years to be able to pick a\nwoman up in 10 minutes\nit takes a lot of work to be confident\nto be Charming to be smooth to be\nsuccessful to be witty to be\nself-controlled\nand you don't see any of that work\nladies you didn't stick around to see it\nbut we do the work for the same reason\nthat you do your job we want the\npaycheck\nbut here's the thing just like a lot of\nwomen secretly resent all the work that\nthey have to do to get paid and would\nprefer to just have money\na lot of men secretly resent all the\nwork they have to do to get into a\nrelationship\nand would prefer to just have women\nand the more difficult it is for people\nto get something the harder it is for\nthem to give it up and the easier it is\nfor them to take it when it's offered\nand the more they want something the\neasier it is to rationalize doing\nwhatever it takes to get it\nwomen how easy is it for you to spend\nyour hard-earned money\ndidn't you prefer to spend someone\nelse's money before you had to spend\nyour own of course you would and on some\nlevel it's perfectly rational for you to\nhave that preference\nbut just like women would prefer not to\nspend their own money which they earned\nif they don't have to\nmen would prefer not to forego women\nthe access to which they earned if they\ndon't have to men do more work than\nwomen to earn their optionality so it's\nhard for men to give that optionality up\nfor the same reason it's also easier to\ntake when it's offered ladies how often\nhave you turned down free money\nassuming it was being offered in good\nfaith probably never\nif someone offered you money like as a\ngift you probably wouldn't say oh no\nthank you I have enough money\nand you certainly wouldn't say oh no\nthanks I have a salary\nit's very hard to turn down free money\nand you probably couldn't think of a\ngood reason to do so anyway your\nemployer might not be thrilled about it\nbut why well if his employees could get\nmoney without working for it then he\nkind of couldn't use money to\nincentivize employees to be the means to\nhis ends anymore\nat least not without offering a better\ndeal\nfree money would drive up the price of\nemployment that said we're probably not\nin danger of that happening anytime soon\nby the same token it's extremely hard\nfor a man to turn down a woman who is\noffering herself to him\nof course the socially acceptable thing\nfor him to say is oh no thanks I already\nhave a woman so I already have enough\nwoman thanks\nthey probably turn down women\nsignificantly more often than women turn\ndown money however it's very very very\nhard to do so\nand of course it doesn't always happen\nhis woman might not be thrilled about it\nbut why\nwell if men could get sex without\nworking for it\nthen women kind of couldn't use sex to\nincentivize men to be the means to her\nends anymore\nat least not without offering a better\ndeal\nfree sex would drive up the price of\ncommitment\ndo you understand\nand that leads me to my final Point\nwomen let's say that you've worked hard\nfor your money and you want to enjoy the\nfruits of your labor for many years to\ncome\nI decide to consult with a financial\nadvisor on how best to invest your\nhard-earned cash\ndo you think that advisor would ever\nunder any circumstances ever\ncounsel you to put all of your money in\nOne stock\nof course not no one in their right mind\nwould advise you to do that the advisor\nwould tell you to diversify your\nportfolio because in case the market\ngoes south you're not going to be\ncompletely taken to the cleaners do you\nsee\nthe diversification of your portfolio is\nan essential component of husbanding\nyour finances properly what a strange\ncoincidence that that word would show up\ninto that context huh by the same token\na lot of men let's say diversify their\nportfolios with women\nladies it's not personal\nin fact if you can look at it\nobjectively it's kind of the rational\nmove\njust like it's not really prudent to\ninvest your life savings in only one\nstock a lot of men correctly see the\nrisk of investing entirely in one woman\nespecially if that woman could leave at\na moment's notice with no real recourse\nand I'd like to argue that this is\npotentially as much a part of man's\nnature as it is a part of woman's nature\nto choose the best available\ncompensation package or to leave a\npre-existing position for a better offer\nshaming and blaming either way does\nlittle to change reality contrary to\nwhat the internet will tell you a man is\nnot necessarily a narcissist if he has\nmore than one woman he could be but he's\nnot necessarily according to one study\nlink in the pinned comment below 46 of\nmen 46 percent admitted to maintaining a\nsexual relationship with more than one\nperson during the same time period\nand that's just the percentage of men\nwho admitted to it on the contrary\nepidemiological studies approximate that\nabout five percent of all people are\nnarcissists when men have other women\nthey don't do so because they're\npathological how can it be abnormal when\nhalf of men do it\nwhen men have other women they do so\nbecause it's really really hard to turn\ndown free money\nand it's really really stupid to invest\nall your money in one stock\nladies the more you look at how you\ntreat your own money the more you'll\nunderstand how men are going to treat\nyou\nand the more you accept reality the more\nthings start to make sense\nthe faster you start to heal\nand the sooner you start to get what you\nwant\nI know it's hard to see things from the\nperspective of the other side but trust\nme it is worth it to make the effort\nwhat do you think remember to be\nrespectful and let me know in the\ncomments below\nthanks for listening"
