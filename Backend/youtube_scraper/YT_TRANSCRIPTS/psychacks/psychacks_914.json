    "transcript": "so I've seen this over and over again in\nmy professional practice the number one\nsign that your wife that your girlfriend\nis thinking of leaving you is\nshe starts going to the gym\nespecially if it's sort of out of the\nblue\nshe starts going to the gym she gets a\npersonal trainer you ask well what's\nthat about and she says no reason\nthis is a bad sign means that the clock\nis ticking and basically she's already\nthinking about re-entering into the\nsexual Marketplace and she's going to\nuse the security of that relationship to\nget herself ready and when she is in a\nbetter position to compete successfully\nin that Marketplace because she might\nhave become comfortable in the\nrelationship over the last several years\nthat's when she's going to pull the\ntrigger on leaving the relationship if\nthings have not improved in her\nsubjective opinion"
