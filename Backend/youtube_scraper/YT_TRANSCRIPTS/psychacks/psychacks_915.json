    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology on the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nrecognition is a poor man's currency so\nthis is something that can trip up a lot\nof folks especially in the context of\ntheir professional lives\na lot of people are looking for\nrecognition and a lot of people\nexperience a great deal of frustration\nand resentment when they believe that\ntheir efforts are not sufficiently\nrecognized by their employer their\norganization Etc\nand I can totally understand that I have\nfelt those feelings in the past but I'm\nhere to tell you that recognition\nis a poor man's currency\nbut before I explain what that means\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and you\ncan consider it your good deed for the\nday\nso do the thing\nlet's put it this way\nthe importance of recognition is\ninversely proportional to the degree to\nwhich you are paid in other ways\nso to give you a very concrete example\nwhat if in exchange for one of your\nbrilliant ideas\nI will give you one million dollars\non the condition that no one could ever\nknow that you came up with it would you\nbe okay with that\nleaving aside some Fantastical Fringe\ncases I would be okay with that I would\nkeep my mouth shut for a million bucks\nI'd rather have the million than the\nrecognition\nthis is obviously a hyperbolic example\nbut it kind of proves my point which is\nthe greater the value of the other forms\nof payment you receive the less\nimportant recognition becomes\non the other hand recognition becomes\nreally really important\nwhen your efforts don't result in making\nyou much money when they don't result in\nmaking your life easier when they don't\nresult in increasing future opportunity\nin these cases because you're not being\ncompensated in other ways you're really\ngoing to want to be paid in recognition\nso recognition is a poor man's currency\nand that's because rich men get paid in\nmoney\nrich men get paid in having their lives\nimproved rich men get paid in increasing\nopportunity when I was a starving artist\nhow did the producers pay me in exposure\nwhen I was an unpaid intern how did\ndirectors pay me in experience\nand in both of those cases recognition\nfor my efforts was significantly more\nimportant to me than it is today\nwhat else did I have\nI would encourage listeners struggling\nwith this problem to seek out better\ncompensation in other ways because at\nthe end of the day recognition is kind\nof an ego based Drive which means that\nit's something of a trap\na trap that in this case can ensnare you\nin poverty and pettiness and envy among\nother things\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below thank you for\nlistening"
