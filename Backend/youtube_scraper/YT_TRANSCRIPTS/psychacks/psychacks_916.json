    "transcript": "most relationship needs are really\nrelationship wants the fact of the\nmatter is is that human beings need very\nlittle in order to thrive one of those\nthings is some measure of psychological\nor emotional safety or security so\nabusive relationships are an exception\nto this rule because\nthose abusive relationships are\nviolating a basic human need but in the\nvast majority of cases when people say\nthat their needs aren't being met it's\nactually probably more honest to say\nthat their their wants aren't being met\nand I think the conflation of needs and\nwants does two things one it makes the\nother person out to be worse than they\nare because not giving somebody\nsomething that they need feels and\nsounds a lot worse than not giving\nsomebody something that they want and\ntwo it imbues the other the feeling of\nthe other person with this intensity\nbecause if you confuse what you want for\nwhat you need there's going to be this\nlike existential threat of survival to\nnot getting what you want"
