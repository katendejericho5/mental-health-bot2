    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology on the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\nsuccessful men cheat this is a\nfascinating question\nbecause it does seem to be a rampant\nphenomenon among successful men doesn't\nit we see this behavior in presidents in\nmovie stars and world-class athletes and\nbillionaires\nit just doesn't seem like a coincidence\nthat all these men who come from all\ndifferent walks of life and who attain\nsuccess in so many independent domains\nof achievement\nwould just happen to manifest the same\nbehavior as especially given how\nsocially unacceptable the behavior is\nI also don't think we can just call them\nnarcissists I'm sure some of them are\nhowever in this case it would kind of be\naffirming the consequence so maybe\nthere's something else in play here\nand before I get into what that might be\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nan easy way to get a hit of dopamine so\ndo the thing\non the surface\non the surface\nthe cheating behavior of successful men\nis entirely irrational\nand why is that because in such cases\nthe risk reward profile is insanely High\na man might lose his fortune his career\nhis reputation his family and his social\nopportunities\nfor a sexual escapade\nI mean that's about as big a risk as a\nman can take for potentially not a great\ndeal of pleasure\nso it doesn't make rational sense that\nsuccessful men would risk it all just to\nhave an adventure\nand these guys didn't arrive at the Apex\nof their respective domains by being\nirrational\nmy general rule of thumb is that most\npeople are mostly rational so if a\nbehavior looks irrational from the\noutside that's usually due to the\ninterpretive frame through which we're\nviewing it assuming is a person is\nactually behaving rationally can allow\nus to learn a lot about how the behavior\npotentially makes sense\nand the same is true here\ncheating in successful men becomes\nrational if we flip our understanding\nit's not that these\nthese incests for the sake of an affair\nit's that these men spent their lives\nbecoming successful in order to have the\naffair to begin with\nwe can argue that the whole point of\ntheir success of being the best in the\nworld in business and politics and\nAthletics conscious or not\nwas to secure easier\naccess to more and more desirable women\nthat's why they work so hard\nwhether they were aware of it or not\na man would invent an eighth day of the\nweek if it meant he could get easier\naccess to more and more desirable women\nnow sometimes this is conscious like in\nthe movie Scarface first you get the\nmoney then you get the power then you\nget the women\nwe think it's ghost to say it out loud\nbut we all kind of know that it's true\nat the very least we can all agree that\nit's never the other way around like\nfirst you get the women and then you get\nthe power and then you get the money\nthat statement makes no sense right\nhowever in most cases this objective is\nunconscious\ncouple this with the fact that men don't\nreally even begin to have good\noptionality until they're in their 30s\nand 40s\nby which point most of them have already\ngotten married\nyou have a recipe for infidelity\nthe desire coupled with the optionality\njust makes for a Temptation larger than\nmany men can bear it's like the ring of\npower even wholesome little Frodo gets\ncorrupted in the end\nwhat you need to consider is that these\npowerful successful men have actually\ndeferred their ratification for quite\nsome time sometimes decades in the\nservice of their Ambitions and\nExcellence which is itself in the\nservice of better access to potential\nmates\nsocially expecting a person to then\nforego the sought after reward when it's\nfinally offered after years of deferment\nis probably unreasonable\nshould these men never have gotten\nmarried in the first place\npotentially but people are complicated\nand the reality is that sexual\nexclusivity is just one aspect of most\nmarriages and it's generally not the\nprimary reason that is people don't get\nmarried to be sexually exclusive you can\ndo that without getting married they\ntypically get married to have children\nand start a family in a protected way\nthrowing the baby out with the bath\nwater isn't always the best idea and of\ncourse if we think this might be true\nwe should probably not be pressuring men\nto get married which absolutely\ncontinues to happen\nLeo DiCaprio gets a lot of flack for\nstaying single and dating beautiful\nwomen in his late 40s however if he had\ngotten married he would have gotten even\nmore Flack if he cheated on his wife or\ndivorced her for a younger woman\nthe end goal of male ambition and drive\nis to secure better and wider access to\nwomen\nit is what it is\nand this of course is really only\npossible because the outcomes of male\nambition and drive namely success and\nStatus happened to be\nthe general preferences of women\nso it's a two-way street\nthis is basically an evolutionary\nargument which suggests that these roots\nare very deep\nand that's why the higher up the social\nhierarchy you go the more you will see\nthis kind of behavior no matter what\nhierarchy you look at\non some level it's the point the\nhierarchies exist in the first place\nand if we can leave aside any moral\njudgments we might have\nwe should therefore expect to see this\nbehavior in successful and powerful men\nin all walks of life in every domain of\nExcellence which is of course what we do\nin fact see\nso let's not be so shocked when it\nhappens\nwhat do you think\nkeep it respectful and let me know in\nthe comments below thanks for listening"
