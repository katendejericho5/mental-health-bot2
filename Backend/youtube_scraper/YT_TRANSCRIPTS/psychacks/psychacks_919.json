    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taravan and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is shared\ninterests\nare overrated\nso this is something that I see a lot of\npeople doing on the dating Market\nthey're filtering potential partners for\nshared interests and I can appreciate\nthe rationale for doing so has a grain\nof truth to it like if there's zero van\noverlap between what you like to do in\nyour spare time and what the other\nperson likes to do in their spare time\nit's going to be difficult to move the\nrelationship forward\nhowever shared interests are generally\nnot what bring people together and\nthey're definitely not what allow a\nrelationship to flourish now before I\nexplain my own reasoning please remember\nto like this video And subscribe to this\nchannel thanks less than a second costs\nyou nothing and it's what you secretly\nwant to do anyway so do the thing\nhere's the situation a person's\ninterests are facts I like reading\nhiking dining and meditating\nthey are more or less objective\nverifiable and utterly boring\npeople do not become attracted to others\nby virtue of factual disclosure even if\nand this is important even if those\nthings may be what the other person is\nlooking for guys do this all the time\nwhen they drop subtle and not so subtle\nhints about how much money they make on\na date it doesn't work\non the other hand people do become\nattracted to how you feel about your\ninterests there's a big difference\nbetween saying I like hiking\nand I love the feeling of pushing myself\noutside my comfort zone is it weird to\nsay that I also like the danger and\nSolitude like I feel so alive when I\nrealize I'm on my own\nget the picture\nthe sheer fact that you like the same\nmusic or movies or that you both like to\ntravel or dine out tells me absolutely\nnothing about whether you're the type of\nperson\nI would actually like to do those things\nwith\nturns out that people don't like their\ninterests so much that they'll do them\nwith just anybody\nand most interests aren't even reliable\nproxies for personality traits or\ncharacteristics did you know that DMX\nthe rapper was an avid Orchid gardener\nfact\nwhat initially brings people together is\nattraction which largely pertains to\nwhat you did to get the date to begin\nwith and chemistry which pertains to how\nyou feel with the other person on that\ndate\nshared interests do not increase\nattraction or chemistry so it doesn't\nreally make sense to sort for them why\nbecause best case scenario you might end\nup with someone who seems like a good\nfit on paper\nbut for whom you feel nothing for and\nthat's not really ideal\nbut here's the real reason why shared\ninterests are overrated think of all\nyour interests today\nwere they the same interests that you\nhad five years ago\nabout 10 years ago\n20 years ago\nprobably not\nmaybe one or two things have remained\nconstant but the vast majority of your\ninterests are different today\nokay so every seven to ten years you are\nfunctionally going to become a different\nperson and every seven to ten years your\npartner is functionally going to become\na different person\nif the basis of your relationship is\nshared interests and your interests\nchange every seven to ten years and\ntheir interests change every seven to\nten years\nthen what's the basis of your\nrelationship seven to ten years from now\nit's like either you can't allow people\nto change which is a kind of death\nor you have to admit that there's\nsomething that keeps a relationship\ntogether Beyond shared activities\nin my opinion what's way more important\nthan shared interests is mutual\ntolerance for example I like to go\nbackpacking I like to go out into the\nWilderness and rough it and sleep on the\nground and get real dirty and not every\nwoman is into that it's nice if a woman\nexpresses interest in that then we can\ndo that every once in a while but she's\nprobably not going to be into it as much\nas I am and that willingness probably\nisn't going to be sufficient reason for\nme to enter into that relationship with\nher all things being equal anyway\nand that's okay\nshe doesn't have to be into it as long\nas she tolerates that I'm into it and\nthat means she doesn't obstruct or\notherwise punish me for doing that in my\nspare time without her\nwe don't have to do everything together\nin fact that's usually a recipe for\ngenerating all sorts of resentment in a\nrelationship it's much better to filter\nfor tolerance of another person's\ndifferences than for alignment in\nsimilarities\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
