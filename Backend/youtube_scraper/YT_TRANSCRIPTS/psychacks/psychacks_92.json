    "transcript": "the fundamental game at the heart of\nromantic relationships is hideand-seek\nit's very simple it kind of works like\nthis first I am going to cut out a part\nof myself and then I'm going to hide\nthat part of myself in somewhat of my\nchoosing and then I'm going to forget\nabout the cutting and the hiding and the\nchoosing the forgetting is actually a\nvery important part of all this because\nas we'll see becoming increasingly aware\nof this mechanism of action ruins the\nentire game after all if you're going to\nhave any fun seeking you can't already\nknow where you've hidden the thing that\nyou're looking for now can you but those\nare the rules that's how you play\nthere's the cutting and the hiding and\nthe choosing and the forgetting"
