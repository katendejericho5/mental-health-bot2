    "transcript": "well the main reason for this is dating\nhas gone online\na lot of women don't really appreciate\nhow anxiety provoking it is for most men\nto go up to a strange woman that he's\nattracted to and strike up a\nconversation with the objective of\npicking her up\nit's not easy\nI'm not saying that you women are\nintimidating I've approached hundreds\nand hundreds of women in my time and not\nnot a single one of them has ever been\nrude or aggressive\nin fact even if they tell me no they\ntend to be flattered by the attention\nbut a lot of guys they they get in their\nheads they which leads to hesitation\nparalysis\nit's very difficult for the average guy\nto approach a woman when they can just\nswipe anonymously there is absolutely no\nthreat of rejection online and that's\nwhy men don't approach women anymore"
