    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\ninside is overrated\nso this might sound strange coming from\na therapist but this is a lesson that I\nactually learned during my years as a\npsychological intern during that time I\nspent two years at an outpatient drug\nand alcohol treatment program and it was\nwithin this context that I understood\nthat insight into a problem that is why\nit exists and how it operates\nis not actually sufficient or necessary\nto solve the problem Insight is in a\nword\noverrated now before I back this up\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel takes less than\na second cost you nothing and it's how\nyou can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help\nnow in my time I've worked to some\nhighly insightful but inveterate\ndrinkers our program was not their first\nrodeo many had been to several other\nover the course of their lives and when\nI sat down with these folks and asked\nthem why they drank they would tell me\nWell my father and my maternal\ngrandfather were both alcoholics so\nthere's the genetic component and I grew\nup in this dysfunctional family system\nwhere my role was The Golden Child\nbecause of that I had this enormous\npressure put on me to achieve and when I\nfailed I felt shame so I used alcohol as\na way to numb my shame rather than\nprocess my emotions because I did not\nhave sufficient modeling for that\nbehavior I also Now understand that I\nhad an oral fixation likely because my\nmother didn't breastfeed me and I was\nusing the bottle as a substitute for the\nnipple and on and on and on and on about\nall kinds of stuff\nthey also understood why they would\nrelapse they could do this really\nspecific in-depth chain analysis like oh\nwell I saw this commercial about\nretirement homes which made me think\nabout my father who would always have a\nbeer after work and I suddenly had this\nfantasy about how nice would be to have\na cold beer on a hot day and watch a\nbaseball game and I thought well I\ndeserve to treat myself to a beer in a\nbaseball game after all the hard work\nI've done and I thought that since I'd\nalready been sober for three months I\nhad some control over my drinking so I\ndecided to go out and have a beer as a\nreward and one led to five and five led\nto fifty and well you know here I am\nthese people\nknew exactly where their problem came\nfrom\nthey knew exactly what maintained their\nproblem\nand yet they continued to drink\ninsight into the origin and the\noperation of the problem was\ninsufficient\nand I saw this play out over and over\nand over again it was\nboggling\non the other hand some guys would come\nin and I'd ask them about their drinking\nand they'd say\nyeah I don't know it just didn't make me\nfeel good so I decided to stop\nthat's it\nthese guys didn't know why they didn't\nknow how\nbut they managed to work toward a\nsolution and while it's a bit of an\noversimplification I think we can all\nagree that not drinking is kind of an\nimportant component to addressing one's\nalcoholism\nthis is generalizable in the absence of\ninsight you can solve a problem by\nchanging your behavior you don't have to\neven understand why it works and this is\ngood because spoiler alert no one really\nknows anyway\nat the end of the day all the Insight in\nthe world does not translate into an\nounce of action and it's action taking a\ndifferent path at the crossroads of Our\nLives that actually solves problems we\ndon't have to know where the problem\ncomes from we don't have to know how the\nproblem operates sometimes we just have\nto make a different choice\nhopefully that makes sense\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
