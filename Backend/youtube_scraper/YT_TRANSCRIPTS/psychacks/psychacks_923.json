    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat's in it for me\nso when this question occurs in the\ncontext of romantic relationships this\nquestion of what's in it for me can come\noff as selfish or even mercenary there\nis a great resistance to approaching\nromantic relationships from this\nperspective as it seems to reduce them\nto the level of transactional exchange a\nrelationship becomes a bartering of\nsorts you get this and in return I get\nthat and my response to this would be\nwhat's wrong with that\nnow before I defend my position please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to this channel takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld thank you for your help\nback to my argument\nthe thing is that people need things\nfrom other people and the medium through\nwhich value is exchanged between people\nis called a relationship\nthink about it guys in a relationship if\none person isn't asking what's in it for\nme\nthat relationship is exploitative\nand if one person can't ask what's in it\nfor me\nthat's slavery\nand I don't think anybody here is going\nto be defending exploitation or slavery\nanytime soon\non the other hand when both parties ask\nwhat's in it for me\nThat's the basis of free and Equitable\nnegotiation\nand unless both people can ask that\nquestion you don't have freedom and you\ndon't have equality\nand that means that there's something\nexploitative baked into the very\nFoundation of that relationship\nasking what's in it for me is not\nmercenary or insulting it's the basis of\nfree and Equitable relationship\nthat said this question absolutely rubs\nsome people the wrong way which is a\nlittle sus\nI mean think about it if this question\ncan't be asked we're dealing with an\nexploitative relationship\nand who is likely to be more wrinkled by\nthis question being asked the exploited\nor the exploiter\nobviously it would be the exploiter who\nwould be more upset by this question as\nit threatens the basis of his or her\nexploitation\nsomeone who is prepared to provide\nsomething of value to the other party\nwould have no problems with this\nquestion in fact he or she would invite\nthis question as its answer indicates\nthe basis upon which a free and\nEquitable relationship could be\nestablished\nall this is perfectly rational however\nwe have this really intense cultural\nprogramming against asking this question\nin the context of our romantic\nrelationships and I think wherever you\nfind the most resistance to this idea\nyou also tend to find the most\ninequitable relationships\nexamine it for yourself\nwhat do you think please let me know in\nthe comments below and thank you for\nlistening"
