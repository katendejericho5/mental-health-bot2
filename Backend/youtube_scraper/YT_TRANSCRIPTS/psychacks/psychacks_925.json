    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the myth\nof completion completion\nis a myth it doesn't actually exist in\nreality and that's because nothing is\never finished it just transitions into a\ndifferent form a great example of this\nis evolution evolution is never finished\nand that's because Evolution doesn't\nactually have a static goal it's basic\nintention is to constantly provide the\nbest fit between organisms and their\nsurrounding environment but as the\nenvironment changes the concept of best\nfit changes as well which in turn\nchanges the environment odd infinitum\nlike most things in life evolution is a\nnever-ending process so why do people\nthink that completion exists now before\nI explain this tendency please remember\nto like this video And subscribe to this\nchannel it takes less than a second cost\nyou nothing and it's how you can support\nme and my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world thank you\nfor your help\nall right the reason why people believe\nthat completion exists is due to a bias\ninherent in perspective\nand the best way to illustrate that bias\nis to examine the difference in\nperspective between Creator and observer\nlet's take a famous piece of art like\nthe Mona Lisa for instance now from the\nobserver's perspective the Mona Lisa is\na finished work of art we have we all\nhave an idea of what it is and we can\nexamine and count and tabulate all the\nbrush Strokes that went into its\ncomposition from this perspective from\nthe perspective of the Observer the Mona\nLisa is complete\nhowever it's a different story from the\nperspective of the Creator there was no\nobjective sign given to Leonardo da\nVinci that not a single additional brush\nstroke was necessary to complete his\nmasterpiece it might be hard to imagine\nthe Mona Lisa different from how it is\nhowever that is an observer problem Da\nVinci didn't have that problem\ncreators like Da Vinci know all too well\nthat something can always be added and\nsomething can always be taken away\nand if he had decided to do so then that\nwould have been the Mona Lisa that we\nwould now all think is complete the idea\nof completion lies entirely in our heads\nas an artifact of our perspective by us\nas Observers\ncreators understand that they never\nreally complete anything\nthey just sort of decide that they're\ndone\nthe thing itself is not finished it just\nlooks finished to the outside Observer\nthey could always do more and they could\nalways do less\nhowever it's this perspective bias that\nfacilitates the myth of completion and\nit really messes people up especially\nwith respect to their relationships\nthe truth is that it's always going to\nfeel like there's something more you\ncould have said or there's something\nmore you could have done\njust like there is always another brush\nstroke that could have been added to the\npainting\nrelationships are never finished\npeople just decide to stop working on\nthem\nand there's no objective sign that tells\nthe people involved when to stop\nit's a subjective decision and only the\ncreators of the relationship can know\nwhen to move on\nwhat do you think\nplease let me know in the comments below\nand thank you for listening"
