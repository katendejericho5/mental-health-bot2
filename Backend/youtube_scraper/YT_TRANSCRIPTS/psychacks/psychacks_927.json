    "transcript": "there are really two components to this\nthe first is to very deeply appreciate\nthe fundamental Law of Attraction which\nis that people want what they want not\nwhat wants them which suggests that you\ncannot want someone into wanting you in\nfact the more that you want someone\nthe more it reduces the likelihood that\nthey're going to want you back on some\nlevel you're doing the wanting for both\nof them\nso this should be the framework which\nwill motivate you to do the second part\nyou'll understand that this is actually\nin your best interests to stop this sort\nof obsessive rumination and to actually\nbegin the process requires\nconsistent use of the block and replace\ntechnique\nthe thoughts come up you say no I don't\nwant to think about that person no I\ndon't want to think about that right now\nand you replace that thought with\nsomething else entirely you might have\nto do that 500 times a day but trust me\nit gets easier"
