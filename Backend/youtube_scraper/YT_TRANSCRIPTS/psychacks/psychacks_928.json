    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nPeak sexual Marketplace value so in this\nepisode I'm going to be talking about\nanother one of my favorite articles on\ndating entitled aspirational pursuit of\nmates and online dating markets for\nthose of you who want to look it up it\nappeared in the American Association for\nthe advancement of Sciences\npeer-reviewed journals science advances\nin 2018 volume 4 issue 8 and there's a\nlink to the article in the description\nnow this article is a little dense\nbecause it was actually written by\nnon-psychologists it was written by two\nUniversity of Michigan professors one of\nwhom belongs to the Department of\nsociology and the other of whom belongs\nto the Department of physics and the\nstudy of complex systems which I love\nbecause there are a few things in life\nmore complex than dating now before I\nunpack the results of this study please\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing really\nand it's how you can support me and my\nmission to deliver free high quality\ncontent to the world thank you for your\nhelp\nso what was the study about basically\nwhat these two guys did was they brought\nsome really sophisticated statistical\nmodels to bear on millions of data\npoints collected in four major markets\nover a one month period on a popular\ndating app\nthey don't mention what the app is but\nbased on some of the other features\nmentioned in the article I'm led to\nbelieve that it's probably Tinder\nthey also strangely didn't include a\nsample size however they do note that\nthe most popular person in that one\nmonth period received a total of 1 504\nmessages during that time and that's\njust one person in all of New York\nBoston Chicago and Seattle so very\nlikely we're talking about millions of\ndata points which would make the\nconclusions extremely robust now what\nthe researchers tried to do was to\nquantify desirability which it turns out\nis actually pretty hard to do for a\nnumber of reasons one is that men\napparently initiate contact over 80\npercent of the time so you can't simply\nuse who is being contacted as a metric\nof who is attractive as more desirable\nmen received more responses from women\nthan less desirable men so what they did\nis they constructed this really\ncomplicated Vector analysis that\nincluded data on the number and\ndirection of contacts and responses and\nbasically ranked everybody who used the\napp during that one month period in a\ngiven Market from least to most\nattractive\neverybody had a rank this also allowed\nthem to calculate the desirability gap\nbetween contact doors and contactees\nwhich in turn was factored into the\nanalysis this means that people were\nranked as more desirable not simply due\nto the fact that they got more messages\nor responses but if they got more\nmessages or responses from more\ndesirable potential partners\nit's actually a pretty nuanced and\nsophisticated algorithm these guys are\nclearly Big Data dorks and they were\nbringing their knowledge and expertise\nto bear on this really interesting\nproblem\nhere's one of the things that they\ndiscovered to make sure I get it right\nI'm just going to quote it directly from\nthe paper here we go\nonce we have our desirability scores we\ncan use them to identify characteristics\nof desirable users by comparing scores\nacross various user attributes as shown\nin figure 2 for instance average\ndesirability varies with age for both\nmen and women\nalthough it varies more strongly for\nwomen and the effects run in opposite\ndirections\nolder women are less desirable while\nolder men are more so for women this\npattern holds over the full range of\nAges on the site the average woman's\ndesirability drops from the time she is\n18 until she is 60.\nfor men desirability Peaks around 50 and\nthen declines\nend quote so what's the upshot here one\nway we can think about these results are\nas Peak normalized sexual Marketplace\nvalues apparently according to men a\nwoman is at her Peak sexual Marketplace\nvalue when she is 18 years old\nas determined not only by the amount of\nmale attention but by the quality of\nmale attention that she receives\non the other hand according to women a\nman is at his Peak sexual Marketplace\nvalue when he is 50 years old\nas determined not only by the amount of\nfemale attraction but by the quality of\nfemale attraction that he receives\npretty incredible huh\nthis is not an individual preference\nthis is data collected from hundreds of\nthousands of people of all ages and\nethnicities across millions of data\npoints data that were remarkably stable\nacross four different and independent\nlocations that makes the research\nextremely powerful\nI also really like this study because as\na psychologist I understand that there\nis a big difference between what people\nsay publicly and what people do\nprivately\nand this article is examining behavior\nthat is anonymous and private it shows\nus how men and women Express desire when\nthey think that no one else is looking\nso on some level results like this are a\nlot more trustworthy than the kind of\nresponses you tend to get when you ask\npeople directly what they're attracted\nto\nin the first place people don't always\nknow what they're attracted to and in\nthe second place they're public\nconscious reports are almost always\ndistorted by social desirability biases\nyou can listen to what people say but\nyou need to look for Behavioral\nconfirmation subsequent to that\ndisclosure so again according to this\nstudy two men women are most attractive\nat 18 and to women men are most\nattractive at 50. also while female\nperceived attractiveness Falls\nprecipitously over the lifespan male\nperceived attractiveness is fairly\nstable for about\n20 years from 40 to 60.\nI'm including an episode on this study\nto back up some of the responses I made\nto comments on my episode why men like\nyounger women\nhere's the data I was talking about it's\nnot just my personal opinion and my next\nepisode will take these results one step\nfurther to some fairly interesting\nconclusions so stay tuned what do you\nthink\nplease let me know in the comments below\nand thanks for listening"
