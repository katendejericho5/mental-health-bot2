    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nrespect means different things to men\nand women\nso I'm going to be presenting this idea\nin the context of some feedback that I\nfrequently receive from women both in\nreal life and on this very Channel I\noften hear them complaining about the\nfact that in their eyes it seems like\nmen\ndon't really know what to do with them\nthey don't seem to take the initiative\nthey don't seem to lead the relationship\nthey might seem awkward or inept at sex\nand seduction and they don't seem to\npursue women with any sort of real\npurpose I hear them say where are all\nthe men who know how to treat a woman\nit's a great question and I can\nunderstand from a female's perspective\nhow this would be a frustrating\nexperience so I'm here to help I've\ngiven it some thought and this episode\nis what I've come up with now before I\nexplain why this phenomenon might exist\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld thanks for your help oh and be\nsure to watch the end of the episode\nbecause I've saved the most important\nreason\nfor last\nnow back to it I think that this\nexperience of women can be attributed\nlargely though not entirely to different\ncomprehensions of the idea of respect\nrespect means something different to a\nman than to a woman and this is\nsomething that we haven't really\nappreciated as a culture because it may\ncreate unintended consequences such as\nthe ones that we're discussing when you\ntell men to respect women this is\nsomething we drill into boys from a very\nyoung age you have to respect women you\nhave to respect women\nbut respect might mean different things\nto men than it does to women let's look\ninto this further\nfirst of all let me make very clear that\nI'm not advocating that anyone should be\ntaught to disrespect women\nI'm not saying that that said if you\ndon't respect somebody it doesn't\nnecessarily mean that you're\ndisrespecting them for instance just\nbecause you're not giving me respect\ndoesn't mean that you're actively\ndisrespecting me you may just be feeling\nneutrally towards me and as I've said in\na previous episode it's always best if\npeople earn your respect and your\ndisrespect at the end of the day I think\nit might be a better idea to teach boys\nthat they shouldn't disrespect women\nthat would potentially create less of a\nproblem here so what's the issue\nthere are three actually and they relate\nto how men understand respect so what\ndoes respect mean to a man first respect\nmeans that I look up to you\nthere's an element of admiration to\nrespect\nit's not really possible to respect the\ncross and it's certainly not possible to\nrespect down remember we're not talking\nabout respect in the sense of basic\nhuman dignity men tend to associate\nrespect with admiration of Excellence\nso when a man respects a woman he puts\nher on a pedestal\nthis tends to create a lot of\ndifficulties in the courtship process\nthis is because it puts the woman in the\nposition of the adored and the Man in\nthe position of the adorer and this robs\nthe woman of the opportunity to have the\nmore emotional experience in the\nrelationship and if you want to know\nmore about these terms please check out\nmy series on the balance of Attraction\nlinks in the PIN to comment below\nwomen are generally more emotional than\nmen and so they prefer to go to\nrelationships to feel to have emotional\nexperiences and they're going to feel\nmuch more if they're in the position of\nthe Adora not in the position of the\nadored however they are put there when\nmen go out of their way to demonstrate\ntheir admiring respect so that's one\nunintended consequence that women might\nbe going out with these men who put them\non a pedestal which in turn prevents\nwomen from feeling much with respect to\nthese men\nsecond to the masculine mind respect\nmeans deference\nwhen you respect someone you tend to\ndefer to their judgment or expertise you\nultimately won't be making the decision\nbecause you acknowledge that the other\nperson might be in a position to know\nbetter deference means humble submission\ntell me what you want and I'll make it\nhappen\nthis might sound nice in theory but in\npractice it means that a man exercising\ndeference isn't going to be making plans\nsetting up dates making decisions or\ndriving the relationship he's going to\nbe deferring to what she wants to do\nbecause he's trying to show that he\nrespects her do you see\nand the third thing the final thing\nthat's tricky with respect to the\nmasculine mind the thing that exerts an\nenormous influence on the phenomenon\nwe're discussing here is that it's very\nvery difficult for respect\nand sexuality to coexist at the same\ntime\nthink about it in any situation where\nrespect is socially expected at\ngraduation a ceremony a funeral\nsex is completely inappropriate\nsexuality in these contexts would\nactually be disrespectful\nrespect is not arousing if anything it\nnullifies the sexual impulse men think\nthat they have to suppress their\nsexuality in order to be respectful\nbecause we would never express our\nsexuality in any other situation that\ncalls for respect\nbut the upshot here is that you can't\nreally respect someone\nand want to them at the same time\na man can respect his woman like as a\nperson but on some level he has to be\nable to turn that off in the bedroom in\norder to her\nit is what it is and this seems to be\ntrue from the woman's perspective as\nwell I mean correct me if I'm wrong but\nwhen a woman is sexually satisfied I\ndon't think her primary emotional\nexperience is that of feeling respected\nlike whoa oh you respected the out\nof me last night it's like\nthat's not typically how it works in the\nbedroom\nthis means that for men respect and\nassertive masculine sexuality are at\nodds with each other\nthis might not be a problem for women\nwhen it affects men that they're not\nattracted to in fact it's probably a\nbenefit to them however when it affects\nmen that they are attracted to it can\nleave them feeling confused frustrated\nand disappointed a man showing respect\nwill not also be showing sexual intent\nthe two are mutually exclusive in a\nman's mind\nso those are three ways that the idea of\nrespect might be tripping men up with\nrespect to dating women and why women\nmight experience a dearth of confident\ninitiative coming from Men in the sexual\nMarketplace\nI think that a better word to use here\nmight be consideration women want their\nfeelings and their preferences to be\ntaken into account but they typically\nstill want the man to initiate contact\nset up the date make the plans initiate\nsex be assertive and generally lead them\nin the direction of a desired\nrelationship\nconsideration influences but it does not\ndetermine what the man does and this\nconsideration can be expressed through\nself-initiated action\nhopefully that makes sense\nwhat do you think let me know in the\ncomments below and thank you for\nlistening"
