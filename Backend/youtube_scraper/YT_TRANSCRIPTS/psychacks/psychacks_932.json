    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology the\ntopic of today's short talk is the\nfundamental attribution error\nthe fundamental attribution error is a\nvery important cognitive bias shared by\nalmost all human beings that's why\npsychologists have termed it fundamental\nor the most basic or Universal\nattribution error or form of bias that\nthey've observed in people across\ncultures consequently it's important to\nunderstand what this is because it's\nalmost certainly operating in your life\nand probably to your detriment now\nbefore I explain this error please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second cost you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help\nso what is the fundamental attribution\nerror it's very simple it's basically\nthat I evaluate my successes character\nlogically and my failures contextually\nbut I evaluate other people's failures\ncharacterologically and their successes\ncontextually\nso those are a lot of big words\ntherefore let's make sure that we're on\nthe same page with a concrete example of\nthe error at work\nwhen I show up on time\nit's because I'm somebody who values\npunctuality but if I'm late\nit's because I was stuck in traffic\non the other hand if somebody else shows\nup on time it's because they're just\ndoing their job\nbut if they show up late it's because\nthey're disrespectful\nmake sense\ndo you see how this might create all\nkinds of nastiness and interpersonal\nrelationships\nin the fundamental attribution error we\nare basically giving ourselves the\nbenefit of the doubt and throwing other\npeople under the bus\nwe also tend to Rob others of their good\nqualities and think inappropriately\nhighly of ourselves\nnow it seems like this is the default\nmode of evaluation which is why it's the\nfundamental attribution error according\nto psychologists so we don't necessarily\nhave to beat ourselves up\nif we recognize this tenancy in\nourselves\nbut we can also work to overcome this\nbias as well it's not easy but it's\npossible and if you're interested the\nbest way to overcome this bias as a\nmental discipline is to consciously\nreverse the attribution\ngive other people the benefit of the\ndoubt and be harder and stricter with\nyourself\nthis creates generosity in interpersonal\nrelationships and this is generally well\nreceived it makes people like you more\nand by being harder and stricter with\nyourself you give yourself the\nopportunity to grow and develop as a\nperson with the right attitude you can\nsee your failings as an opportunity for\ngrowth over which you have some measure\nof control and responsibility\nthese failings become your growing Edge\nand in this way by consciously reversing\nthe bias you're constantly given fuel\nfor your own self-improvement and how is\nthat not to your benefit something to\nkeep in mind\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities thanks for\nlistening"
