    "transcript": "in my most recent episode exclusivity is\nexpensive I talk about two commonly\nmisunderstood concepts with respect to\nrelationships commitment and exclusivity\nthese do not mean the same thing it's\nsort of like squares and rectangles all\nexclusivity is commitment but not all\ncommitment is exclusive\nand to make this point clear I talk\nabout these ideas of commitment and\nexclusivity in the context of\nBusiness and Professional life because\nsometimes these concepts are just so\nmuch easier for folks to understand if\nwe take the emotion out of things\nbecause the underlying principles mostly\nremain the same and we can see that\nthey're not the same thing mostly\nbecause exclusivity is so much more\nvaluable and is therefore more expensive\nin any kind of relationship whether it's\nprofessional romantic and should be\nvalued appropriately check it out"
