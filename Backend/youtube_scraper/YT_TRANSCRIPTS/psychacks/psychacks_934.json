    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is\nexclusivity is expensive\nlet's get to it in the first place it's\nimportant to understand some of the\ndifferences between commitment and\nexclusivity it's like squares and\nrectals all exclusivity is a commitment\nbut not all commitment is exclusivity\nyou can think of commitment as a\npartnership this means that you're\ninvested it means that you care it means\nthat you are available it means that\nyou're willing to spend time and energy\nand resources if you do these things\nyou're in a committed relationship\nexclusivity means that in addition to\ndoing all of these things you're not\ndoing any of those with anyone else make\nsense now before I explain why\nexclusivity is so expensive please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second cost you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld thank you for listening\nnow the difference between commitment\nand exclusivity cannot be overstated and\nto help folks understand why this might\nbe the case\nI'm going to lateral from the Romantic\nsphere to the professional sphere\nbecause as I often say what works in one\noften works in the other\nlet's say that your company wanted to\nadvertise at the upcoming World Cup that\nis your company wanted to become a\npartner of the event to do this your\ncompany would enter into an agreement a\ncommitment with the folks who put on the\nevent in exchange for showing your\ncompany's advertising at the stadium or\nproviding a 30-second spot during\nhalftime your company is going to pay a\nsubstantial amount of money and that's\nthe deal you worked out it's a committed\npartnership in which ideally both\nPartners get what they want in the\nexchange\nbut let's say that your company wanted\nto be the exclusive partner of the World\nCup\ndo you have\nany idea how much more they would have\nto pay\nthe folks who put on the event would\ncounter that they could get ad revenue\nfrom like 50 other companies for this\none Stadium alone\nso if you wanted the spectators to see\nyour branding and your branding alone\nyou would probably have to buy out all\nthe other Billboards and AD spots that\nyou would otherwise that we would\notherwise sell to your competitors\nit'll be less work for us to just sell\nto you because we'd only have to manage\none contract versus 51 contracts so\nwe'll give you a discount but it's still\ngoing to cost you a lot exclusivity\nwould probably cost around 45x what\ncommitment would in the scenario\nand it would be Financial suicide for\nthe promoters to agree to anything less\nsince they could make so much more\nselling individual Partnerships do you\nunderstand\nnow let's lateral back to the Romantic\nsphere the basis of any relationship\nwhether it's personal or professional is\nthe mutual exchange of value\nand the amount of value being exchanged\ndictates the level of the relationship a\ncertain amount of value needs to be\nexchanged in order to have a committed\nrelationship but another level entirely\nmust be exchanged to have an exclusive\nrelationship at least if one of the\nparticipants isn't going to be\ncompletely hosed\nthis is something to keep in mind\nexclusivity is really expensive it's\nreally expensive and so if you're\ngunning for that level in your\nrelationship you have to be willing to\nprovide an exorbitant amount of value\nand value is always defined by the other\nparty remember the cat decides which\nmilk is good just keeping it real what\ndo you think remember to like comment\nand subscribe for the algorithm and see\nthe about tab for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities\nthanks for watching"
