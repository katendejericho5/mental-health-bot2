    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the truth\nabout romance solipsism\nthis is another one that's probably been\nstaring you in the face the entire time\nromance is fundamentally solipsistic and\nbecause this might be a unfamiliar term\nfor some of you let me first Define what\nthat is solipsism is the belief that\nnothing exists outside of the self\nconsequently we could also probably say\nthat romance is narcissistic but that\ncarries a whole host of other\nassociations that I don't want to get\ninto today now before I explain why\nromance is solipsistic please remember\nto like this video And subscribe to this\nchannel it costs you nothing takes only\na second and it's how you can support me\nin my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world thank you\nfor your help\nlike I've done in previous installments\nin this series I'm going to help you\nunderstand what I mean by directing you\nto a song in the pinned comment below I\nput a link to one of my favorite modern\nRomance songs Chasing Cars by Snow\nPatrol I love this song it's a great\nsong it has this delicious musicality\nthat starts simple and build to this\nglorious triumphant Crescendo which is\nmeant to represent the experience of\nmerging with the love object\nyou can definitely get wrapped up in\nthis song and you can also clearly see\nthe solipsistic nature of love in its\nlyrics\nas I argued in a previous episode\nromances for men romantic love was\nreally invented by lower status men for\nlower status men so that they might be\nable to compete with higher status men\nin the sexual Marketplace for women\nbecause they didn't have the resources\nand the status and the opportunity that\nmost women are looking for in their\nPartners they invented an intangible\nromantic love that they argued was even\nmore special and valuable than all of\nthat mere stuff\nit's kind of a spell that romantic\nlovers attempt to cast over their love\nobjects however it's a tenuous fragile\nspell that can really be broken at any\ntime\nso romantic love actually works only to\nthe extent that the Romantic lover\nsucceeds in drawing the love object away\nfrom anything that would remind her\nessentially that the emperor has no\nclothes\nlisten to the lyrics of this song\nwill do it all on our own we don't need\nanything or anyone would you lie with me\nand just forget the world\nforget what we're told let's waste time\nEtc\nI mean there are so many lyrics in this\nsong that suggests that the singer the\nRomantic protagonist is sort of\nattempting to draw the woman away from\nthe world into this little Universe of\ntwo where everything that we need is in\neach other's eyes forget about\neverything else look only at me\nit's a hypnotic spell\nwhose objective is to lure the love\nobject away from anything that could\nbreak the spell\nand the music helps that objective\nimmensely however the spell is\ncompletely broken if you just read the\nlyrics matter of factly divorced from\nthe smoke and mirrors that make them\nfeel emotionally true\nhere's a question for you if you were\nliving a great life if you had a lot of\nmeaningful relationships and fulfilling\nwork and an enjoyable lifestyle\nif you were successful in the broadest\npossible sense of the word\nwould you want to forget the world and\nleave it all behind\nof course not and the people who have\nthose things as a general rule don't\nwant to forego the lives that they've\nbuilt and that's also why they dispense\nwith romance they have tangible things\nthat people\nculturally want\nso they don't need intangible things\nthat they need to convince people they\nwant\nthis is why romance is generally a\nstrategy for those who can't compete\nsuccessfully in the world yet\na group that is overpopulated by young\nmen\nit's very very hard to be a young man in\nthis world let me tell you they're\nincompetent and inexperienced so men\ncan't do anything with them and they're\npoor and low status so women don't want\nanything with them no young man is the\nking\nand if they can't rule in the real world\none of their sexual strategies is to\nkind of hypnotize women with the fantasy\nof romantic love into following them out\nof the real world and into the universe\nof two\nwhere he can be king do you understand\nnow the goal of romance is solipsism\nbecause it's only in a universe of two\nthat is a universe without competition\nwhere the lower where the lover popper\ncan be king\nlet that sink in\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and remember to see the about\ntab for more information on donations\nconsultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for listening"
