    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhat straits can learn from gays so i'm\na straight man but i was a professional\nactor for 15 years and this meant a lot\nof my friends and colleagues were gay\nlesbian or just queer in general i\nlearned a lot about gay relationships\nduring that time today i want to\nhighlight one thing in particular that i\nthink straits can learn from gays with\nrespect to how to conduct relationships\nnow before i get into it please remember\nto like this video and subscribe to the\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me and my mission to deliver\nfree high quality content to the world\nso thank you for your help\none of the biggest issues with straight\nrelationships is that they operate under\nassumptive frameworks\ntwo straight people enter into a\nrelationship we're married we're\nboyfriend and girlfriend whatever\nand both people generally assume\nthat they have the same idea with\nrespect to what that means\nthey think they both understand the same\nthing when they use words like marriage\ncommitment monogamy and partnership\nthis is the assumptive framework it's an\namalgamation of archetypes from their\nown families of origin\ntraditional culture and visible models\nin a larger society\nhowever\ngays just don't have this framework\nthere is no archetypal model for gay\nrelationships until 40 or 50 years ago\nit was socially unacceptable in\nalmost every part of the world to even\ncome out as gay so there aren't visible\ntraditions or public archetypes for gay\nrelationships for the individuals to\nfall back on\nin the vast majority of cases gay folks\ncan't even look to their own parents and\ntheir families of origin to see models\nfor what a healthy gay relationship is\nsupposed to look like do you get what\ni'm saying\nso when gay folks get together they have\nto like explicitly negotiate\neverything\nnothing is assumed it's like\ndo we tell our parents do we tell our\nfriends which friends what do we tell\nthem is this an open relationship if it\nis what's allowed what's not allowed who\ncan do what with whom when do we want a\nfamily do we want to adopt or use a\nsurrogate do we get married or have a\ncivil union or simply live together as\npartners who's on top who's on bottom do\nwe switch\nevery aspect of sex relationship and\ncommitment needs to be explicitly\ndiscussed because there is no assumptive\nframework to fall back on and gays\nbeing already outside the mainstream in\nsome respects are also generally more\nopen to unconventional approaches to all\nof these issues as a result\ngay relationships have the potential to\nbe more closely aligned with the actual\nneeds and values of the individuals\ninvolved on the other hand because of\nthe assumptive framework there's a lot\nof potential for misunderstanding and\nstraight relationships what's more you\nmight have two people trying to fit\nthemselves into an archetypal idea\nthat predates both of their lives and\nmay not actually be good fits for either\none of them\nhowever there is a lot of social\npressure to accord with traditional\nrelationship models\ngays by virtue of the fact that they've\nalready broken with tradition in at\nleast one other significant way\ncan be more practiced in resisting this\npressure than straits and more willing\nto find idiosyncratic solutions to their\nproblems\nsomething to consider\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities thanks for\nlistening"
