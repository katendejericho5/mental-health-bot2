    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why most\nrelationships don't last\nthis episode is specifically directed to\nfolks out there who are looking for a\nlong-term relationship but seem to be\nhaving trouble getting past the six\nmonth Mark you get involved with someone\nyou like things seem to be going well\nbut then a few months in the\nrelationship Peters out you go your\nseparate ways why might this be the case\nnow before I answer this question please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it costs you\nnothing takes only a second and it's how\nyou can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help\nthe reason why most relationships don't\nlast why most relationships do not get\npast the sixth month mark\nis the crisis of disillusionment\nlet me explain what this is\nin the beginning\nall relationships are fundamentally\nprojected fantasy in the vast majority\nof cases you don't actually know who\nthis other person is you've spent a few\ndays or even just a few hours together\ngleaned a little information and filled\nthe gaps in your knowledge base in with\nwhat you would like to find there and\nthis is true almost in direct proportion\nto the degree to which you are attracted\nto the other person the more attracted\nyou are the more likely you're going to\nfill in the gaps in your knowledge base\nwith positive attributes this is called\nthe halo effect\nthis means that if you think she's\nreally hot you're off and you have no\nother evidence to the contrary you're\nalso liable to believe that she's kind\nand smart and sexy and interested in you\nand all the things that you would like\nto see in this other person and if you\nthink he's really handsome you're liable\nto filling the gaps in your knowledge\nbase with the projection that he's also\ncommitted and kind and family oriented\nand exciting and generous and all the\nthings that you might be looking for in\na partner you understand\nnow in the first few months while people\nare generally still projecting their\nfantasies they will also work to protect\ntheir fantasies\nthey see signs that things might not be\nwhat they appear to be but because they\nprefer the fantasy to which they are\nattracted they tend to rationalize and\nminimize these signs early on in the\ncourtship this is why people will so\noften ignore even obvious red flags when\nthey are very attracted to another\nperson\nbut here's the thing\nit eventually happens that a\npreponderance of evidence accumulates or\nan unavoidable manifestation of evidence\nto the contrary presents itself\nand the projected fantasy can no longer\nsustain the assault of reality\nthis is the crisis of disillusionment at\nthis point the fantasy is shattered the\nspell is broken and you begin to see\nwith Clear Eyes the person who's\nactually standing in front of you now\nthis probably doesn't mean that this\nperson is bad or evil or that this\nperson wouldn't be a good partner for\nyou all things considered but it is a\nkind of fall because no one will be able\nto live up to your projected fantasy of\nan ideal partner\nand this can be very disappointing and\ndemoralizing for folks especially those\nwho are most interested in limerence the\nfeeling of being in love\nand who are chasing the Romantic ideal\nof love and partnership\nthese folks really can't sustain this\ncrisis but all relationships have to\npass through the crisis of\ndisillusionment at some point or another\nand the question at this point becomes\nokay now that we kind of know more about\nwho we actually are and what we're\nactually dealing with\nis there enough left for us to build a\nrelationship upon in reality and there\nmight be and there might not be but this\nis when the work of building a shared\nvision of the future actually begins\neverything up to the crisis of\ndisillusionment is really just a Prelude\nto the actual relationship\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for letting thanks for listening\nbye"
