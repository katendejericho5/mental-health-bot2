    "transcript": "the majority of American marriages are\nsexless and those are just the ones that\nlast by which I mean how many otherwise\nhealthy and supportive relationships are\nended every year because of sexual\nproblems\nand difficulties we have this\nprudishness in our culture about sex\nthat's very paradoxical in in terms of\nromantic relationships we generally\nthink that it's a superficial thing that\nit's less important than some of the\nother dimensions of romantic love\nand therefore\nsometimes we should just suffer through\nand I think that causes a lot of\nunnecessary suffering the traditional\nmarriage vows after all tell us that our\nspouse is to have and to hold and I\ndon't mean\nhands so if you'd like to know more\nabout this please see my recent episode\nthe importance of sex in a relationship\nthank you"
