    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why nice\nguys finish last so this will be a\ncontinuation of my previous episode\nentitled women want it all so if you\nhaven't watched that already you should\nstart there in that episode I discussed\nhow according to the research while\nattractive women want everything they\ndon't want everything equally and\napparently among the attributes they are\nmost willing to dispense with in their\npotential partners are intelligence\nloyalty and kindness today I'm going to\nexplain why nice guys smart loyal and\nkind guys finish last or which is really\njust the other side of the same coin why\nwomen love now it's not\nactually true that women love\nbut I'm going to explain how this belief\noriginated using conclusions from the\nresearch but before I do so please\nremember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel takes less than\na second it costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so really thanks for your help\nso\nguys I'm gonna help you understand why\nit's not actually true that women love\n to do this let's entertain a\nlittle thought experiment let's say you\ncould work at two different companies\nokay at one company you would have this\nreally awesome boss\nlike the boss really cares about you\nsupports your goals invests in advancing\nyour career understands when you need to\ntake time off and values your\nperspective I mean this boss has all the\nbest intangibles okay so that's one\npossibility\nhowever at the other company\nyou would have a boss who frankly\ndoesn't give a about your dreams\nand your goals and is really just\ninterested in using you for the labor\nthat you can provide\nbut he pays you three times as much\ngives you unlimited time off and offers\nan amazing benefit package\nwhich company are you going to work for\nthe vast majority of folks are going to\nbe willing to put up with this boss not\ncaring about them if they got everything\nelse they wanted for the job\nthey're not choosing the job because the\nboss is an\nthey're choosing the job because the\nsalary and benefits are best\nthe fact the boss there just happens to\nbe an is incidental\nI hope this is starting to make sense\nokay so by their own admission women are\nnot prioritizing kindness loyalty and\nintelligence in their search for a\npartner just like you're probably not\ngoing to prioritize say a company's\nmission statement in your search for the\njob it would be great\nif you aligned in that respect but it's\nnot going to be your highest or even one\nof your highest priorities\nwomen are going to go with the most\nattractive compensation package and it's\nfor them to decide what constitutes the\nmost attractive compensation packages\nultimately this means they typically end\nup at the high paying second company\nand what happens to the bosses at the\nfirst companies around the world these\nbosses can't offer a competitive package\nbased on what women actually value this\nmeans they can't compete in the looks\ndepartment they can't compete in the\nincome department they can't compete in\nthe provision department they can't\ncompete in the emotional connection\nDepartment\nso what do they do they focus on the few\ndepartments in which they can compete\nsuccessfully with the second boss in an\neffort to feel superior to the men that\nthe women actually choose as a means of\nassuaging their egos\nand what are some of these departments I\ndon't know maybe\nkindness intelligence and loyalty\nyou know nice guy traits\nhowever if we actually take the results\nof this study at face value women don't\ncare about these things nearly as much\nas they care about other things my dude\nit is what it is the idea that women are\nchoosing men who are is really\na consequence of an unwillingness to\nlook at why women actually choose men\nwithout judgment or moralizing they're\nnot choosing my friend they're\nchoosing good looking High earning\ninteresting and exciting lifestyle\nproviders\nand if they happen to be loyal and\nintelligent even better but they're not\nactually sorting for those things\nprimarily do you understand fighting\nagainst this constitutes a failure to\nlook at the way things actually are when\npeople do this they move further and\nfurther away from reality making it less\nlikely that they're going to get what\nthey want hopefully that clears a few\nthings up\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities thanks for\nyour help"
