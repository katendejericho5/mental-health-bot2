    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwomen want it all\nso the title of this episode is actually\na riff on one of my all-time favorite\npsychology research papers entitled\nattractive women want it all it appeared\nin the journal evolutionary psychology\nin 2008 volume 6 issue 1 in case you\nwant to look it up and I love this paper\nbecause it's like the Nerds and academic\npsychology finally researched a question\nthat the average guy both didn't already\nknow the answer to and really wanted to\nknow the answer to namely\nthe question of what women wanted now\nbefore I unpack This research which is\nvery surprising please remember to like\nthis video And subscribe to the channel\nit takes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nin my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world so thank\nyou for your help so what happened in\nthis study basically the researchers\nstarted by asking about a hundred guys\nto write a whole bunch of women in terms\nof their attractiveness their face their\nbody and their overall appearance and\nthe women invited to participate in the\nstudy were the ones that the men rated\nmost highly the researchers then sent\nthese really involved surveys to the\nwomen deemed most attractive by the men\nand the surveys functionally asked in a\nhundred different ways ladies what do\nyou want do you want a handsome man do\nyou want a rich man do you want a family\nman do you want an emotionally available\nman do you want a committed man what do\nyou want\nand how did the women respond\nthe women basically responded with a\nsingle word\nyes\nit turns out that attractive women\nwanted\nevery single thing on the list and this\nwas surprising to the researchers the\nwomen looked at all of these qualities\nand attributes and collectively said\nyeah sounds good I'll take it\nit's a fascinating study because I think\nit's very honest but here's the really\ninteresting part while the women\napparently wanted it all they didn't\nwant everything equally\nthe women expressed a positive desire\nfor all the attributes across like two\ndozen different categories however some\npreferences were much stronger than\nothers and according to the study the\nthree categories that the women cared\nthe least about do you know what they\nwere you're gonna love this\nthat he be intelligent\nthat he be loyal\nand that he be kind and understanding\nthe women would prefer to have those\nthings than not but those three things\nactually weren't even statistically\nsignificant according to the researchers\nanalyzes intelligence loyalty and\nkindness of the nearly two dozen things\nthat attracted women want in a man these\nwere apparently the three attributes\nthey could most readily dispense with so\nwhat's the upshot if you're taking the\nstudy at face value it means men\nif you want to be a viable option for\nvery attractive women you need to listen\nto what these women actually value\nif you're putting a lot of energy into\nyour intelligence your loyalty and your\nkindness especially if doing so detracts\nfrom other higher value attributes like\nbeing physically fit earning a lot of\nmoney providing a house Etc\nyou're probably not gonna be picked for\nDodgeball\nyou got me\nI'll continue this talk in my next\nepisode so stay tuned what do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for listening"
