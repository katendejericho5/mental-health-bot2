    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is neglected\nkinds of love\norder so I was recently inspired to\nbegin a series of episodes in which I\nexamine the concept of love from a less\nconventional perspective but to most\npeople associate with the concept of\nLove well love is patient love is kind\nlove is a warm fuzzy feeling in our\nhearts Etc I think you can make an\nargument that love can be those things\nhowever I see love in a slightly\ndifferent way and before I explain what\nthat is please remember to like\nAnd subscribe to this channel it takes\nless than a second costs you nothing and\nit's how you can support me in my\nmission to deliver free high quality\ncontent to the world\nthank you for your help\nnow for me my template for love is a\nspiritual template and I try to look at\nthe way that God exists in relation to\nthe created Universe for Clarity on what\nlove is because if we assume that the\nhigher power is omnibenevolent that is\nthat he is all good and all loving then\nwe should be able to see in the way the\nhigher power relates to the created\nUniverse attributes of that love\nand in many respects when you examine\nlove from this perspective you don't\nactually see some of the things that I\nmentioned at the beginning of this\nepisode and other attributes come to the\nForefront and one such attribute that\nI'd like to emphasize today is order\nif anything love is often associated\nwith disorder it's like this Whirlwind\nthat sweeps into people's lives and\nturns everything upside down\nhowever it's interesting to note that in\nGreek mythology Eros the god of love was\nthe son of chaos the god of primordial\ndisorder\nthis suggests that out of chaos comes\nlove\nand we can see that in the created\nUniverse just look around\nwhat can the ordering principle be that\ncan take the dissolute and disparate\nelements of the universe and combine\nthem in such a way that life can be\nsustained what can the principle that\nfundamentally makes life possible be\nif not love\nlife let alone the things that make life\nworth living cannot exist in a chaotic\nenvironment to create order out of chaos\nto put things in their proper place to\nassign actions to their proper season to\napproach process in the correct sequence\nthese are all examples of how order can\nbe an aspect of love\nand we can certainly see that in the\ncreated Universe we see that in how\nnight is separated from day and how the\nseasons progress in their orderly\nsequence and how our bodies are\norganized and how water flows down and\nfire flares up and it's within the\ncontext of this order that life becomes\npossible and that goodness and\nprosperity are allowed to flourish so\norder in my opinion is a neglected form\nof love that deserves far more\nacknowledgment and appreciation than it\ncurrently gets hopefully that makes\nsense to you what do you think please\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and see the about tab\nfor more information on donations\nconsultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for your help"
