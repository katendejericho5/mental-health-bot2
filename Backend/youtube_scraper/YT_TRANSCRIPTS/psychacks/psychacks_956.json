    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is why\npre-screening dates is a bad idea\nso this episode is for the women out\nthere who are using online dating apps\nto try to enter into relationships with\nmen\nwhat am I talking about let's say you've\nmatched with a guy you've bantered back\nand forth and he asks you out on a date\npre-screening is when the woman\ninterrupts this process to further\nqualify the man for the date by for\nexample asking the notoriously bad\nquestion what are you looking for or\ninsisting on a zoom call First now\nbefore I explain why this is a bad idea\nand you will want to watch to the end of\nthe episode here please remember to like\nthis video And subscribe to the channel\nit takes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nand my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world so thank\nyou for your help\nso ladies I understand the impulse to\npre-screened dates after you match with\nmen because you're not interested in\nwasting your time you don't want to go\non a bunch of dates that lead nowhere\nthough that is sort of the nature of the\ngame and you want to be more selective\nwith respect to whom you spend your time\nwith to do this it makes a kind of sense\nto ask a bunch of direct questions\nhowever in reality this doesn't actually\nachieve this goal for a number of\nreasons in the first place\nyou're very unlikely to get honest\nanswers to your questions\nguys understand that there are right and\nwrong answers to these questions and\nthey're probably not going to talk\nthemselves out of an opportunity you\nmight think this is dishonest but this\nis what people do as a means of\ncomparison let's assume that you're in\nthe market for a job in the initial\ninterview the recruiter might ask if\nyou're willing to do some things that\nyou might not really want to do however\nyou might understand that these things\ncould be more negotiable once you enter\ninto the relationship or at least have\nmore leverage in the process which is\nactually a very reasonable expectation\nhowever since you know that you'll never\nget to that point if you don't give the\nright answer now you're gonna say what\nyou're gonna say to keep the opportunity\nalive for the time being the earlier and\nmore rigid the filtering process the\nmore likely this will occur next in the\nsecond place I would argue that\npre-screening dates probably won't work\nwith the type of men you're most\ninterested in dating here's why we know\nfrom the research that women are\nextremely selective about the men that\nthey swipe right on according to the\ndata about 15 percent of men on apps\nreceive over 80 percent of the female\nlikes this is far more selective than\nmen who tend to be more generous about\nwho they're willing to give a shot to in\nany case this means that as a woman the\nguys that you are liking are almost\ncertainly being liked by an enormous\nnumber of women\nso by virtue of the fact that you like\nthem you should probably assume that\nthey have lots of options\nso let's see the pre-screening test from\nthe perspective of one of these guys\nlet's say he has two equally good\noptions\num the however one\nenthusiastically accepts his invitation\nto go out on a date\nwhile the other apparently wants to\ninterview him to see if he's good enough\nto be afforded the privilege of buying\nher a drink\nwhich girly think he's going to take out\nnow instead of two options imagine he\nhas 200.\ndo you get what I'm saying attempting to\npre-screen a date generally disqualifies\nyou from dating the kinds of guys you\nmight actually want which are the kinds\nof guys that most women want\nwhich brings us to our third\nconsideration\nby pre-screening your dates you are\neffectively taking control of the\ncourtship process rather than following\nthe man's lead who's attempting to set\nup a date with you you're asking him to\nfollow you in a different direction to\ngive you the answers you want to hear\nand to obey whatever pre-existing rules\nyou might have about how this is\nsupposed to go\nwhat kind of guy is actually going to go\nalong with that like high value Alpha\nmen with lots of options\nthose guys are not going to enter your\nframe and follow your lead and obey your\nrules so when you pre-screen men in this\nway who do you actually succeed in\nscreening out\nyou'll probably end up talking to the\nmen with fewer options who have time on\ntheir hands\nnow I'm not arguing that you should be\nwasting your time I'm not arguing that\nyou should be going out with men that\nyou're not attracted to or from whom you\ndon't believe that you can get what you\nwant ideally both people get what they\nwant That's the basis of a relationship\nbut there are ways of going about the\nscreening more indirectly more subtly\nand frankly more effectively 99 times\nout of 100 you're going to get much\nbetter information if you actually show\nup on the date it takes an hour of your\ntime but you'll probably get a drink out\nof it if you actually want a\nrelationship you need to get off the\napps as quickly as possible\nwhat do you think please remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and see the about tab for
