    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion terban and this is psyx\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is romance\nis a game of hide and seek so this is\nanother episode in my truth about\nromance Series in today's episode I'm\ngoing to explain the fundamental game of\nromantic relationships and exactly how\nit\noperates as the title suggests the\nfundamental game at the heart of\nromantic relationships is hideand-seek\nit's very simple it kind of works like\nthis first I am going to cut out a part\nof myself and then I'm going to hide\nthat part of myself in somewhat of my\nchoosing and then I'm going to forget\nabout the cutting and the hiding and the\nchoosing the forgetting is actually a\nvery important part of all this because\nas we'll see becoming increasingly aware\nof this mechanism of action ruins the\nentire game after all if you're going to\nhave any fun seeking you can't already\nknow where you've hidden the thing that\nyou're looking for now can you but those\nare the rules that's how you play\nthere's the cutting and the hiding and\nthe choosing and the forgetting let's go\nthrough each step first the cutting the\nidea here is to repress awareness of\ncertain aspects of the self so that we\nare no longer in emotional contact with\nthose parts of ourselves it's not that\nthey're actually removed we didn't\nreally cut them out we just kind of\ncan't see them or feel them inside of\nourselves for a while so we kind of\nassume that they're not there now people\ndo this all the time I've talked several\ntimes on this channel about the\nmechanism of evil whereby people disavow\nthe shameful and unacceptable parts of\nthemselves project them onto others and\nthen attempt to cleanse the world of\ntheir own darkness by destroying the\nobject onto which that Darkness was\nprojected this is the source of the vast\nmajority of unnecessary suffering on\nthis planet Roman on the other hand\nWorks a little differently rather than\ncut off contact with the unacceptable\nparts of themselves Romantics actually\ncut out some of the most acceptable and\nrespectable and ennobling parts of\nthemselves and then project those parts\ninto others these are the parts that are\nbeautiful and good and kind even the\nparts that recognize the share of\ndivinity we all partake in as human\nbeings these parts are cut off and\nhidden in somebody else hidden in\nsomebody that they can now very\nliterally call my\nlove of course this creates a liability\nfor Romantics as long as they are cut\noff from these parts of themselves\nthey're going to feel less than whole\nincomplete even broken a fragment of\nwhat they could otherwise be and love in\ntheir imaginations will remain a kind of\nMythic Alchemy whereby the fractured\nself is finally healed and made whole\nand they're going to seek that wholeness\nin in reunion with the person on whom\nthey have projected these disavowed\nparts of\nthemselves now if Romantics were to go\nthrough all this trouble you would think\nthat they would at least choose to hide\nthese disavowed parts of themselves in\nsummon with whom they would be likely to\nunite but if you still think this you\ndon't yet understand the point of the\ngame which I'll get to in a moment in\npoint of fact Romantics seem to do their\ndarnest to hide these parts of\nthemselves\nin the last people with whom they could\nreasonably hope to\nunite and this happens too often to be\nmere coincidence people often say that\nattraction isn't a choice that\ntechnically isn't entirely true because\nthis whole game doesn't progress at\nrandom or by accident it's probably more\naccurate to say that attraction isn't a\nconscious Choice people aren't simply\nthe innocent victims of Cupid's driveby\nthey're generally more involved in the\nprocess than they might think now before\nI go any further if you're liking what\nyou're hearing then please consider\nsending this episode to someone

an\ninquiry form on my website if you're\ninterested in booking a paid\nconsultation links to everything in the\ndescription let's get back to\nit now Romantics tend to choose to hide\nthese parts of themselves in people with\nwhom for whatever reason it would\nactually be fairly difficult to connect\nmaybe they're just in from out of town\nfor the weekend or they're already in a\nrelationship with somebody else or\nthey're way out of their league Etc and\nthe reason for this is kind of\ncounterintuitive but here it is\nRomantics don't don't actually want to\nget what they\nwant after all to the extent that I'm\nright the easiest way for them to get\nwhat they want would be to become\nincreasingly aware that they had it the\nentire time and that this complicated\nrigar roll is completely unnecessary and\nthey don't want this for several\nsignificant reasons first ever wonder\nwhy people in emotionally s Ying\nrelationships or with full and\ninteresting lives in which they are\ncultivating meaning and purpose don't\nseem to fall in\nlove it's not a coincidence that people\ntend to fall in love when they're\ndissatisfied with their careers or\nthey're in an unsatisfying relationship\nor no relationship at all or they're\nkind of lost or coasting through life\nthere are certain conditions under which\na game of hideand-seek becomes more\nappropriate this is not merely a\ndiversion from boredom or a distraction\nfrom the misery of existence though of\ncourse it can be it's a way of\nmotivating action how well if you're\nunsatisfied with your life then you kind\nof need to hide what good you possess\nsomewhere else as this will motivate you\nto leave an unfulfilling situation and\nseek out that goodness elsewhere and\nthis kind of makes sense like it\nwouldn't be motivating to project the\nbad things out out there that's not\ngoing to motivate anyone to seek them\nout the game of romance is functionally\ncasting out a line that you've baited\nwith certain disavowed positive aspects\nof yourself so that you might catch\nyourself in a different location you'll\ncatch yourself in a different location\nbecause you've baited your lure with\nsomething that you want and you've cast\nyour line out beyond your present\ncircumstances at least in theory you\nhave however as stated previously\nRomantics don't actually want to catch\nthemselves because that would bring the\nwhole game to a close and they would\nfunctionally need to stay where they are\nand build with what they have and this\ncan be a bitter pill to swallow because\npeople are\ndisappointing and life can be tedious\nwearisome and\nhard there is Adventure in seeking there\nis no Adventure in finding\ngetting what they want would effectively\nend the game for Romantics and eliminate\nthe possibility that somewhere out there\nthere's a better life waiting for them\ncontending with hopelessness is not\nsomething humans typically do very well\nin any case Romantics want to get what\nthey want about as much as they want to\nbecome aware of this whole process\nthat's why the game has to be hidden so\ndeeply in order for it to be playable\njust like you can't really tickle\nyourself Romantics have to feel as if\nthose parts of themselves really do\ninhere in external reality in order to\nfeel something otherwise what's the\npoint this is why people are not only in\ndenial about this process but they are\noften willfully in denial about this\nprocess and will fight tooth and nail\nagainst anyone who threatens to bring\nthis to their awareness romantic love is\na very cherished golden calf\nhowever the truth is that you can't\nactually reunite with the disavowed\nparts of yourself by entering into a\nromantic relationship with another\nperson that's the truth you can only do\nthat by preventing the disavowal of\nthose parts to begin with Romantics have\nbeen whole the entire\ntime they only feel incomplete and\nseparate in their own perceptual\nexperience as a consequence of this\ndisavow to become whole\npeople don't need a relationship people\nneed to wake up to their own essential\nwholeness and heal from whatever\nemotional wound caus the self to become\nfractured in the first place this is\ntypically not as exciting as the game of\nhide-and-seek but trust me it is far\nmore rewarding what do you think does\nthis fit
