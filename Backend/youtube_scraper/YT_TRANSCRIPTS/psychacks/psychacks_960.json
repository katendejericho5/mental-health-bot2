    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women\npunish the men they like\nso ladies this is an episode for you I'm\ngoing to explain how you might be\nmessing up in your relationships with\nmen this is going to be bitter medicine\nfor some of you but if you take it in\nthe right Spirit it might actually\nsignificantly improve your relationships\nnow before I explain what I mean by this\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second costs you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thank you for your help now in\norder to illustrate how women punish the\nmen they like let's consider a little\nthought experiment let's say you have\ntwo men in your life one guy you could\nkind of take her leave he's decent he's\nokay to have some fun with every once in\na while but you're not that emotionally\ninvested in him and the other guy well\nyou really like he's handsome charming\nmakes you laugh treats you well and\nseems to have good potential the more\nyou like him the more you envision a\nfuture with him and the more emotionally\ninvested you become so two guys now\nwhich of these two men are you going to\nbe annoyed at if he doesn't text you\nback right away\nwhich of these two men are you going to\nget jealous of if he spends time with\nother women\nwhich of these two men are you going to\npester if he's not showing sufficient\nenthusiasm and doing what you want\ndo you get what I'm saying the second\nguy whoever he is apparently has been\nable to successfully attract you and\nengage your emotions and as a\nconsequence of that he increasingly\nbecomes the target of your negative\nemotions\nif this guy doesn't feel like he's\ngetting the same slack and\npermissiveness that you would give to\nthe guy you don't give a about he's\nnot going to stick around if he has any\ndecent optionality\nand that's how your attraction drives\ngood men out of your lives\nnow I'm not saying you have to put up\nwith bad behavior\nwhat I'm saying is that Emotions Don't\nChange the definition of bad behavior\ngood or bad right or wrong is determined\nby the explicitly negotiated agreement\nof the relationship or by some\noverarching morality that both parties\nvoluntarily subscribe to not by how you\nfeel about the person involved murder is\nno less of a crime if no one liked the\nperson who was killed and it's not more\nof a crime if everyone loved the\ndeceased do you understand so I'm going\nto give you a good litmus test to help\nyou determine whether your negative\nemotion is Justified when a man you like\nhas done something you don't\nthe test is simple if another guy that\nyou didn't care about did the same thing\nwould you be angry or upset\nif no then maybe this guy hasn't done\nanything wrong\nif the guy you could take or leave\ndoesn't text you back for a few days\ndon't get all up in arms if and when the\nguy you like does the same thing\nabsenting some explicit expectation to\nthe contrary\nif the guy you could take or leave dates\nother women when you're not around\ndon't make a big deal about it if and\nwhen the guy you like does the same\nthing absenting some explicit\nexpectation to the contrary\nthis is your emotion talking and you\nneed to find a way to work through that\nyourself because if you punish men as a\nconsequence of your attraction to them\nyour disincentivizing them to be\nattractive to you just keeping it a buck\nwhat do you think remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
