    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living Through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nthe two body problem\nnow this episode will be a continuation\nof my previous episode entitled women\nhave more options in the sexual\nMarketplace which is in turn a\ncontinuation of an even earlier episode\nentitled what is the sexual Marketplace\nso be sure to start with these before\nlistening to this talk\nin the women have more options in the\nsexual Marketplace episode I argued that\nwomen now have two good options down at\nthe dock they can either enlist as a\npassenger or they can build their own\nships whereas men only still have one\nthey need to build the boat I ended that\nepisode by alluding to the fact that\nthis new optionality for women both\nsolved some problems and creates new\nones this episode will be about one of\nthe biggest of these newly created\nproblems it's called the two body\nproblem now before I explain what this\nis please remember to like this video\nAnd subscribe to this channel it takes\nless than a second it costs you nothing\nand it's how you can support me in my\nmission to deliver free high quality\ncontent to the world so thank you for\nyour help\nnow what is the two body problem the two\nbody problem is the name given to a type\nof relationship problem that is not\nuncommon in graduate programs let's say\nyou're foolish enough to try to earn a\nPhD\nbecause it's such an intense and\nisolating experience if you're single\ngoing into the program it's often the\ncase that you'll end up entering into a\nrelationship with another grad student\nin your program happens all the time now\nafter many years of sacrifice and\nstruggle let's assume the two\nindividuals succeed in graduating with\ntheir doctorates and are now entering\nthe job market for academic positions\ngiven the scarcity of Supply relative to\ndemand and the insane competitiveness\nfor what Supply does exist\nwhat do you think the odds are of both\nof these lovebirds receiving\nappointments at the same University\nfunctionally zero\nhell their offers might not even be\nwithin a thousand miles of each other\nso why is this a problem because it\nforces the individuals in question to\nchoose between their careers and their\nrelationship\nand what's the likelihood that either\none of them is going to walk away from\nan opportunity they devoted the last 10\nyears of their lives to creating\nthis isn't walking away from a job\nit's walking away from a decade of\ndeferred gratification bought with Blood\nSweat and Tears do you see\nin this case neither one is likely to be\nwilling to walk away for the other when\nshe worked just as hard as he did and\nvice versa\nso what does this have to do with the\nsexual Marketplace\ndo you know how long it takes to become\na good captain\nto build a boat\nlearn to sail and plot a course\nit can take decades\nthe more time you invest in the process\nof becoming a captain the less likely\nyou will ever be to abandon that process\nfor another person's preference\nthat's just the way it is\nand this means that if a woman chooses\nto be her own Captain if she Parks her\nship at the dock like all the other\ncaptains she'll be competing for the\nattention of the male passengers not the\nmale captains the men who have devoted\nDecades of their lives to building their\nown boats will never walk away from\ntheir vessels to be the passenger on a\nwoman's boat just because she learned\nhow to sail\nthe female captains will therefore need\nto content themselves with attracting\nthe attention of men who for whatever\nreason didn't succeed in becoming\ncaptains themselves\ntheir preferences may not be among their\navailable options and this is why a lot\nof successful women today complain that\nthere's just no good men out there yeah\nthe captains are presumably just as\ninterested in getting on their ship as\nsuccessful women are interested in\ngetting on theirs the two-body problem\nand the proposed solutions to this\nproblem are always some weird compromise\nlike well why don't the captains take\nturns piloting the same ship or why\ndon't they just sail in their own ships\nseparately to the same destination\nneither of which you ever see\nimplemented in any kind of paid\nEnterprise\nbecause they are inefficient and\nineffective they also serve to make the\ncaptains slightly less Captain e which\nis not really why a person goes through\nthe trouble of becoming one\nso here's the two body problem created\nby women's increased optionality in the\nsexual Marketplace when the rubber meets\nthe road\nwho is going to give up their command\nthe more you invest in your captainship\nthe harder it becomes to walk away what\ndo you think please remember to like\ncomment and subscribe for the algorithm\nand see the about tab for more\ninformation on donations consultations\nand sponsorship opportunities\nthanks for listening"
