    "transcript": "on my episode the nature of evil in\ngames DC asked how do you identify\nmalicious people this is a great\nquestion unfortunately there isn't a\nvery\nsimple answer the fact the matter is is\nthat a small minority of folks out there\nare predators and they are truly\nmalevolent and malicious and those\npredators that small percentage of\npeople actually account for the vast\nmajority of really bad behavior that\nexists in the world and it can be very\ndifficult to identify these malicious\npeople especially with a very small\nsample however not to leave you too\nempty-handed you kind of want to look\nout for\nhow they treat others when it seems like\nyou are not watching that's the key A\nlot of these predators are very good\nabout blending in and Optics so you want\nto kind of find ways to observe them\nwhen they don't feel like they're being\nobserved"
