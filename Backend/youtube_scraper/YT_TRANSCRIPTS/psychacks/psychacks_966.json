    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks Better Living jury psychology and\nthe topic of today's short talk is women\nhave more options in the sexual\nMarketplace\nthis is a follow-up to an episode I\nreleased a few weeks ago called what is\nthe sexual Marketplace so I would\nencourage you to listen to that one\nfirst if you haven't done so already\nin short I describe the sexual\nMarketplace as a sort of dock or peer\nwhere the men go to build a ship learn\nto sail and plot a course and where\nwomen go to examine the quarters test\nhis ability and review his manifest if\nboth the captain and the passenger agree\nthe two can get on with the voyage and\nthis is true to a point but it is in\nfact a partial explanation now before I\nexplain why this is a partial\nexplanation please remember to like this\nvideo And subscribe to the channel it\ntakes less than a second costs you\nnothing and it's how you can support me\nand my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world so thanks\nfor your help\nnow here's the thing the fact of the\nmatter is that women don't have to be\npassengers\nthat might have been true 100 years ago\nbut it's certainly not true today in\nfact women are supported encouraged and\nin many respects incentivized to to\nbecome their own captains\nto build ships learn to sail and plot a\ncourse\nI'm not saying this is good or bad it is\nwhat it is\nand I can certainly understand why women\nmight want this as a man I would never\nwant to be a passenger on somebody\nelse's ship it just goes against my very\nnature like the core of my being\nfurthermore I can appreciate that in\nsome parts of the world there aren't\nthat many good captains and I would much\nrather strike my own path than get on a\nrickety boat that isn't going to go\nwhere I want it to go anyway so I get it\non the whole I think it's good when\npeople have options so I have no problem\nwith women wanting to be captains\nthe issue is that this optionality\nhasn't extended to men\nstill only have one option if they want\nto be on a boat they gotta build it\nthemselves on the other hand women have\ntwo options they can be a passenger or\nthey can build their own boat\nhence the title of the episode women\nhave more options in the sexual\nMarketplace in today's world it's\nperfectly acceptable for a woman to say\nshe wants to be a passenger I want to\nfind a man get married and be supported\nwhile raising his children that's an\nappropriate and acceptable path for a\nwoman she could also say I want to have\na career Forge my own path and explore\nmy options that's also an acceptable\npath for a woman\nbut there's never been a place in the\nworld in all of human history where it\nhas been acceptable either to society or\nmore to the point to women\nfor a man's goal in life to be finding a\nwoman to support him while raising her\nkids\nand just for the record I'm not\ncomplaining about this because this\nreally isn't an attractive option for\nmany men modern feminism would like to\nliberate men from the gender-based\nshackles of tradition by normalizing\nstay-at-home dad as a vocation because\nthat's their idea of equality men can\nhave careers so women can have careers\nwomen can raise kids so men can raise\nkids it's equal but only superficially\non a deeper level it's not equal at all\nbecause modern men don't have multiple\nattractive options for them whereas\nmodern women do it is what it is the\nupshot is that women no longer need a\nman to supply them with a ship they can\nbe their own captains and while this\nsolves a number of problems it also\ncreates a host of new ones and I'll\ndiscuss one of the most significant of\nthese newly created problems in my next\nepisode so stay tuned what do you think\nplease remember to like comment and\nsubscribe for the algorithm and see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for listening"
