    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is women\ntreat men the way men treat jobs\nthis is the single most powerful\nrealization I've ever had about women in\ndating once I came to appreciate its\ntruth so many otherwise painful and\nincomprehensible things became clear to\nme and I began to have significantly\nmore successful relationships but to\napproach this idea you've got to keep an\nopen mind okay\nnow before I unpack this realization\nplease remember to like this video And\nsubscribe to the channel it takes less\nthan a second cost you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me and my mission to\ndeliver free high quality content to the\nworld so thanks for your help\nnow women treat men the way men treat\njobs what does this mean\nwomen see men as a means to an end\nto women men are opportunities to\nfurther their goals\nsimilarly men see jobs as a means to an\nend to men jobs are an opportunity to\nfurther their goals men will choose the\njob that all things being equal they\nbelieve will do the most to further\ntheir goals it's not personal it's\nsimply a rational self-interested choice\nand women will choose the man that all\nthings being equal they believe will do\nthe most to further their goals it's not\npersonal it's a rational self-interested\nChoice the more you appreciate this\nreality that it isn't personal the more\nsuccessful you'll be in the dating\nMarket\nthe women listening already understand\nthis so I'm going to be helping the men\nout there men let's say you're working a\njob\nit's not a bad job you enjoy it you're\npaid decent you like your co-workers\nthere aren't any real problems but one\nday you get a call from a recruiter and\nthe recruiter says we want to offer you\noffer you a position at a competing firm\nwe'll give you a promotion we'll double\nyour compensation we'll give you\nunlimited PTO and we'll give you full\nbenefits for life\nwhat are you gonna do\nevery man is going to at least entertain\nthe opportunity and frankly provided\nthere isn't something otherwise terrible\nabout this new position they're probably\ngoing to end up putting in their two\nweeks notice\nthey'll go to their bosses and they'll\nsay look it's been great working here\nI've learned a lot I've really enjoyed\nmy time I just feel like I have to do\nthis for my career it's not personal\nit's just the right move for me right\nnow so thank you so much for the\nopportunity and I wish you all the best\nand they'll legitimately mean that this\nguy isn't going to have any hard\nfeelings though he might feel a little\nguilty about leaving his team in the\nmiddle of a project or something he's\nnot going to feel guilty enough not to\nleave\nof course the more he dissatisfied a guy\nis with his job the less more attractive\nanother offer would have to be to be\nenticing\nhowever people don't only leave their\njobs when they hate them is my point\nthey leave because there's a better\noption out there for them with respect\nto their careers\nso switch to relationships this holds\ntrue because women have relationship\ngoals the way that men have career goals\nmost men don't have relationship goals\nthat's kind of a feminine idea women\nwant to progress the relationship the\nway that men want to progress their\ncareers this means that at the very\nleast women are always willing to pick\nup the phone when the recruiter calls\nthis means that they may not act on it\nbut they will at least entertain the\nopportunity and if that opportunity\nsounds significantly more likely to\nfurther their goals whatever they may be\nthen they're going to put in their\nnotice it doesn't necessarily mean that\nshe hates the guy that she's currently\nwith or that she isn't attracted to him\nanymore or that he wasn't a good guy\nif she's low value she'll pick a fight\nto instigate the end of the relationship\nhowever if she's high value she'll sit\nhim down and say you've been a great guy\nthank you for all the good times I just\nfeel like I have to do this for me you\nknow this is something that I need to do\nfor myself at this stage of my life it's\nnot you it's me it's not personal\ndo you see people's goals come before\ntheir relationships\na man's goals come before his\nrelationship to his employer and a\nwoman's goals come before her\nrelationship to a man\nwhen goals are aligned then people can\ndo business when they aren't it's the\nrelationship that gets canceled\nhopefully this doesn't just melt\npeople's brains the upshot is that the\nmore you can appreciate this truth the\nmore you can shift your attention to\nbeing another person's best option\nbecause this and this alone is what\nattracts and maintains relationships of\nall kinds in the real world an employer\nwith a solid compensation package\ndoesn't need to worry about his\nemployees getting calls from recruiters\ndo you understand all those phone calls\ndo is make his offer look better\nhopefully this makes sense it's a really\nimportant topic so don't blow it off\ncasually what do you think
