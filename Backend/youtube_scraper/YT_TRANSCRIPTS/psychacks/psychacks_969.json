    "transcript": "in it's good to add to your profile that\nyou're looking for a long-term\nrelationship Australian girl commented\nthat basically men are sex-starved on\ndating apps and unfortunately I would\nhave to agree\num the vast majority of men are sex\nstarved the vast majority of men are not\nhaving sex the vast majority of men do\nnot know how to get sex and they have\nvery poor optionality which is again why\nthey're moving on to the online dating\nplatform and this thirst is real and so\nyou're going to experience a lot of guys\nwho are horny and desperate for sex on\nthe online dating platforms on the other\nhand if you meet a guy on these\nplatforms that doesn't seem to be\nthirsty it's not because he's\ntranscended his sexual impulse why would\nyou even want to be in a relationship\nwith a man who has done that it's it's\nbecause he's getting sex from somebody\nelse so that's another problem that\nwomen tend to complain about but you\nhave to understand that that if men\naren't\nthirsty they're getting satisfied\nelsewhere"
