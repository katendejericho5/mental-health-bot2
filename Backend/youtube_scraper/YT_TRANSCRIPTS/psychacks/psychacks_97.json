    "transcript": "I've seen the same thing in nearly every\ncase of perfectionism that I've worked\nwith it requires a very selective\nattention to maintain to prop up the\nillusion perfectionists kind of have to\nwillfully not look at all the things\nthey can't do very well and this is made\neasier through the denigration and\ncriticism of those things after all if\nthey truly were important and meaningful\nand perfectionists weren't perfect at\nthem then what kind of cognitive\ndissonance do you think that would\ncreate so that was the first crack in\nthe facade of my perfectionism now the\nsecond crack in my perfectionism had to\ndo with the realization that I was\nemotionally identified with the products\nof my perfectionism I talk about this a\nbit in my episode how to be\nindestructible we become vulnerable and\nexposed when we allow ourselves to\nidentify with things that are not\nourselves through narcissistic extension"
