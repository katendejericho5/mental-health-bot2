    "transcript": "in my recent short when sober reality is\nmagnified mo dickens asks is it morally\nwrong to be addicted to something and\nthis is a question that i have struggled\nwith for quite some time and the answer\nthat i've come to for myself personally\nis that no it is not morally wrong to be\naddicted to something i do believe\naddiction creates a great deal of\nunnecessary pain and suffering both for\nthe addict\naddicts themselves and for those close\nto them however it's ultimately not for\nme to say how other people should live\ntheir life if a person wants to spend\ntheir potentially one and only life on\nthis planet in heroin haze or homeless\non the streets and\nit's\nokay i mean\nthey're gonna have their experience and\nmaybe they'll pass through it and maybe\nthey won't and\nthat will be their life\nit's not a wrong way to live now it is\nwrong if you have specific goals\nlike it's very hard to achieve certain\nthings if you have an act of addiction\nbut in the absence of those goals the\naddiction itself is neither right nor\nwrong"
