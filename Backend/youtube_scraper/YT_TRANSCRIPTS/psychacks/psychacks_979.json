    "transcript": "in my episode all mental illnesses are\ncompromises Marcelo Enrique Almeida asks\nhow does this relate to anxiety\nit definitely holds true with respect to\nanxiety disorders because like name some\nanxiety Source social phobia the fear of\nbeing judged by other people or\nagoraphobia the fear of being in open\nplaces or let's say specific phobia the\nfear of pickles or Bridges or things\nlike that all of those are fears\nassociated with something that's\nactually not in the vast majority of\ncases inherently threatening and that\nbehind the scenes there is a more\nexistential fear of death\nand what the person is doing is avoiding\nthe actual reality in which death is an\ninevitability and putting the fear and\nanxiety into something that is actually\nfairly innocuous because it's some way\neasier to navigate and manage does that\nmake sense"
