    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psychs\nbetter living through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is humanity\nchanges slowly if at all\nthis is something that is useful to keep\nin mind in the modern age when social\nand technological changes have swept\nacross the world and is at an\nhistorically unprecedented rate\nit can sometimes feel as though humanity\nas we know it is becoming increasingly\nunrecognizable with each passing year\nhowever this isn't actually the case and\nbefore i explain why please remember to\nlike this video and subscribe to the\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me in my mission to deliver free\nhigh quality content to the world so\nthanks for your help back to it\nthere are many new ideas circulating\nabout how human beings should live and\nhow they should organize themselves and\nthese new ideas are facilitated by an\nalmost miraculous global technological\napparatus which accelerates the whole\nprocess dramatically\nhowever as complex as modern society\nseems to be it is still a collection of\nrelationships between and among\nindividuals so much of what is true\nabout relationships remains true about\nsociety\nnow it's sometimes the case that folks\ncan get into really passionate hot and\nheavy relationships in a matter of weeks\nthey're declaring their undying love for\neach other and naming all of their\nunborn children and just when it seems\nas though they're on the cusp of some\ngreat and perfect union a few weeks\nlater passion burns out\nusually in some spectacular\nconflagration\nin relationships it's easy come easy go\nthe ones that burn the hottest and\nbrightest are often the ones that burn\nfor shorter amounts of time\nby the same token belief systems can\nsometimes be pre-potent and predominant\nin a short amount of time but like their\npassionate romantic counterparts they\noften don't last for very long\nmaybe a few years maybe a few decades\nthe soviet experiment for example lasted\n69 years a blink of an eye in the\nhistory of humanity which is hundreds of\nthousands of years old in its most\nmature evolutionary state\nto be sure these passionate political\nflames can burn fiercely and create a\ngreat deal of destruction but they can't\nsustain themselves by virtue of their\nvery intensity\nthere seem to be limits on how quickly\nhumanity can change\nthe fact of the matter is that humanity\nchanges slowly if at all\nand this is largely due to the fact that\nsome problems of existence cannot be\nsolved and therefore will always demand\nmuch of our time energy and attention\nthese includes the imperatives of\nbiology and the necessities of survival\nthe criteria for emotional well-being\nand spiritual fulfillment also don't\nreally change from year to year\nas they are deeply connected to the\nhuman organism\nthese things cannot be dispensed with in\nfavor of ideology for it to preserve\nideology must accommodate itself to\nthese realities\nfor example\nthe human race is always at most 50\nyears away from extinction\nif no further children were born today\nhumanity would be functionally extinct\nin 50 years and that's a maximum\nprojection\nkeep in mind that the bloodiest and most\ndestructive conflict in the history of\nthe world happened only 75 years ago\nthat there are people who are alive\ntoday who still remember what that was\nlike\nwe are not an enlightened race\nour institutions our social cultural and\npolitical institutions are not as\npermanent as they appear\nbut the problems that they albeit\nimperfectly attempt to solve\nare\nissues of survival aggression scarcity\nwell-being are always with us and always\nwill be with us\nacknowledging these realities might\nspare some of the devastation wrought by\nthe passion for change\nbut if they don't remember that they too\nwill burn themselves out\noh snail\nclimb mount fuji\nbut slowly\nslowly\nhopefully that makes sense did you\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and please see the\nabout tab for more information on\ndonations consultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for listening"
