    "transcript": "in my episode if you've done nothing\nwrong don't apologize kimberly brown\ndiaz comments\neven if you did not do something wrong\nit's rude not to apologize now i can see\nthat point of view however i will have\nto respectfully disagree with it and and\nhere's my counter argument if you're\nprimarily concerned with let's say\npoliteness or or rudeness\nthen i would say that\ndemanding an apology or expecting an\napology from someone who you admit did\nnothing wrong\nis more rude\nthan not apologizing for something when\nno transgression happened even if\nanother person's feelings were hurt\num\nthat if you acknowledge that the other\nperson has done nothing wrong\nthat most likely the expectation was a\ncovert contract that wasn't explicitly\nnegotiated with the other person and\nholding the other person responsible for\nyour disappointment\num is rather unpolite"
