    "transcript": "i'm dr o'ryan taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nlove your neighbor as yourself\nso this is one of the most important\nchristian principles according to jesus\nhimself\nand i think there is a spiritual truth\nto this pronouncement that is often\noverlooked\nbut before i get into it please remember\nto like this video and subscribe to the\nchannel it takes less than a second cost\nyou nothing and it's how you can support\nme in my mission to deliver free high\nquality content to the world thanks for\nyour help\nnow i think that this pronouncement love\nyour neighbor as yourself is usually\ninterpreted as a commandment\nthis is kind of the golden rule the new\nway of doing things that takes\nprecedence over the old way of doing\nthings\nthe reduction of the ten commandments\nthe old testament into the single\ncommandment of the new\nthe idea here is that this is something\npeople should and ought to do and\ncertainly you can see it from that angle\nhowever i think there's another way of\nlooking at this particular verse namely\nas an observation of a high spiritual\nreality\nto make this plainer to see we simply\nneed to include the implied subject\nwhen we do so the commandment becomes an\nobservation\nyou love your neighbor as you love\nyourself\nand i think there is a real spiritual\ntruth to this that as you love yourself\nyou love your neighbor and as you love\nyour neighbor you love yourself the two\nthings are intimately connected\nand i think this makes sense coming from\njesus because way behind the scenes and\nfrom a very high spiritual perspective\nthe other is yourself\nit's hard to see this in our everyday\nconsciousness however at a very high\nlevel you are your neighbor and your\nneighbor is you and so we really\nshouldn't expect a difference in how we\nlove ourselves and how we love our\nneighbors\nthis understanding also suggests a\ncorollary\nthat we can only love others to the\nextent\nthat we love ourselves that it's not\npossible to love another person in a\nmanner or extent beyond which we are\ncapable of loving ourselves\nand this makes sense from a\npsychological perspective when we are\nnot treated how we would like to be\ntreated by important others there is a\ntendency in our nature to believe that\nthis is due to some failing on our part\nand these negative internalizations can\nlong outlive the relationship that\nproduce them\nhowever it's important to understand\nthat how we were treated by others was a\nreflection of how these others felt\nabout themselves\nin that moment you were loved in\ncongruence with how those others loved\nthemselves because according to our\ncorollary it would not have been\npossible for them to love you any better\nhopefully that makes sense did you\nremember to like comment and subscribe\nfor the algorithm and please the about\ntab for more information on donations\nconsultations and sponsorship\nopportunities thanks for your help"
