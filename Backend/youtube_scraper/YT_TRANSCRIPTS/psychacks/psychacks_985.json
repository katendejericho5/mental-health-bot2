    "transcript": "in my episode the worst thing to say in\na dating profile shania simsel comments\nit's good to add in your profile that\nyou are looking for a long-term\nrelationship in order to weed out the f\nboys well\ni can see how that makes a superficial\nlevel of sense however i don't think it\nactually works in practice\nbut in order to back up that hypothesis\nwith some evidence i decided to activate\nmy hinge profile\nand do some swiping hinge is interesting\nbecause men and women can indicate what\ntheir dating intentions are in their\nprofile and i swiped until i saw a\nhundred\nwomen who indicated their dating\npreferences and i had the results right\nhere\nand what i discovered is that 89 of\nthose 199 percent said that they were\nlooking for a long-term relationship or\na life partner\nso if women are complaining about\nmeeting f-boys on online dating apps\nand 89 of them are saying they want a\nlong-term relationship or a life partner\ni don't think it's actually working to\nweed out the f-boys so something to\nconsider"
