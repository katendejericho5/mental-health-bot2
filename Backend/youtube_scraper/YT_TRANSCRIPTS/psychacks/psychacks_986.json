    "transcript": "i'm dr orion taraban and this is psych\nhacks better living through psychology\nand the topic of today's short talk is\nwhy men don't go to therapy\nnow this title is a bit of an\noverstatement because of course men do\ngo to therapy but they significantly\nunder utilize mental health services\nwhen compared with women\naccording to the statistics i've read\nwomen are anywhere from one and a half\nto three times more likely to seek out\nmental health services within a given\n12-month period when compared with men\nand this basically means that anywhere\nfrom 60 to 75 percent of all\npsychotherapy clients are women at any\ngiven time now why might that be\nwell i have a little theory about this\nbut before i get into it please remember\nto like this video and subscribe to the\nchannel it takes less than a second\ncosts you nothing and it's how you can\nsupport me in my mission to deliver free\nhigh quality content to the world thanks\nfor your help\nso back to my theory\nwhy might there be such a significant\ngender difference in the utilization of\nmental health services\nit's going to take a little bit for me\nto explain my theory but hopefully\nyou'll find it interesting\nso i think these gender differences can\nactually be traced back to the origin of\nmodern psychotherapy which as you\nprobably know was pioneered by sigmund\nfreud\nin the early 20th century freud was a\nmedical doctor he was a neurologist who\nlived in austria but due to the\nanti-semitism that dominated that time\nand place he was never able to really\nachieve full-fledged professional status\nmany folks wouldn't even see him as\ntheir profession uh as their treating\nphysician because he was a jew\nso freud found himself on the outskirts\nof society and on the fringes of his\nprofession and he initially struggled to\nget a foothold in his career\nnow because many people were unwilling\nto see freud as a physician\nhe kind of had to content himself with\nseeing the patients that the other\ndoctors wouldn't take on patients who\nwere like himself\nsecond class citizens in that society\nand that meant that he saw a lot of\nwomen or at least more women than he\nlikely otherwise would have seen as an\nestablishment physician\nand it was in the context of a female\ndominated\npractice that freud extrapolated his\nobservations that eventually became the\ntheory of psychoanalysis\nwe often ascribe to freud this notion\nthat psychotherapy is the talking cure\nthat if people lie down on the couch and\ntalk about their problems sufficiently\nthey tend to feel better and resolve\ntheir own neurotic illnesses that's an\noversimplification but it's kind of the\ngist of it\nnow freud did promulgate the idea of\npsychotherapy as the talking cure\nbut he didn't actually invent the term\nthat term was given to him by one of his\nfirst female patients whom we know\nthrough his notes as anna oh\ninitially freud approached his treatment\nof her in the traditional medical model\nof top-down paternalism\nanna however\nhad the temerity to basically tell freud\nto just shut up and listen\nand because freud kind of needed the\nbusiness he went along with it as an\nexperiment and lo and behold he\ndiscovered that in this patient at least\nher neurotic symptoms did improve when\nhe just shut up and let her talk\na lot of women in my audience are\nprobably rolling their eyes at this\ngiven moment but it was kind of a\nrevolutionary moment in the history of\npsychiatry the foundations of modern\npsychotherapy are firmly rooted in this\nnotion that the very act of talking\nabout your thoughts and feelings is\ninherently therapeutic and cathartic and\ni do think that there is some truth to\nthat\nbut i also think that there are some\nsignificant gender differences in\ncommunication styles\nthe idea that talking about your\nfeelings or exploring your experience is\nhelpful or rewarding\nis kind of absurd to a lot of guys\nthey look at therapy and think\nyou mean i gotta pay someone 200 bucks\nan hour to sit there and listen to me\ncomplain\nhow does that actually solve anything\nhow about i keep my 200 bucks and tell\nit to a brick wall instead\nmen tend to be more logical and rational\nand they approach their difficulties\nfrom a problem-solving perspective\nwhereas women tend to be more emotional\nand intuitive and they approach their\ndifficulties from an emotional coping\nperspective i'm not saying that women\ncan't be rational or men can't be\nemotional but that on a population level\nthese differences tend to emerge\nstatistically\nand on the whole the mental health\nprofession has a reputation for using\nand actually does use\nnon-directive emotional coping\napproaches far more often than directive\nproblem-solving strategies\nand that's a bias that tends to conform\nwith a more feminine approach to\ndifficulties\nit's not the right approach nor is it\nthe wrong approach\nbut it is just one approach albeit an\napproach that currently enjoys a pretty\nsubstantial professional market share\nand i think that it's this reputation of\nthe mental health profession that keeps\na lot of men away\nmen don't see talking about problems as\nan end in itself and\ni tend to agree with them\nand that's why men tend to resonate with\nmy approach to therapy which is very\nactive\nchallenging rational directive and\npractical\nhowever my approach is not a common one\nand i think that's kind of a problem\ni think it's one of the ways and there\nare several in which my profession fails\nmen\nand i think that if this were addressed\nif the rational argument for\npsychotherapy were made\ni think we'd see more men use mental\nhealth services than we will as a result\nof the general public campaigns to\nreduce stigma\nand that would be good both for men\nand the women they love\nthat's it for today did you remember
