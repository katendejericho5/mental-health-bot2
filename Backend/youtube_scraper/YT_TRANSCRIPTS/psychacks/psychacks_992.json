    "transcript": "I'm Dr Orion taraban and this is cycax\nBetter Living Through psychology and the\ntopic of today's short talk is the core\nemotional wound this is a very important\npsychological concept so we're going to\ntake a deeper dive today but before we\ndo please remember to like this video\nAnd subscribe to the channel takes less\nthan a second cost you nothing and it's\nhow you can support me in my mission to\ndeliver a free high quality content to\nthe world thanks for your help\nso what is the core emotional wound this\nis something that is generally inflicted\non folks in the context of their primary\nattachment relationships which means\nthat it generally occurs in the context\nof their relationships with their\nparents in childhood\nand these attachment problems could have\nbeen caused by neglect like the parent\nwas withdrawn emotionally unavailable or\nabsent\nor by over involvement which means the\nparent was invasive violating and\ndevouring\nparadoxically these wounds can both\ncreate the tendency to replicate the\nwound through identification with the\nparent\nand create the tendency to avoid\nreplicating the wound through counter\nidentification with the parent\nthese wounds distort the lens of\nsubjectivity through which individuals\nperceive reality\nthis means that people who suffer from\ncore emotional wounds will Harbor ideas\nabout themselves other people and the\nworld that warp the direct experience of\nreality to a greater or lesser extent\nthe greater the wound the greater the\nDistortion now every core emotional\nwound is fundamentally unique however\nthere are two main wounds that people\nare subject to suffer from\nthey are I'm not good enough\nand I'm not lovable\nbehind the scenes there are some\ncommonalities between these two core\nemotional wounds perhaps I'm a bad\nperson is the fundamental wound behind\nthem both but I think they're distinct\nenough to let's say conceptually\ndisambiguate them\nin general the wound\nI'm not good enough is created in\nattachment problems with the father I.E\ndaddy issues and in general the wound\nI'm not lovable is created in attachment\nproblems with the mother I.E mommy\nissues\nand keep in mind that these are not\nmutually exclusive some lucky folks have\nboth mommy and daddy issues\nnow what does this really have to do\nwith anything well people deal with\ntheir core emotional wounds through\ncompensatory behaviors for instance a\nperson who believes I'm not good enough\nwill strive to be super competent\nsuccessful and perfectionistic because\nthat's how a person essentially Bargains\nwith the world for the respect and\nvalidation they did not receive from the\nfather in appropriate quantities\non the other hand a person who believes\nI'm not lovable will strive to be\nCharming seductive and people pleasing\nbecause that's how a person Bargains\nwith the world for the love and\naffection they did not receive from the\nmother inappropriate quantities\nso folks these folks kind of believe\nthat they have to trick people into\nliking them because they think they're\nnot sufficiently lovable without\nmanifesting these behaviors\nfinally when his or her compensatory\nbehaviors are checked threatened or\nthwarted the person suffering from that\ncore emotional wound is thrown into a\nprofound state of emotional\ndysregulation\ndepending on the size and intensity of\nthe wound a person in such a situation\ncould even be suicidal because the\nfailure of the compensatory behaviors\nnow constitutes an existential threat to\ntheir very being serious stuff\nokay there's definitely a lot more to\nsay about core emotional wounds but\nthat's enough for a general overview\nkeep in mind that healing these wounds\nis something that a good psychotherapist\ncan help you with so if you recognize\nyourself in this description know that\nthere is a way out\nwhat do you think did you remember to\nlike comment and subscribe for the\nalgorithm and please see the about tab\nfor more information on donations and\nconsultations\nthanks for listening"
