    "transcript": "and don't be the last guy to leave the\nparty yt asks did you ever have to take\na leap from the standard paths\nuh i'm laughing because i feel like my\nwhole life has been a leap from one\nstandard path or another\nfor example i understood from a very\nyoung age that i could never work a 9 to\n5 in an office where all the days were\nthe same and i was looking forward to\nfriday and dreading mondays i would\nrather shoot my face off\nthe way i think about life\nis sort of like buying clothes\nif you buy your clothes off the rack the\nbest you can hope for is an 80 85\nfit and that's because those clothes are\nnot actually made for you\nif you want clothes to actually fit your\nspecific body you need to get them\ncustom tailored that's going to be\nexpensive that's going to be time\nconsuming but it's the only way to get a\nperfect fit between you and your clothes\nsame is true about life\nno one is going to give you the lie"
