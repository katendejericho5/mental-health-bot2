    "transcript": "in the truth about commitment ashy kitty\nleaves a very interesting comment\nattempting to renovate modern marriage\nby proposing marriage by renewable\ncontract\nbasically people get married for a\nlimited time five to ten years they\nspell out their explicit expectations\none for the other with the understanding\nthat they will examine those\nexpectations at a future date to renew\nthe contract or not it's really\ninteresting idea in theory i respect it\nbut i think would be very hard to\nimplement in practice because in\npractice marriage is this conflation of\ntwo really powerful ideas it's the\nconflation of friendship and emotion\nand\nbusiness and legality if a friend were\nto come to you and say look ashley i\nreally like you um but here are my\nexpectations for being your friend over\nthe next five years please sign this\ncontract and if you bulk on any of these\ni'm going to take you to friend court\nand will not renew our friendship at\nthat time\nyou would probably be off put by that\nidea and yet\nhere we are with marriage"
