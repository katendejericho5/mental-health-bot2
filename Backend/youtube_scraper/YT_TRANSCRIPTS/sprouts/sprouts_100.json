    "transcript": "[Music]\nsapolsky's theory of human behavioral\nbiology claims that behind\nevery behavior is a biological process\nthat is the product of natural selection\nif sapolsky is right this implies that\nto truly understand human behavior\nwe would have to know exactly what\nhappens in the 100 trillion connections\nof the brain\na nanosecond before the behavior occurs\nand consider what took place\nabout 5 million years ago when humans\nand chimpanzees shared their last common\nancestor\nand all the stuff that happened in\nbetween\nfor example when we see someone who has\ndone something wonderful and altruistic\nor something brutal and savage we can\nask ourselves why did he do that just\nnow\n[Music]\nand when we ask that we are asking\nsomething about what neurons in\ndifferent parts of their brain did a\nfraction of a second ago\nbut we are also asking about what\nenvironmental stimuli in the previous\nseconds to minutes triggered those\nneurons\nand we are also asking what did hormone\nlevels in that morning have to do with\nmaking those neurons more or less\nsensitive to those triggers\nand then we are often running into\nneuroplasticity\nhow his experience changed those neurons\nin previous months\n[Music]\nthen you are back to adolescence and\nchildhood and all the way back into his\nfetal life which has a huge amount to do\nwith what sort of brain we are going to\nhave as adults\nand even further back genes come in and\nculture because the way you were raised\nwithin minutes of birth\nreflects the culture that your ancestors\nwere coming up with centuries ago\n[Music]\nand at the bottom of the barrel why we\nevolved into this kind of species\ninstead of that kind\nif you trust sapolsky's theory of\nbehavioral biology\nyou may at this point realize that\nthings are much more complicated\nwhile a simple sheeted a so heated b may\nfulfill your need to bring order into\nthis chaotic world\nit is likely not going to be the full\nexplanation\nzapolsky was born in new york and he\nspent his youth reading about and\nimagining living with silverback\ngorillas\nby age 12 he was writing fan letters to\nprimatologists\nand during high school he taught himself\nswahili\nlater he spent 25 years observing the\nsame group of baboons in africa every\nsummer\nand then went on to study and teach\nbehavioral biology at stanford\nuniversity\nsapolsky left for those who try to\nunderstand others the following advice\nwe are complicated so you better be\nreally sure\nand really careful and really cautious\nbefore you decide you\nunderstand why somebody did something\nespecially if that is something you are\njudging harshly\nit's like trying to judge how a movie\ngot to its conclusion by only watching\n30 seconds of it\nwhat do you think is his theory solid\nand can we actually never really explain\na behavior without taking the full\npicture into consideration\nor is there something like a soul that\ntakes decisions regardless of what\nhappens to us biologically\n[Music]\nsprouts videos are published under the\ncreative commons license\nthat means our videos are free and\nanyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools\ngovernments and non-profit organizations\ncan also use them for training\nonline courses or designing new\ncurriculums\nto help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our patrons and\ncontribute\njust visit patreon.com sprouts even one\ndollar can make a difference"
