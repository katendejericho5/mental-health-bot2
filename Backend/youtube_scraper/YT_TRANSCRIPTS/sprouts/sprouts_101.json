    "transcript": "the following 10 rules\nwhich are based on decades of research\naim to demonstrate that the standard way\nto teach\nchildren math is counterproductive\nbecause it focuses\non symbols to be able to think\nmathematically however\nmeans not to think in symbols but to\nlearn to think\nin relationships\nmath can't be taught just like we can't\nlearn ping pong from watching videos\nchildren can't learn math from reading\ntextbooks or listening to a teacher\ninstead they learn math by doing math\nideally with real objects because only\nwhen they do math\nrelationships are constructed right\nwhere math happens\nin their heads\nit happens in the head whatever is on\npaper is merely a representation of\nmathematical thinking\nthat happens in the brain just like\nmusical notes\nwhat is on paper is just a\nrepresentation of music\nthat actually happens when someone plays\nthe piano\n[Music]\nto be a good musician it's not enough to\nbe able to read the notes\nwe also need to practice a lot the same\nis true for math\nwhich is why practicing mental\narithmetic is so important\nmath needs years of practice this\nbecomes clear when we look at how\nchildren\nlearn to understand a number say eight\nnot the symbol eight but the idea of the\nquantity of eight\nto internalize this seemingly simple\nidea\nchildren need a lot of practice in two\nskills\nfirst they need to learn how to create\norder\nand then later on how to create\nhierarchical relationships\nlet's look at order first\nconstruct order when four-year-olds\nlearn to count\nmost have trouble ordering objects in\ntheir heads\nif the things they count are unevenly\ndistributed\nsometimes they skip objects then they\ncount the same ones twice\nto do it right children have to learn\nhow to construct\norder in their heads this seems easy\nbut actually takes our brains a lot of\npractice\nonce children learn to order objects in\ntheir heads\nthey can put them in relationships\nhierarchical relationships as children\nconstruct\norder they count the objects as follows\none two three four\nfive six seven and eight\nas they do that the number eight\nrepresents the eighth\nplace in the order in other words eight\nalways includes\none two three four five six seven\nthe idea of eight is therefore a\nhierarchical\nrelationship between the eighth object\nand all those preceding it\nif we don't learn to do this sort of\nabstraction by doing lots of math in our\nheads\nwe won't be able to form a solid\nfoundation for arithmetic\nafter building them children need to\nlearn to break relationships apart again\nwe can see how hard this is when we\npresent a five-year-old an image of six\ndogs and two cats and then ask are there\nmore dogs or more\nanimals while most adults who see the\nfull picture\nfind this question odd a five-year-old\ntypically just answers\nmore dogs when you ask further\nmore dogs than what the child replies\nthan\ncats in other words if you ask are there\nmore dogs or more animals\nthe child hears are there more dogs or\nmore cats\nat age 5 most kids didn't practice\nenough math to break hierarchical\nrelationships apart\nwhile still remembering the whole\nthis happens because once the child has\nto cut the hole into parts\nfor them at that moment the whole no\nlonger exists\nthey have not yet constructed the\nconcept of eight\nwithout thinking of it as a sum of its\nparts\nso when they divide the animals into\ncats and dogs\nall they can think of are two parts of\nwhich one looks larger\nthe idea of eight is then forgotten\nto also think about all animals would\nrequire\ntwo opposite mental actions first\ndivide the whole and then put it back\ntogether\na mental process that most five-year-old\nchildren\nprecisely can't do only by age\nseven most children can see the whole\nand keep its abstraction in their heads\nand still divide the sum in its parts\nexperiences precedes language\nas we demonstrated it takes a child a\nlot of mental training\nand hands-on experiences to form the\nconcept of a number\nat the age of five we can build a simple\nrow of\neight later form eight square then eight\nroot only once we have constructed\nnumber concepts inside our heads\ncan we effectively learn how to express\nthem with images\nsymbols and language\nmath can be expressed in different\nlanguages\na hundred thousand years ago we used\nobjects to express our mathematical\nthinking\nlater we used images around one\nthousand years ago we began to reduce\nimages to arabic\nnumeral symbols in future we might\nreplace symbols with bits\nor express math in graphic simulations\nor\ngames in other words while math thinking\nalways happens in our heads the language\nthat represents our thinking\nis evolving\nmost people don't have math but language\nproblems\nwe know for example that eleven-year-old\nunschooled street vendors\nare often highly proficient in complex\nmoney transactions\nbut incapable of doing paper and pencil\narithmetic\nthis phenomenon known as street\nmathematics\nshows that when smart kids struggle in\nschool they often just can't express\ntheir thinking in symbols their brains\ncan do\nmath but have language problems\none way to solve this is to do it your\nway\njust like nobody ever learned to speak a\nlanguage just by learning the rules of\ngrammar\nnobody learns math by memorizing the\nrules of how to arrange\nnumbers and symbols in order to find the\nright answer to a problem\nwhenever we do that we stop constructing\nfundamental principles inside our heads\nto get better and confident children\nshould be encouraged to find their own\npath\nand use their own language to express a\nsolution\nwhich brings us back to rule one\nmath can't be taught it has to be\nconstructed\nif we want to learn math we have to do\nmath in our heads\nideally with real life experiences\nlater we replace the objects with\nabstractions\nsuch as language symbols or whatever the\nfuture might bring\nthe ideas presented in this video are\nbased on the work of jean piaget\nconstance comey keith devlin georgia de\nclark\nand jerome bruner who all contributed\nimmensely to the body of work and\nresearch on\nhow children and adults learn math\nif you want to get better at math today\njoin keith devlin from
