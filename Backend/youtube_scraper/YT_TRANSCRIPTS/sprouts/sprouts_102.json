    "video_title": "The Whole Child: Ackermannâ€™s 4 Natural Forces of Development",
    "transcript": "the idea of the whole\nchild pays respect to the fact that\nthere are many aspects of human\npotential that grades can't measure\nbesides curiosity and intelligence\nchildren may want to develop creativity\npassion resilience intuition\nconfidence generosity mindfulness\nhumor and many many other important\ntraits\n[Music]\nedith ackerman's theory of the whole\nchild development\nidentifies four natural urges that drive\nour growth\nthroughout childhood into adult life\nbeing me\nus the world and human creations\neach of these four urges can be divided\ninto two subcategories\nto understand them better let's look at\nthe theory from the perspective of a\nyoung girl\n[Music]\nbeing me is about learning to use my\nbody and exploring my mind\nthe ability to control my body allows me\nto discover the world\nand as a result i can get to know where\ni'm at and who i\nam by using my body\ni put my five senses to work this is how\ni learn to walk\nspeak listen and develop healthy habits\nsoon i might impress older folks with my\nclear speech good posture and other\nphysical capabilities\nknowing myself helps me to develop a\nvoice in my home\nand find my place in this world it\nallows me to learn what i like\nwhat i don't like and what potential is\nstill inside of me\nby knowing who i am i can understand my\nown subjectivity and form an identity i\nam proud of\nus is about how i relate to friends\nfamily and strangers and my\nunderstanding of their thoughts\nfeelings and behaviors\nlet me begin with relating to others as\na child\ni seek the love attention and respect\nfrom my parents\nbut i also have a fundamental natural\nurge to have social interactions with\nothers\nthat means i need to learn to share and\ncare so i can belong\none day i want to become a respected\nmember of a group while keeping my own\nidentity\nunderstanding others is another thing i\nwant to learn about my friends and their\nemotions\nintentions ways of thinking and\nbehaviors interest me\ni want to learn to move away from my own\nlimited point of view\nand integrate other people's perspective\nto develop a more complex understanding\nof morality and social problems\nmaking sense of the world means figuring\nout how things work\nthat's why we play through exploration i\nquench my thirst for seeking logic and\ndiscover this universe\nadults call it exploring and\ninvestigating we call it play that's how\nwe learn\nsometimes it gets messy but by playing i\nrealize that some things change while\nothers don't\nin other words i learn how things work\nlater i can become a real scientist who\nplays with big ideas and theories and\nexplains the\nworkings of this world to you\ni am seeking logic all the time us\nchildren don't just want to discover how\nthings work\nwe also look for consistency where there\nis little\nto make sense of this world we filter\ninterpret and reconstruct what we\nexperience into mental models\ni think adults call them schema this\nurge for order helps me to reorganize\nwhat i learn\ninfer rules and apply fundamental laws\nin real life\nhuman creations is about me being able\nto imagine alternatives in my head\nif i can image something new i am able\nto go\nand actually create it\nimaginating is one of human's greatest\nachievements\nwithout imagination all innovation would\nhappen by chance\nthat's why i need fantasy and a lot of\nfree time to play pretend\nthis way i will learn to think out of\nthe box\nthrough creations i can express my\nthoughts and bring my imagination to\nlife\nand there are hundreds of ways to do so\ni can create atmosphere with my voice\nideas with my head and pictures that i\npaint with my hand\nif i am given the space i can create\ncozy rooms beneath the kitchen table\nor one day when i'm older design an\nentire house\nedith ackerman was born in switzerland\nin 1946\nafter graduating she became a protege of\njean piaget\nat mit media lab where she spent most of\nher career\nshe was exploring the interactions\nbetween play learning\nand design whole child development\nalso known as holistic education seeks\nto engage\nchildren in the whole of their being and\npotential\nit assumes that each child arrives at\nthis world with their own set of talents\nand\ninterests that are to some degree\ncompletely independent from the child's\nupbringing\n[Music]\nsome refer to this whole as the mind\nbody and soul\nthe swiss educator pestilozzi referred\nto it\nas the hand the heart and the head and\nfurther still\nmany others try to sum up a child in\nfour eight skills\nsocial emotional and so forth but does\nany such division actually pay respect\nto the whole\ndoes it capture a sense of humor and\nappreciation of the arts\nor the ability to be mindful for this\nreason\nthe work of ackerman offers a more\nwholesome perspective\nwhat are your thoughts please share them\nin the comments
