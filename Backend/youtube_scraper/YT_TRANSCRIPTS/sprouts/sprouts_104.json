    "transcript": "a schema is a generalization of past\nexperiences that forms a scripted\npattern of thought\nfor example we all have a specific\nprocess in mind when we think about\ngoing to a restaurant\nimagine standing in line placing an\norder and eating\nand then throwing the trash away others\nimagine being seated then ordering\nsharing everything\nand then paying leaving a generous tip\nwe can think of a schema as a mental\nframework\nin the form of a kid's toy things we\nalready\nfully understand say a triangle get into\nour brain without a problem\nwhen new information is similar to what\nwe know say a square\nit can enter the brain through\nassimilation for completely new\ninformation\nhear a star this doesn't work then we\nneed accommodation and to change the\nschema itself\nassimilation is the cognitive process of\nmaking\nnew information fit in with your\nexisting understanding of the world\nit works if new information is close to\nwhat we already know\nto process the new information we make\nit fit into our existing schemas\nwe have to use accommodation if things\nare so unique that they don't fit into\nour existing schema\nin other words to understand something\ntruly new\nwe first have to remodel our brain space\njust imagine you were born completely\ncolorblind\nnot a million books or the best teacher\ncould ever truly explain\nred to you you need to experience it to\naccommodate the idea\nfrederick bartlett demonstrated how\nschema unconsciously alter\nour perception and memory in what became\nknown as the war of the ghosts\nexperiment\nhe did that by reading to his british\nstudents\na strange native american folk tale from\nthe chinook tribe\nthe story involved ghosts hunting seals\ngoing to war and canoeing\nlater he monitored how the students\nrecalled what they remembered from the\nstory\nfirst days then weeks and then months\nafter\nthree striking things happened\n1. omission of unfamiliar details\nmultiple students did not recall a part\nabout the chinooks going hunting seals\nthis happens because hunting seals does\nnot naturally\nfit into the cultural context of rich\nbritish students\nin other words they do not have an\nexisting schema for this kind of\ninformation\ntherefore they have a hard time\nunderstanding it\nand hence can't move it into their\nlong-term memory\nfor later recall and so they forget\nbartlett argued that psychologically we\nconceive anything that doesn't\nfit our schema as irrelevant\n2. familiarization of things strange\nsome of the students that initially did\nremember the part about hunting seals\nlater recalled the activity as going\nfishing\na canoe that was loaded with weapons was\nremembered as a rowboat\nthis happens because when we lack the\nwords to describe\nnew unique experiences we use idioms\nor figures of speech in other words\nwe channel unfamiliar information\nthrough the framework of a familiar\nschema\nand because we do that every time we\nrecall that unique experience\nover time it becomes more familiar and\nless authentic\n3. rationalization of the illogical\nright after it was told most students\nthought that the tale was strange\na few weeks later however it suddenly\nmade a lot of sense to some of them\nthe students began to add terms such as\ntherefore\nand because and unconsciously made the\nstory\ncasual and logically coherent\nwhenever they retrieved it from memory\nthey added a reason\nthe chinooks didn't go hunting seals or\nto war\non their canoes they took the boats\nbecause they wanted to go\nfishing bartlett noted that each time\nthe students were asked to recall the\nstory\nit had changed a bit which means that\nlong-term memories are neither\nfixed nor immutable but are constantly\nbeing adjusted\nthis supports the existentialist view\nthat people construct the past in a\nconstant process of adjustment\nin other words much of what we remember\nis rationalized into a self-narrative\nthat allows us to think of our life as a\ncoherent string of events\njean piaget who coined the term argued\nthat we construct our experiences into\nskimata\nso we can make sense of the world\nsprouts videos are published under the\ncreative commons license\nthat means our videos are free and\nanyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools\ngovernments and non-profit organizations\ncan also use them for training\nonline courses or designing new\ncurriculums\nto help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our patrons and\ncontribute\njust visit patreon.com sprouts\neven one dollar can make a difference\nyou"
