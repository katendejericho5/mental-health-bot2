    "transcript": "Freud's theory of psychosexual\ndevelopment claims that as we grow up we\npass through\nfive critical phases.\nOur sex drive, which Freud called the\nLibido,\nfocuses in a different erogenous zone at\neach phase.\nThe phases are called Oral, Anal,\nPhallic, Latency and Genital.\nIf our experience during any of these\nphases was traumatic\nwe might develop fixations later in life\nsuch as neurosis, dependencies addictions,\nor depression.\nThe Oral Phase,\nage zero to one.\nIn the first year of our\nlives\nwe discover the world through our oral\nsenses. Our main pleasure comes from\nsucking our mother's breast or a bottle.\nThe conflict that occurs now is the\nweaning from our primary caregiver.\nHans is weaned off his mother's breast\nwithout trauma.\nErnst's mother stops feeding him within\nfour months of birth\nwhich is too early.\nIda is often left\nalone\ncrying when she is hungry.\nHans becomes a healthy and independent\nadult.\nErnst suffers from trauma and develops\nan oral fixation. He tries to compensate for it by chewing\ngum all the time.\nIda spends her entire life looking for\nthe oral stimulation she was denied as\nan\ninfant and therefore develops a\nmanipulative and addictive personality.\nThe a=Anal Phase, age one to three.\nThe primary focus of our Libido at this\nage is the control of the bladder and\nbowel movements.\nWe have to learn how to use the potty.\nHan's parents\npraise his attempts to use the toilet\nand encourage him to learn at his own\npace.\nErnst's parents force potty training on\nhim too early\nand punish him for mistakes. Ida's\nparents neglect\nany efforts at potty training entirely.\nHans develops a competent personality\nand a good and balanced relationship\nwith authority.\nErnst develops an anal retentive\npersonality.\nHe becomes an over-controlling and\nstingy adult\nwith disgust for his own body and a\ntendency to obey authority.\nIda develops an anal expulsive\npersonality.\nShe becomes messy disorganized\ninconsiderate of other people's feelings\nand rebellious against authority.\nThe Phallic Phase, age three to six.\nOur Libido now turns to the genitals as\nwe discover the differences between the\nfemale and the male\ngender. The boy's conflict in this phase\noccurs as a rivalry with their father,\nalso called the 'Oedipus Complex'. Ernst\nand Hands desire to possess their mother\nand fantasize about getting rid of their\nfather\nBut they know that their father is\nstronger and fear being\npunished for their desire. Freud called\nthis\n'Castration Anxiety'. Ida experiences\n'Penis Envy'. She believes that a penis is\nthe key to power and domination\nand also wants one.\nHan's father was very present during\nthat phase.\nLater, Hans resolves this conflict by\nidentifying strongly with him.\nHe learns to take on a male role. As an\nadult he respects both genders. Ernst,\nwhose father was absent during that\nphase, fails to develop a strong sense of\nmanhood.\nHe has a mother fixation and is not sure\nabout his sexuality.\nHe also tends to be aggressive towards\nwomen and\nconstantly needs to compete with other\nmen. Ida,\nlike all women, maintains her penis envy\nfor the rest of her life\nwhich in her case causes an inferiority\ncomplex towards men.\nLatent Phase, age seven to thirteen.\nIn this phase our Libido is suppressed\nas our sexual energy is being sublimed\ninto developing\nlife skills. Our Superego strengthens\nand we strongly identify with social\nvalues,\nsame-sex heroes, and friends.\nHans follows many hobbies. Ernst loves\nlearning at school,\nand Ida makes lots of new girlfriends.\nThere is no real conflict in this phase.\nAll three of them benefit for the rest\nof their lives from the skills they\ndeveloped\nduring latency.\nThe Genital Phase, puberty to death.\nOnce we reach puberty our libido starts\nto become\nactive again and we develop an interest\nin sexual partners.\nHans, Ida and Ernst face the challenge\nof balancing the sexual desires of the\nId\nand the needs of the Superego to obey\nsocial norms.\nThe development of a strong Ego helps to\nfind a compromise between the two.\nHans, who has experienced a childhood\nwithout much trauma,\nsucceeds in building a strong Ego. He is\ndisciplined at work,\nhas a loving relationship. and a\nfulfilled sex\nlife. Ernst's Ego is weaker than his\nsuperego\nhe obeys norms and authorities and as a\nresult\nsuppresses his desires which leads to\nthe development of perversions.\nIda has a weak Ego and a weak Superego.\nHer sexual needs are more important than\nsocial norms or other people's feelings.\nShe is egoistic and feels no guilt for\nbreaking the law or hurting others.\nTo understand the theory we need to see\nit in the context of\nFreud's famous work on the unconscious.\nBy acknowledging that we have a\nsubconscious.\nHe also implied that we store memories\nof early childhood\nand other experiences without even\nrealizing it.\nThese past experiences then\nunconsciously influence our behavior on\na daily basis.\nFreud claimed that our mind operates in\nthree spheres\nwhich we can imagine as a submarine. The Unconscious\nlevel operates the Id.\nThe Preconscious level operates the\nSuperego. The Conscious and Preconscious levels\noperate our Ego.\nYoung children are driven by the Id and\ndemand immediate satisfaction.\nAt around age seven we begin to develop a\nSuperego and want to become good moral\ncitizens and please\nothers. The Ego is formed with\nadolescence\nto balance the two forces.\nSigmund Shlomo Freud was an Austrian\nneurologist and the founder of\nPsychoanalysis. Freud theorized that the\nUnconscious would remember and store\nall our experiences later they pop up\nfrom time to time\nthrough dreams and associative thoughts.\nBy revealing traumatic memories and\ndesires through conversation\nwe can free ourselves from our neuroses\nand live a more healthy and fulfilled\nlife. He recommended we should not strive\nto eliminate our complexes\nbut to get into accord with them. They\nare legitimately what directs\nour conduct in the world.\nWhat do you think about this theory and\nthe practice of psychoanalysis?\nIs there some truth in it? Do we have an\nunconscious?\nIf so does it really store all our\nchildhood experiences\nand influence our behavior as adults?\nPlease share your thoughts in the\ncomments below!\nSprouts videos are published under the\nCreative Commons License.\nThat means our videos are free and\nanyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools\ngovernments and non-profit organizations\ncan also use them for training\nonline courses or designing new\ncurriculums.\nTo help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our Patrons and\ncontribute\njust visit patreon.com sprouts.
