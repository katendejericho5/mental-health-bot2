    "video_title": "Skinnerâ€™s Operant Conditioning: Rewards & Punishments",
    "transcript": "Operant conditioning is based on the\nidea that we can increase or decrease a\ncertain behavior by adding a consequence.\nFor example if a dog poops on a carpet\nwe can either provide reinforcement so\nthe dog does it again or punishments of\nthe dog stops. Both reinforcement and\npunishment can either be positive or\nnegative, which means we have four\npossible ways to teach this dog a lesson.\nWe can draw the four options in a table:\nif reinforcement is positive we add\nsomething pleasant like a cookie to\nincrease the likelihood of a behavior. If\nreinforcement is negative we still want\nto increase the desired behavior this\ntime by removing something unpleasant\nlike the leash. If punishment is positive\nwe add an unpleasant response to\ndecrease behavior. When punishment is\nnegative we also want to decrease\nbehavior now by removing something\npleasant like the comfy carpet. If we\nstop any sort of manipulation the\nconditioned behavior will eventually\ndisappear again.\nThis is called extinction. Operant\nconditioning was first studied by Edward\nL. Thorndike and later made famous by the\nwork of B.F. Skinner. Skinner believed that\norganisms are doing what they do\nnaturally until they accidentally\nencounter a stimulus that creates\nconditioning which results in a change\nin behavior. To test this he placed a rat\ninside an operant conditioning chamber\nwhich later became known as the Skinner\nBox. Among other things inside the box\nwas a lever that would release food when\npressed. Conditioning happens in a\nthree-term contingency today known as\nthe ABCs of behavior. A stands for\nantecedent: the rat accidentally hits the\nlever that triggers the release of food.\nB stands for behavior and refers to the\nresponse: the rat keeps pressing the\nlever. C stands for consequence: food\nkeeps coming out.\nThe strength of the response to the\nconditioning depends on the schedule of\nreinforcement. If there is always food\nafter pressing, the rat behaves\npredictably. If the food is released\nrandomly the rat behaves erratically,\nlike an addict. Skinner born in 1904 was\na professor of psychology and subscribed\nto behaviorism. He argued that you can\nonly study behavior that is visible and\nanything happening only within the mind\nis either a misconception or irrelevant\nto science.\nHe thought free will was an illusion\nbecause behavior is either random or a\nreaction to the environment. His work\nbecame the foundation for behavioral\ntherapy, military drills, and animal\ntraining. You can try this classroom\nexercise on positive reinforcement: One\nindividual must exit the room. Now decide\non a task which that individual will\ncomplete, such as finding a particular\nbook. Then choose an honorable way of\nreinforcing that tasks such as clapping\nyour hands. Invite the person to come\nback into the room and let them try and\ncomplete the task but don't give any\ninstructions. Every time they are on the\nright track in regards to completing the\ntask clap your hands louder. If they move\naway from performing the task reduce\nyour applause or stop it entirely. Once\nthe person understands what they are\nsupposed to do let them explain the task.\nDid they get it right?\nSprouts videos are published under the\nCreative Commons license that means our\nvideos are free and anyone can download\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools, governments and nonprofit\norganizations can also use them for\ntraining, online courses or designing new\ncurriculums.\nTo help us stay independent and support\nour work you can join our patrons and\ncontribute just visit: patreon.com/\nsprouts.
