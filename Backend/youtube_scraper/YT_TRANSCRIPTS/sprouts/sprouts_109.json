    "video_title": "Watsonâ€™s Theory of Behaviourism",
    "transcript": "John B. Watson famously claimed that if he\nwere to be given a dozen healthy infants\nhe could shape them into anything:\ndoctors, lawyers, artists, beggars or\nthieves, regardless of their background\nor genetic predispositions. First he\ncompleted experiments with eight-month\nold Albert and later he applied his\ntheory when raising his own children. In\nessence he applied the scientific method\nto human psychology which he called\nbehaviorism. With the little Albert\nexperiment\nWatson used the method of classical\nconditioning to program a baby to be\nafraid of a lab rat. Earlier Pavlov\ndemonstrated how conditioning can\ntrigger biological responses that are\ninherited genetically. Watson\nhypothesized that we can also instill\nnew behaviors that were not inherited. To\nconduct the experiment Watson and his\nassistant Rosalie Rayner placed the boy\nin a room where a white rat was allowed\nto roam around. First, the boy showed no\nfear.\nThen Rayner struck a steel bar with a\nhammer every time Albert reached out to\ntouch the rat, scaring Albert and causing\nhim to cry. Eventually, Albert tried to\nget away from the rat showing that he\nhad been conditioned to fear the rat.\nWeeks later Albert showed distress\ntowards any furry object showing that\nhis conditioning had not only been\nsustained but also generalized. Watson\nassumed that our behavior is either a\nreflex evoked by a stimulus or a\nconsequence of our individual history of\nearlier exposure to reinforcements and\npunishments paired with our current\nmotivational states and stimuli.\nUnlike Freud and Jung he was not\ninterested in thoughts or the mind\nbecause in his opinion the analysis of\nactions and reactions were the only way\nto apply the scientific method to\npsychology and get objective insights\ninto human behavior.\nHe thought of psychology as an objective\nbranch of Natural Science, its goal the\nprediction and control of behavior. Like\nhis fellow behaviorists he believed that\nintelligence, temperament, and personality\nare determined by the environment in\nwhich the child is raised. Watson\npublished \"the psychological care of\ninfant and child\". In his book he advised\nparents not to touch their children too\noften and to keep an emotional distance so\nas not to spoil them. Playing with\nchildren, he warned, would interrupt their\nroutines. A happy child doesn't cry or\nseek attention. His book became a\nbest-seller and soon other scientists of\nhis time advised against showing\naffection. Some Western governments\nstarted to hand out leaflets advising\nthat parents should stop kissing their\nchildren. Parents developed the idea that\nchildren should be left to sit quietly\nduring the day at night, they should be\nleft crying alone until they fall asleep.\nA method called sleep training. Watson\nwho had a difficult childhood wanted to\nbe a good father and applied his methods\nto his four children John, Mary, James, and\nWilliam. Unfortunately things didn't turn\nout as planned: John complained\nthroughout his entire life about\nintolerable headaches and died early in\nhis 50s. Mary developed a drinking\nproblem and attempted suicide, like her\nbrother James. William took his own life\nat age 40. Watson allegedly admitted that\nhe regretted writing about child-rearing\nas he realized he didn't know enough\nabout it to do so. Towards the end of his\nlife he became reclusive and prior to\nhis death in 1958\nhe burned all of his recent papers. What\ndo you think? Watson was convinced that\nthe kind of nurturing we receive can\ndetermine our life path claiming that he\ncould turn an infant into any man he\nwishes, in his own family though\ndepression and bad habits were passed on\nfrom generation to generation. Does this\nhappen due to genetic predispositions or\nis it the effect of a child's\nunfortunate upbringing?\nSprouts videos are published under the\nCreative Commons license that means our\nvideos are free and anyone can download,\nedit and play them for personal use and\npublic schools governments and nonprofit\norganizations can also use them for\ntraining, online courses, or designing new\ncurriculums.\nIf you want to help us reach more\nstudents you can subscribe to our\nchannel and hit the bell button, or share\nthis video with a friend! to help us stay\nindependent and support our work you can\njoin our patrons and contribute!
