    "video_title": "Vygotsky's Theory of Cognitive Development in Social Relationships",
    "transcript": "Vygotsky's theory of social development\nargues that community and language play\na central part in learning. While Jean\nPiaget concluded that children's\ncognitive development happens in stages,\nVygotsky rejected his ideas and believed\nthat children develop independently of\nspecific stages as the result of social\ninteractions.\nVygotsky claimed that we are born with\nfour elementary mental functions:\nattention, sensation, perception and\nmemory. It is our social and cultural\nenvironment that allows us to use these\nelementary skills to develop and finally\ngain higher mental functions. This\ndevelopment\nideally happens in the zone of proximal\ndevelopment. First, there is what we can\ndo on our own. Then there is the zone of\nproximal development, which represents\nwhat we can do with the help of an adult,\na friend, technology, or what Vygotsky\ncalled the \"more knowledgeable other\".\nLast, there is what's beyond our reach.\nTo illustrate this let us think of twins\nwho were raised in a community in which\nboys are expected to learn and succeed\nwhile girls are only expected to be\npretty. At the age of 10 months both have\nthe ability to crawl and are in the zone\nof proximal development for learning how\nto stand on their feet. The more\nknowledgeable other, in this case the\nfather, provides the boy with\nopportunities to practice in a playroom\nthat he is equipped with scaffolding and\nother objects. The boy is encouraged to\nexplore the equipment and eventually he\nuses it to pull himself up. A few hours\nlater he's cruising along the structures\nand a few days later he's standing on\nhis feet. The girl also has the potential\nto stand but does not receive any\nsupport in learning the skill.\nWhen we compare the two we see that\nwhile the girl is still trying to get up,\nthe boy has moved into a new zone. He\nknows how to balance while standing and\nnow has the potential to learn how to\nwalk.\nBoth will eventually learn how to walk\nbut according to Vygotsky the boy will\nbe more skilled. The same principles\napply to all learning and the\ndevelopment of higher cognitive\nfunctions and only those learning with\nthe assistance of a capable mentor can\nreach the full potential of their\nability. Vygotsky, therefore, believed that\ninside the Zone Of Proximal Development\nlearning can precede development, which\nmeans, that a child is able to learn\nskills that go beyond their natural\nmaturity. He also established an explicit\nconnection between speech and mental\nconcepts, arguing that inner speech\ndevelops from external speech via a\ngradual process of internalization. This\nmeans that thought itself develops as a\nresult of conversation.\nTherefore younger children who don't\nfinish this process can only think out\nloud. Once the process is complete inner\nspeech and spoken language become\nindependent.\nLev Vygotsky died of tuberculosis in\n1934 at the age of 37. Despite his young\nage he became one of the most\ninfluential psychologists of the 20th\ncentury. He left the following advice for\neducators: by giving students practice in\ntalking with others we give them frames\nfor thinking on their own. What do you\nthink? Can a child learn anything\nregardless of any developmental\nprerequisites? And do we learn only\nthrough social and cultural contexts? And\nif so, do you think it is appropriate for\na more knowledgeable other to determine\nwhat a child should learn next? Share\nyour thoughts in the comments below!\nif you like this video and the way we\nexplain the subject subscribe to our\nchannel we try to explain complex\nsubjects and simple language and\ncartoons to support students all around\nthe world in their learning if you want\nto support us you can go to WWII and\ncalm sprouts and donate just $1 from\nmany fans makes a big difference"
