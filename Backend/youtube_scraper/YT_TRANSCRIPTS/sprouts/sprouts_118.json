    "transcript": "A placebo is a treatment with zero\ntherapeutic value but magical healing\npower. Common placebos include sugar\npills inert saline injections, other\nprocedures and surgeries that are\ncompletely fake. Placebos are especially\neffective to treat pain, chronic stress\nrelated diseases, like insomnia, and forms\nof depression. What most don't realize is\nthat while placebos are fake the placebo\neffect does it's magic even if you get\nreal treatments from a normal doctor.\nPlacebos tend to follow one simple rule:\nthe more ritualized and extreme the fake\ntreatment the more effective their\neffect. In short, sugar pills work well,\nsham surgery works wonders. Since\nstandard doctor appointments are often\nhighly ritualized the placebo effect is\npart of the cure we think we receive. To\nunderstand this better let's look at Mr.\nand Mrs. Martin who both suffer chronic\nback pain. Mr. Martin feels the pain\nfirst and he decides to go see a doctor\nwho diagnoses osteoporosis and treats\nhim with physiotherapy. After a few days\nof treatment, Mr. Martin feels better. He\nstarts to track the progress of his pain.\nHe soon learns that he always goes to\nthe doctor on the days when the pain is\nthe worst and always feels better soon\nafter. He becomes a big advocate for\nphysiotherapy and recommends it to his\nwife and she joins him. But do we really\nknow that the therapy works? Despite\nmonths of therapy things get worse for\nboth Mr. and Mrs. Martin. Together they\ngo to the hospital where Mr. Martin's\ndoctor prescribes painkillers. Mrs.\nMartin decides to get a second opinion.\nHer new doctor has recently learned that\nfor some chronic pain placebos work\nequally well. Instead of giving Mrs.\nMartin painkillers\nthe doctor prescribes simple sugar pills\nthough he tells Mrs. Martin that they\nare pain killers.\nThe next day they both feel much better.\nMr. Martin notices that he has no\nproblem sawing wood and Mrs. Martin can\neasily put on her shoes. She can confirm\nthat the painkillers work but do they\nreally? Unfortunately, it doesn't take\nlong before the pain comes back and they\nreturn to the hospital.\nMr. Martin is now treated with\nvertebroplasty, a popular treatment\noffered to people who suffer from back\npain due to osteoporosis. To administer\nit the doctors inject cement directly\ninto his vertebrae, the bones that form\nthe spinal column. Mrs. Martin's doctor\nsimply has her smell a container full of\ncement and then administers a saline\ninjection, which does nothing.\nHer doctor learned about this placebo\nfrom research published in the U.S.\nNational Library of Medicine. It showed\nthat a large randomized controlled trial\nfound no benefit of vertebroplasty over\na sham procedure. Right after the surgery\nthe Martin's meet in the lobby and share\ntheir experience of the process: both\nfeel great! Mrs. Martin invites her\nhusband for ice cream as her treatment\nwas so much cheaper. So what's happening\nhere? There are a couple of theories that\ntry to explain the placebo effect. First\nthere is regression to the mean: Mr.\nMartin like most of us thinks about\ntreatment when his symptoms are\nparticularly bad. He goes to see a doctor\nand soon after feels better. If we look\nat the natural course of many illnesses\nwe understand that pain, over time, comes\nand goes in swings and usually regresses\nto the mean. We don't know if the doctor\nor placebo had anything to do with the\nimprovement.\nThen there is classical conditioning:\nmost treatments, including vertebroplasty,\nare delivered in a context of rituals\nthat include social signals, physical\ncues, and verbal suggestions. Mr. Martin's\nbrain interprets such cues and elicits\nexpectations memories and emotions, it\nreleases endorphins and other chemicals\nthat make him feel good and lower his\nperception of pain. So it becomes a\nself-fulfilling prophecy where a belief\nthat he feels better leads him to feel\nbetter. And there is confirmation bias: as\nsoon as Mrs. Martin takes the sugar pill\nshe thinks she will feel better. Then she\nfocuses only on the things that confirm\nthat she is better. She doesn't realize\nthat she still has trouble doing many\nother things. While all three ideas\nprobably work together there is another \ntheory: so-called mirror neurons might\nalso play a role. A new and growing body\nof evidence points at brain cells that\nmirror behavior. The cells fire when one\nacts and when one observes the same\naction performed by another. As Mrs.\nMartin talks to the doctor parts of the\ndoctors brain will mirror parts of her\nbrain and parts of her brain will mirror\nhis, as a result, the structure of her\nbrain changes and she feels less pain.\nThe neurophysiologist Giacomo Rizzolatti\nwho discovered mirror neurons suggests\nthat this process bypasses consciousness\nand provides a direct mapping of sensory\ninformation onto motor structures.\nPlacebo, a Latin word that means \"I will\nplease\", have been used for thousands of\nyears. Placebo effects have been\ndiscussed for centuries. An influential\nstudy from 1955 by Henry Kay Beecher,\nHarvard, titled: the powerful placebo\nestablished the idea that the effect is\nclinically important. Today the placebo\neffect is well recognized and\nscientifically so significant that any\nnew pain medication that seeks Food and\nDrug Administration approval in the\nUnited States needs to show that it\nworks better than a placebo treatment. In\nso-called randomized controlled trials,\nthe gold standard of medical research,\none group of patients is given the new\nmedication while a control group receives\na placebo.\nNeither the doctors who hand out the\nmedication nor the patients know who\ngets what. Once the trial is over results\nare compared. If the new medication works\nsignificantly better than the placebo it's\nallowed to be sold. The trial is\nsurprisingly difficult from 10 new drugs\nentering the test one gets approval. If a\nplacebo study proves that an existing\nstandard medical procedure is\nineffective, like in the case of\nvertebroplasty, competent doctors stop\nprescribing it and we can speak of\nmedical reversal. To find out if an\nexisting treatment works or if it's\nhealing power is just the result of the\nplacebo effect we can administer\ntreatment without the knowledge of the\npatients. In one such experiment it was\nshown that if a painkiller is\nadministered by a hidden robot pump,\npatients demanded twice the dose\ncompared to when the drug is injected by\na nurse. This would suggest that if a\npatient is completely unaware that\ntreatment is being given, the treatment\nis just half as effective. The placebo\neffect counts for the other half.\nHonest placebo studies go even further.\nBecause deception is ethically\nquestionable researchers have now\nstarted to do clinical trials in which\npeople are told that all they get is a\nsugar pill with placebo printed all over\nthe packaging. And even then the placebo\neffect does it's magic and helps you\nfeel better.\nOne experiment at the Harvard Medical\nSchool showed that people suffering from\nirritable bowel syndrome who were taking\nthe honest placebo doubled their rate of\nimprovement compared to the control\ngroup. What do you think? How can we make\nsure that the medicine we are\nprescribing is not only effective thanks\nto the placebo effect? Will more placebo\nresearch reveal that many standard\nmedical treatments offered in some of\nthe best hospitals around the world are\nshams? And how can we research the power\nof placeboes ourselves, at home, without\nputting anyone in danger?\nIf you like this video and the way we\nexplain the subject subscribe to our\nchannel!
