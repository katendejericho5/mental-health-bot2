    "transcript": "Bloom's Taxonomy is a toolbox that\nteachers or students can use to classify\nand organize learning objectives. It's\nmost popular version is based on the\ncognitive domain and assumes that\nlearning should be structured from easy\nto difficult in the following six steps:\nOne: remember. Two: understand. Three: apply.\nFour: analyze. Five evaluate. Six: create On\nthe first level we learn to remember.\nThere is just rote memorization and\nrecollection of facts without much\nunderstanding, for example if we learn\nabout lemons we want to remember the\nname, shape, color, size and that they are\nsour\nonce we memorise these essentially\nmeaningless facts we move to the second\nlevel of learning. On level two we learn\nto understand. We begin to decode\ninformation and learn that a lemon is\nyellow when it's ripe to eat and if we\ntake a bite that it's really super sour,\nwe also understand that lemons love\nsunshine and that they contain lots of\nvitamin C which is a great natural\nantioxidant that keeps us healthy. Now as\nwe really understand a lemon we can work\nwith it. On the third level we apply what\nwe know. We've understood that while\nlemons are sour they are also a great\nprovider of vitamin C. To apply this\nknowledge in a meaningful way we could\nboil a lemon into hot water and add some\nhoney, then serve this hot lemon to our\nsick sister who's in need of treatment.\nOn the 4th level we learn to analyse,\nthis involves examining and breaking\ndown information into components\ndetermining how the parts relate to one\nanother and finding evidence to support\ngeneralisations. We study the lemon flesh,\nexamine the skin and look at levels of\nvitamins. We conclude that we can eat\neverything inside while the skin tastes\nbitter and contains traces of toxic\npesticides it ought not to be consumed.\nNow we are ready to evaluate, we analyse,\ncritique and compare. To evaluate our\nlemon as a good source of vitamins we\ncompare it to other sources such as\noranges and supplements. We look at the\nfollowing properties: vitamin levels,\naffordability, taste and packaging waste.\nIf we evaluate our thoughts critically\nand without bias we learn where the\nlemons score high and where others score\nhigher. Now after we have learned,\nunderstood. applied, analysed and\nevaluated, we are ready to create. As we\nnow really understand lemons also in\ncomparison to similar things we can\nformulate a plan to create our own\nnatural lemonate. It's now easy to come\nup with a cute shop design a good name\nand a good slogan: \"natural, healthy, yummy\"\nBloom's Taxonomy was first created in\n1946 by American psychologist Benjamin\nBloom. The revised version from 2001, as\njust presented, serves as the backbone of\nmany teaching philosophies in particular\nthose that aim towards teaching specific\nskills. Each level usually comes with a\nclear learning objective that can be\ntested. Critics of the taxonomy often\nquestioned the existence of a sequential\nhierarchical link between each level.\nWhat are your thoughts?
