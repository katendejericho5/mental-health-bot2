    "video_title": "Carl Jungâ€™s Theory on Introverts, Extraverts, and Ambiverts",
    "transcript": "Introversion and extraversion are terms\nfirst coined by psychiatrist Carl Gustav Jung\nin Switzerland in the 1920s\naccording to Jung an extravert seeks\nintensive contact with the outside world\nan introvert instead turns the psychic\nenergy inwards. Jung believed that no one\nis a hundred percent extravert or a\nhundred percent introvert instead we\ncarry both traits\nhowever most minds tend to lean either\nto one side or the other.\nIf both characteristics are equally\npresent we can speak of someone who has\nan ambivert personality. In the 1960s the\npsychologist Hans Eysenck added to Carl\nJung's ideas.He argued that the main\ndifference between introverts and\nextraverts lies in the way they gain and\nrecharge their mental energy. By Nature,\nintroverted people have a higher level\nof brain activity and therefore feel a\ngreater need to shield themselves from\nexternal stimuli. By withdrawing\nthemselves they gain mental energy. The\nneuronal activity of extraverts is lower.\nThey overcome this lack by exposing\nthemselves to external stimulation this\ncharges their inner batteries. To\nillustrate the difference let's compare\ntwo imaginary children: Jay is\nextraverted. He loves to be surrounded by\nclassmates. He enjoys being the center of\nattention and loves to talk to his\nbuddies about all kinds of stuff.\nHe organizes football games with\nstrangers and right after is open to\nplaying ping-pong with someone else.\nBy seeking social stimuli he gains mental\nenergy. Ann is introverted. As others play\naround in the park, she often enjoys\nsitting alone watching. At home, she\nplants herbs in the garden, all by\nherself. She slowly becomes a real expert\nin this field but that's her secret.\nTo recharge her batteries Ann needs peace and quiet time.\nIntroverts are not necessarily shy, even\nif it appears they like to\nwalk away from small talk. Ann in fact is not shy at all. She is not afraid to talk to anyone,\nnot even seniors. When too many people are around and the conversations\nbecome superficial or confusing she gets\nsuper tired. Her strategy is to fade out\nand go inside herself to recharge\nthrough silence. Jay loves to have many\npeople around him, to jump from one\nconversation to the next stimulates him.\nSome experts claim that extraverts and\nintroverts use different brain areas to\nform their thoughts. An extravert tends\nto use short term memory and therefore\nis able to come to fast associations Jay\ntherefore talks fast and a lot.\nHe appears smart because his brain always offers an answer quickly.\nHowever he often speaks before he thinks\nand later changes his mind.\nSomeone like Ann works with her brain to\ncarefully retrieve information from her\nlong-term memory. Her thoughts are more\ncomplex and hence need more time to\ndevelop. She therefore thinks first and\nthen speaks. If the two were asked for\ndirections by a tourist Ann would spend\ntime thinking about the best answer\nwhile Jay would have already come up\nwith different kinds of options.\nGood teachers and clever business leaders\nknow about the different nature of\nintroverts and extraverts and try to\ndevelop their strengths. When raising\nquestions they ask everyone to think for\na minute in silence before answering.\nExtraverts then learn to formalize their\nthoughts before they speak and\nintroverts get more talking time to\npractice public speaking.\nAt brainstorming they use a formal process\nor a talking stick to make sure an Ann\nalso gets to participate.\nGroup projects can be formalized to\nsupport both temperaments. In one project\nextraverts and introverts work together.\nJay then learns from Ann how to think\nideas over to develop more complex\nthoughts. Ann in return benefits from\nJay's fast association skills and learns\nto think and speak more flexibly. In the\nnext project the same temperaments work\ntogether. Then they see their own traits\nin the opposite person. If confronted\nwith problems in teams of the same\ncharacter introverts need to speak up\nand extraverts are forced to think deep\nto proceed. The educator Rudolf Steiner\nwas a proponent of this method for his\nWaldorf schools. Psychologist Jerome\nKagan's research on temperament in\nToddlers showed that many character\ntraits we are born with make it into\nadulthood. He confronted 500 babies with\ndifferent stimuli like loud sounds and\nbad smells. Around 20% of the babies\ncried or got nervous,\n40% stayed relaxed and the other 40%\nwere somewhere in between. A second test\nyears later showed, that babies who\ndidn't react strongly turned out to be\nmore extraverted. What about yourself? Do\nyou consider yourself more introverted\nor extraverted? Or do you think this\nclassification is flawed and there is no\nsuch thing?
