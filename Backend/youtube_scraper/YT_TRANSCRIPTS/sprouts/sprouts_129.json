    "transcript": "to play an instrument can communicate\nour feelings and bring joy to others to\npractice allows yourself to take a break\nand dive into a new world if we do that\nwith others we learn to understand the\ntrue value of teamwork for the\ndevelopment of our brain it's fantastic\nresearcher and Nita Collins explains how\nplaying an instrument involves almost\nall brain areas at the same time it\ntrains the visual auditory and motor\nskills and engages our emotions it gets\nmillions of neurotransmitters together\nthat then go out to build new synapses\nthat not only help your eyes ears and\nhands but also all other areas to\nprosper to our brain it's like a\nfirework of learning and development but\nthere are more reasons why it's so\nuseful practicing an instrument teaches\nus that we get better with training and\nwhen we play something wrong we get\ninstant feedback either by hearing it or\nby someone in our band we learned the\nvalue of feedback adapt our playing and\nget better a lesson that we can apply to\nother aspects of life top performers\nusually start early as a kid pianist\nLang Lang played around eight hours\nevery day the Academy of Music in Berlin\nknows that at the age of twenty their\ntop violin students have practiced\naround 10,000 hours each but it's not\nonly the amount of hours violinist\nLeopold our famously said practice with\nyour fingers and you need all day\npractice with your mind and you will do\nas much in one and a half hours here are\na few ideas practice slow and mindful\nyou should train slow and with full\nfocus if you practice too fast\nyou risk internalizing mistakes and\nbecoming great at playing poorly once\nyou can play well slowly raise the tempo\ngradually if you are tired or unfocused\ntake a break and relax otherwise you\nmight learn new mistakes for\nthat you have played well earlier keep\nit interesting it is important that you\nare not bored from your own practice so\ntry to make it as interesting as\npossible approach each practice like an\nadventure to learn something new about\nthe music about your own body or the\ninstrument you may one day play quiet\nand melancholic melodies while the next\nday play something more upbeat and\npowerful practice hard parts first your\nattention is strongest at the beginning\nof each session it's then that you are\nmost likely to succeed once you are\ncomfortable with the hard part repeat it\nplay around or practice something easy\nyou also can try to play the part\nbackwards and very eight rhythms and\ntempo until the notes become your best\nfriends\n[Music]\nimagine throughout your practice try to\nstay in contact with the music one way\nis to use imagination to make the music\nalive you can think about music like the\nvoices of people talking when one takes\na break the other gets louder to show\nemotions think about a dance a river\nfloating or a bird singing a solo which\npart of your piece will be accompanied\nby a violin and which by the flute maybe\nthe most important idea is what we call\nprocess learning to get good at anything\nwe cannot just focus on the results but\nwe also should enjoy the path it takes\nto get there let's try to make each step\non this path meaningful whether you join\na fun jam session or challenge someone\nin a rap battle if you enjoy the process\nyou might one day even go on stage if\nthat's what you want some of us just\nwant to learn listen and dance\n[Music]"
