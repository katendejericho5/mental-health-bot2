    "video_title": "Positive and Negative Liberty [Shorts version]",
    "transcript": "Freedom often means to think and \nact without restraint, however,  \nliving in a society the freedom of one can affect \nthe freedom of another and that's a problem.\nAnd so we create rules that \nlimit some individual freedoms  \nto make other individual liberties possible.\nPhilosopher, Isaiah Berlin hence \nspeaks of two types of liberty;  \nbetween negative liberty and positive liberty.\nSupporters of negative liberty \ntend to sympathize with classical  \nlibertarian thoughts. They think of the state as \na coercive force that limits individual freedom  \nand prefer a small government \nwith few taxes and regulations.\nAdvocates of positive liberty tend to identify as \nsocial liberals. They usually want a big welfare  \nstate that ensures a fair redistribution of \nwealth and provides equal access to opportunities."
