    "transcript": "Benjamin Franklin apparently said.\n\"Tell me and I forget.\"\n\"Teach me and I remember.\"\n\"Involve me and I learn.\"\nBut what do we REALLY know about\neffective learning hundred years later?\nMany respected economists and educators\nfrom the world's leading universities\nresearched this topic.\nThey discovered that many things don’t matter,\nsuch as classroom size, new technology,\nor fancy uniforms.\nTheir evidence\nsuggests that the secret to thriving students\nare amazing teachers.\nHere's what they have learned.\nFirst we have to acknowledge that teaching\nis a highly complex skill.\nIt involves a deep understanding of the subject matter\nand the ability to explain complex\nissues in simple ways.\nBut it also requires an understanding of psychology,\npedagogy, as well as a wide range of management\nskills in order to get the student's first\nquiet and then excited.\nRob Coe, Professor at Durham University\nreported that many widely used methods don’t work:\nfor example grouping students by ability,\ngiving unearned praise,\nor the idea that students can discover complex\nconcepts by themselves.\nInstead, master instructors have high exceptions\nand maximize the lesson time.\nBut most importantly,\nthey combine high quality instruction\nwith pedagogical content knowledge.\nThey don’t teach a subject,\nthey teach their students\nhow to learn it for themselves.\nIn order to get it right,\nwe have to treat and train teachers like brain surgeons.\nAfter all they also operate on human brains.\nLike aspiring doctors,\nthey are best trained in the field\nwhere they receive professional\nfeedback when they made mistakes.\nEffective schools of education therefore,\ntrain teaching like a craft,\nrather than an abstract science.\nAt Sposato, a Graduate School of Education known\nfor creating effective teachers,\nstudents spend a lot of their time\ntutoring or assisting professionals.\nTeachers who are already in the classroom,\nneed regular professional feedback on the job.\nA vast study by Roland Fryer from Harvard\nfound that teachers who receive\nprecise instructions together with specific regular\nfeedback from a lead teacher,\nwill improve the most.\nOther good ideas to improve teachers\nare to ask the students for feedback\nor to record lessons on video\nand let the teachers watch themselves.\nDoug Lemov, founder of UnCommon Schools\nand author of Teach Like A Champion,\nidentified many methods that great teachers use:\nthey greet each student\nat the door so students feel welcomed\nand acknowledged of their existence.\nLater they use a strong voice\nand don’t stop talking\nuntil they have everyone’s attention.\nPlus, they teach for mastery learning\nto ensure students get it 100%\nright before they proceed.\nBut maybe most importantly,\ngreat teachers first get their students excited\nand then keep their attention through story-telling\nand engaging activities that sparks their imaginations.\nA paper published by Stanford in 2009\nshowed that leadership makes a big difference too.\nAt low performing schools,\nprincipals hardly ever show up in the classrooms,\nbut instead spend most of their time on administration,\ndocuments or finance.\nSchools with better students,\nhave principals that get out of their office\nand spend a lot of time in the classrooms,\nsupervising and developing the teachers.\nTogether, they can make a big different\nin their students life\nEconomist Raj Chetty and his team,\nanalyzed the data of 2.5 million US students\nand 18 million test results.\nHe thinks that instructors\nwho are good at teaching to the test,\nhave a big impact.\nOn average, having such a teacher for just ONE year,\nraises the students test scores\nand cumulative lifetime income by 14,500 - in\n2011 dollars.\nOn early childhood education,\nhe has another hypothesis:\nGreat kindergarten teachers\nhelp to develop social skills,\ndiscipline and character.\nTheir impact does not improve test scores\nduring the school years,\nbut surprisingly reemerges years later,\nwhen their former students apply those skills\nto advance in their careers\nand find meaningful and well-paying jobs.\nEric Hanushek, Professor at Stanford University,\ncomputed how much good teachers really matter.\nHe found out that top teachers get students to learn\n50% more each year than an average instructor.\nPoorly trained ones, just half of the average.\nThat means that 10 years at school\ncan either result in 15 years of actual learning\nor just a mere 5 years.\nThis is a massive difference\nthat mainly hurts children from low-income families\nwho can't afford extra classes\nor changing to a better school.\nAmerican novelist Gail Godwin once wrote:\n\"good teaching is one-fourth preparation\"\n\"and three-fourths pure theatre.\"\nTo see a great actors in action\nwatch Michael Sandel from Harvard teach Law,\nRobert Sapolsky from Stanford teach Behavioral Biology,\nWalter Michel from MIT teach Physics\nor Mr. Hester managing a classroom of teenagers.\nLinks are in the description below\nand other great instructors in our channel playlists.\nNow please share YOUR favorite teachers\nin the comments below!"
