    "transcript": "Deliberate practice is a mindful and highly structured\nform of learning by doing.\nIt’s a process of continued experimentation\nto first achieve mastery and eventually full\nautomaticity of a specific skill.\nA 2014 study published in Psychological Science\nargues that it can increase our performance\nby 26% in games, 21% in music and 18% in sports.\nHere are some tips on how to do it well.\nDefine Success and Drill Deliberately\nDefine all the elements you need to practice\nto become successful.\nThen drill each element deliberately,\none after the other.\nIn Tennis, that could be first your serves\nand then later your leg work.\nIf you want to become a professional barista,\nfirst perfect your moves to make the espresso,\nthen your skills to serve the ideal coffee.\nPlan, Reflect and Take Notes\nPlan out your practice routine,\nfor example in a notebook.\nAfter each session,\nreflect and write down what you've discovered:\nWhat worked?\nWhat didn’t?\nThe idea is to get a clear sense\nof how a particular session improves your skills\nand then to experiment to find new and ever better way\nto achieve your goals.\nGo Slow\nTo build a good foundation of muscle memory,\npractice slow and correctly.\nIf we move too fast,\nwe risk learning and internalizing the wrong skills,\nwhich can bring terrible consequences.\nTo achieve mastery, our brain needs time to develop.\nSo start slow and then gradually increase the speed\nuntil you give all you've got .\nLimit Your Sessions to Focus\nDeliberate practice is hard metal work.\nLimit the sessions to a reasonable duration\nthat allows you to stay focused.\nThis may be 15 minutes if you are younger\nand 60 minutes if you are older.\nA Cristiano Ronaldo\ntrains around 3-4 hours of football a day.\nYoung Shaolin Monks practice 2 hours in the morning\nand two hours in the afternoon,\nTo keep their attention high,\nthey switch the style of practice every 10 minutes.\nMaximize Practice Time\nLegendary basketball coach John Wooden\nused to let each of his players\npractice putting on socks and shoes\nso that they learn to do it really fast.\nBy doing this, he maximized the time\nto practice throwing the ball\nand discussing game strategy with his team.\nTrack Small Intervals of Improvement\nIf you practice running 800 meters,\ncount the milliseconds not the minutes.\nIf you are working out or practice controlling your diet,\nmeasure milligrams and millimeters.\nThe smaller the data points you measure,\nthe faster you see progress\nand the more you feel motivated to continue.\nEmulate Practice, Not Performance\nThe top performance we see on screens or on stage\nis the results of endless hard work behind the curtain.\nIf you want to become as good as Pavarotti in the Opera\nor as skillful as Messi with the ball,\ndon’t watch them perform,\nstudy how they practice.\nRepetition Makes Perfect\nIn the 1990s, a team of German psychologists\nrevealed that it takes 10,000 hours of deliberate practice\nto become a professional violinist.\nA similar study concluded it also takes almost\njust as long to become a great cigar maker.\nNew workers in a cuban cigar factory\ntake around 25 seconds to make one cigar.\nAfter 100,000 repetitions, it takes them just 15 seconds\nand after 1 million only 8.\nTo reach peak performance,\nit takes 7 years and 10 million repetitions of\nthe same hand movements.\nNot practice, but repetition makes perfect.\nProfessional football teams therefore play daily\nwhat the Spanish players call \"Rondo\".\nPiano players warm-up with Scales and Arpeggios.\nRoutine Is Everything\nTo reach mastery, Young Shaolin Monks\nget up at 5:30AM.\nThen chant, eat breakfast\nand practice two hours of kung fu.\nAt 11:30 they have a vegetarian lunch\nwith no liquids to aid digestion.\nAt around 3PM, they practice another two hours.\nAt 5:30 is dinner,\nfollowed by chanting.\nAt 8 meditation.\nAt 10 time for bed.\nUs normal people can start with 15 Minutes every day\nand then slowly increase our session.\nGet a Coach\nThe job of a coach is to show us our true potential\nand then guide us in the right direction.\nIf you don’t have a coach, look for one.\nIt can a teacher, a friend\nor even someone you find or follow online.\nFor our favorite teachers and coaches,\nvisit our sprouts channel page\nand check out our playlists.\nThe Dalai Lama believes deliberate practice\nnot only works for muscles,\nbut also for our mind.\nHe and other wise minds\ndeliberately practice taking other people's anger,\nsuspicion and mistrust\nand then giving them patience,\ntolerance and compassion in return.\nWhat do you think about deliberate practice,\ncan we also use it for training our thinking skills?\nShare your thoughts in the comments below!"
