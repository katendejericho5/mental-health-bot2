    "transcript": "A learning organization \nencourages personal mastery\nand cultivates open feedback\nto see problems and opportunities on all levels.\nSome argue that learning organizations\nattract and retain more talents.\nOthers say that there is a \ncompetitive advantage for\nan organization whose people learn faster\nthan the people of other organizations.\nHere are 6 characteristics most have in common.\nThey Cherish: An Open Culture.\nLearning organizations encourage \neveryone to share information,\nadmit to mistakes and practice\ngiving and taking constructive criticism.\nOnce the problem is found,\nthey try to understand its root cause and fix it.\nTo achieve such a culture: walls are removed,\ninformation is shared and \nleaders show their human sides.\nThey Design and Implement: Feedback Loops\nSome establish 360 degrees surveys,\nin which people assess themselves, \ntheir peers and their bosses.\nEmployees at 5-star hotels \nask guests for their opinions.\nTop schools may videotape teachers\nso they can later study themselves.\nSome even make feedback a team effort.\nBefore any new project, they all \nget together to kick things off.\nAfter the project they meet again to share\nand reflect on what has happened.\nThey Promote: Personal Mastery\nEmployees try to achieve \npersonal mastery in their fields.\nOnce they become experts,\nthey feel proud of their work,\nthey are motivated intrinsically\nand they can create positive \nchange wherever they are.\nFor example, a cleaner might come \nup with an idea on how to save water\nand an accountant on how to save bank fees.\nThe job of the boss is to connect \nall experts and give directions.\nThey Plan for: Intelligent Fast Failure.\nWhen they build something new,\nthey don’t spend time to \nmake assumptions on paper.\nInstead, they create what’s \ncalled Minimum Viable Product,\na simple prototype with only the core functions.\nThis is then presented to \nusers as early as possible\nto test what they think.\nBecause it is imperfect,\neven friends give their honest opinions.\nThe goal: fail fast, but \ncollect intelligent information\nso you can improve while going forward.\nThey Steal: Best Practices\nPicasso apparently said that\n\"good artists borrow, great artists steal\".\nLearning organizations study others,\nsteal best practices and then implement them fast.\nThe newspaper The Economists \ntook advice from George Orwell;\nits editors never use jargon\nif everyday English works.\nPrinting manufacturers stole the razor-and-blades\nbusiness model from Gillette,\nselling printers cheap but ink expensive.\nThey Cultivate: A Common Vision\nA learning organization prospers when \nall members share a common vision.\nThat way employees can understand\nthe importance of their role,\nconnect the dots and develop systems thinking.\nWhen goals are clear,\nregulations can be reduced\nand people can create their own \npersonal benchmarks of success.\nThis reduces bureaucracy, \nauthority and corruption.\nSalesmen and author Zig Ziglar once wrote:\n\"the only thing worse than training \npeople and having them leave,\"\n\"is not training them and having them stay.\"\nAt a learning organization\neducation happens as a \nside-product of working together,\nas everybody learns from each other\nto adapt to whatever the future might bring.\nIf you like our videos and \nwant to support our channel,\nvisit us at Patreon.com/Sprouts\nand see if you want to donate just one dollar.\nwith your support, we plan to create many more\nMinuteVideos about learning and education"
