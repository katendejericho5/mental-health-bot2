    "transcript": "Our brain can potentially memorize 2.5 petabytes of information,\nwhich is roughly the equivalent of 3 million hours of YouTube videos.\nIn order to use some of that staggering capacity a little more effectively when you learn,\nhere are some tips that are based on widely accepted research\nby neuroscientists and learning experts.\n“Spaced Repetition\"\nTo maximise your learning, study short but often.\nNeuroscientist proved that synapses,\nthe million billion connections in your brain that make you remember and understand stuff,\ngrow mainly at night when you are asleep.\nThis means that it is more productive to study regularly with sleeping breaks in between.\nTry it!\nPractice something for 15 minutes every day\nand you’ll be surprised by your progress within just weeks.\n“Find Your Own Style”\nWhile listening to the history teacher,\nTom scribbles images and Jane finishes 1 kilo of nuts.\nSome enjoy watching videos over reading books,\nothers study with friends and some like sitting in silence among a million books.\nEverybody is different.\n“Good Night’s Sleep”\nSleep and dreams are vital to processing and storing new information.\nA Harvard study showed that students who had a good night’s sleep\nremembered their study materials\n35% better than those who studied in the morning to take a test in the evening.\n“Focus!”\nIf you tend to procrastinate,\nwhich means that you tend to switch from doing something hard like studying maths\nto something easy like browsing the web,\nprotect yourself from distraction.\nOne way of doing this is to shut down your mobile phone\nor go to a quite place like a library.\n“Pomodoro Technique”\nSet a timer to 25 minutes when you focus entirely on your studies.\nWhen the timer rings, relax for 5 minutes.\nIf you want to continue just set the timer again.\nThe small breaks in between are relaxing and motivating to keep going.\n“Hard Stuff First”\nDo the things that are difficult first.\nBecause if you are like most people,\nyou have the strongest willpower in the morning.\nOnce you are done with the hard stuff\nyou will feel better for the rest of the day\nand probably more motivated to get other things done.\n“Exercise, Meditate and Converse”\nThere are few activities proven to grow your brain\nhowever physical exercise,\nregular meditation\nand good conversations apparently do exactly that.\nThey lead to the creation of new neurons inside your brain\nand therefore grow its potential.\n“Go Places!”\nYou can create deeper memories of a subject\nby learning in a richer environment that offers more visual clues.\nIn an experiment\ntwo groups of students had to remember random words.\nOne group changed the classroom while studying,\nthe other didn’t.\nThe group that studied in two different rooms\n(one was small and windowless, the other big and bright)\nwas 40% more likely to recall the words later.\n“Take Fun Seriously”\nWhatever it is, find a fun way to practice.\nModern learning science believes that positive emotions are very important for increasing your learning potential.\nSo do yourself a favour and have a good time!\n“Space Your Studies”\nIn order to remember things for a longer time,\nrepeat the material in spaced intervals.\nFacts or vocabularies for example\nare best learned if you review them the first time 1-2 days after the initial study\nand then again after 1 week and after 1 month.\n“30% Read 70% Recite”\nIf you have one hour to learn to recite a poem or prepare for a speech\nspend 20 Minutes of the time on studying the text\nand 40 minutes on practicing to recite.\nThis ratio usually leads to the best results.\nIn the case of an emergency,\nput a glass of water next to you.\nTake a sip whenever you lose it ;)\n“Instant Self-Test”\nAfter you study finish up with a quick quiz.\nImmediate recall in form of a test or a short summary on what you’ve just learned\ncan increase retention by as much as 30%.\nBecause it’s much harder for your brain to reflect than to read,\nthat extra effort creates deeper traces in your memory.\n“Don’t Force it”\nMotivation is like hunger.\nYou cannot force yourself to be motivated\njust like you can’t tell someone else to be hungry.\nSo if you are not hungry right now, don’t worry.\nTake a break and do something else."
