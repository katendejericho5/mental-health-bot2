    "transcript": "Learning happens inside our brain\nwhen new information connects \nwith existing memory.\nWhen we are excited or enthusiastic our \nbrain happens to do that much better.\nIn a famous experiment American psychologist \nHans Breiter put cocaine addicts into an MRI.\nThe effect of the drug excited the addicts\nand the researcher saw a lot of activity \nin what’s called the Nucleus Accumbent.\nGerman scientists did the same experiment \nwith young men and pictures of Porsche cars,\nwhich caused the same area to light up.\nWhen they did it with pictures \nof a Daihatsu, it didn’t.\nWhat’s going on here?\nAs soon as we expect something nice to happen,\nthe brain releases it's happiness chemicals\ndopamine and endorphin\nas well as other neurotransmitters.\nWhile dopamine and endorphin delight us,\nthe other neurotransmitters \nsend information from A to B.\nThis connects new information from outside \nthe brain with stored memories inside...\nand that’s learning.\nUnfortunately this doesn’t mean that \neverything “fun” helps us learn.\nShopping for example makes us happy,\nbut as German Neuroscientists \nManfred Spitzer measured,\nit only lasts 12 seconds.\nThen the dopamine level drops\nand we have to shop more to bring it back up.\nThis happens because the brain \nreleases neurotransmitters in  \nanticipation of something nice.\nBut once we get it,\nthe dopamine rush ends and the \ninformation exchange slows.\nAccumulating new things \ntherefore doesn’t make us happy,\nnor does it help us to learn.\nBeing excited about something for a \nlonger time or being surprised does.\nFor example: When we are excited \nto plan a trip with our friends\nor when we have an unexpected and \ninspiring conversation with a stranger,\nour brain releases neurotransmitters in abundance\nand we start recording with all \nour senses in high definition.\nThe synapses add existing \nfootage from the long-term memory\nto make it a creative and memorable experience.\nIt’s like we turn on a learn turbo.\nNeuroscientist Prof. Dr. Hüther\neven argues that young children can learn \nmultiple languages and so many other things,\nmainly because of their ability to be excited.\nAnd most are excited about \neverything until they get held back\nto follow their interest by the \nexpectations of their parents or schools.\nWhen learning a new language in \na boring class at age 35 however,\nwe have little left to be excited about\nand hence we learn next to nothing.\nProf. Hüther believes any 75-year old Chinese man,\nwho falls in love with a young \n65-year old British lady,\nwill speak English very fast.\nIf you are able to constantly learn \nnew things in an exciting way,\nthe chemicals released in your brain are likely \nto outlive the pleasures of drugs or shopping.\nIt seems as if happiness and learning not \nonly come from the same region in our brain,\nbut they also promote one another.\nWhat is your experience?\nIs learning a side product of enthusiasm?\nOr can we learn without passion or interest?\nShare your thoughts in the comment below!"
