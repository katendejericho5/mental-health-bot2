    "transcript": "Tests are meant to measure progress\ntowards gaining practical skills or understanding ideas.\nTheir purpose is to show teachers and students\nwhat went right\nand what went wrong.\nUnfortunately, too many times\nwe fail to act upon what tests find out.\nInstead of fixing the gaps that tests identify,\nstudents are pushed through the school system with\npoor test results and bad grades.\nThe problem is that if we fail to fill these gaps,\nschool can become years of boredom\nand potentially clever kids\nmight lose faith in their own abilities.\nMost Multiple Choice Tests for example\nare designed to reward guessing\ninstead of precision and honesty.\nThey do not give us the option to “not know”.\nWith terrible consequences.\nAfter the test has been taken,\nboth teachers and students\nwon’t know whether the student got it,\nor just guessed it right.\nThis sends the wrong signal\nand we miss the opportunity to fill knowledge gaps.\nMastery Learning,\nan educational philosophy first proposed\nby Benjamin Bloom in 1968, offers a solution.\nUnder Mastery Learning students must achieve \na level of excellence\n(which could be. 90% on a math test)\nbefore moving forward.\nIf students do not achieve mastery on the test,\nthey go back to study and then get tested again.\nThis cycle continues until the student gets it right.\nOnly then may they move on to learn the next thing.\nIn 2011 the Khan Academy,\na non-profit organisation,\nand the Los Altos school district\nshowed that great things happen\nif math students advance\nonly if they fully understand a concept.\nSix months into the experiment of passing only students\nthat fully mastered a concept,\nthe number of advanced math students doubled\nand 6% of the weakest group\njoined those at the very top.\nWhat do you think?\nDoes it make sense to teach a student\nwho doesn’t understand 8 times 3 equals 24,\nhow one sixth of 24 equals 4?\nIt's almost like saying:\nyou don’t know how to swim in a pool?\nwhat the heck try and jump into that river!\nEnlighten us with your perspective\nor share relevant links on this topic\nin the comments below!"
