    "transcript": "At school,\ntests and grades are meant to show our progress\ntowards gaining practical skills\nor understanding complicated ideas.\nUnfortunately, they often measure the wrong thing\nor a limited form of progress.\nAlbert Einstein said,\n“Any fool can know. The point is to understand”.\nAnd he was right.\nThere is no point in knowing what a solar panel is\nif we don’t know why it was built or how to install it.\nToo often, tests focus on the what,\nrather than the more important questions of\nhow or why.\nMultiple Choice is especially tricky.\nGovernments and schools love it\nbecause you can compute the results fast and cheap.\nUnfortunately, Multiple Choice\ndoes not measure for creativity\nor original thoughts.\nAs long as test scores assess\nonly one very limited form of understanding,\nthere will be parents and teachers\nthat push children to focus on the wrong things:\nfacts for example.\nAs long as kids have to study subjects\nnot aligned with their personal interest\n- boredom,\nconfusion or low self-confidence will prevail.\nPsychologist Angela Duckworth says character,\nperseverance and mindset\nmake all the difference in school,\nwork and life;\nshe calls it ‘grit’.\nFamous neuroscientists Manfred Spitzer\nargues the most important subjects to become\ngood at anything include music,\nhandcrafting, and drama,\nwhich are difficult to measure with tests.\nSome top schools already focus on mindset\nor teach theatre.\nIn the west,\nMontessori and Waldorf schools\nhelp children to develop practical,\ncreative and social skills\nwhilst grades matter little.\nIn East Asia,\nthere’s a new breed of Buddhists schools\nthat focus on character,\nempathy,\nawareness and mindset.\nWhat do you think?\nIs it an accident that the visionary founders of Google,\nWikipedia and Amazon all went to Montessori,\na school that doesn't use grades?"
