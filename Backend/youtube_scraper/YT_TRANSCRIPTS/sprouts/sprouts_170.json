    "video_title": "Focused vs Diffused Thinking: Solve Hard Problems with this Simple Trick",
    "transcript": "The basic idea is that we have two \nways of learning new information,\nwe have focused and diffused thinking.\nPing Pong explains how to switch between focused\nand diffused thinking in order to increase\nyour understanding and get creative.\nWearing tiny shorts and grunting is optional.\nFocused learning works by looking at a problem set\nand trying really hard to get it.\nIt’s about actively using \nevery ounce of mental force\nto understand the problem that is in front of us.\nIt’s like seeing a brick wall and reasoning,\n“It’s too hard to just run \nthrough and too tall to climb.”\nDiffused learning is just letting \nyour mind wander without a plan.\nIt can deepen your understanding\nor trigger new creative thoughts.\nWith diffused learning your mind might say,\n“Hey, why don’t we tie a bunch of \nballoons together and just float over it?”\nBoth processes are important to maximize\nyour understanding of a problem you’re facing.\nTo truly optimize your learning,\nplay ping pong between the two:\nfocus, relax, focus, relax, focus, relax,…\nThe best practice is to first \nfocus all your attention,\nideally shutting off any distractions\nlike your phone and other noise.\nAfter doing this for a while\n(a timer can be used)\ndeliberately stop to focus and \nlet your mind freely wander.\nThis is when the brain connects\nwhat you just focused on\nwith other information stored in your memory,\nwhich leads to deeper thinking,\nbetter retention\nand allows for creative thoughts to happen.\nPainter Salvador Dali was \nusing the ping pong technique.\nAfter a round of focused work,\nDali sat on his arm-chair to think and doze off.\nIn one hand he held a big key\nand the moment he fell asleep the key dropped.\nThe sound of the key woke him\nand he would go back to the canvas \nto continue his focused work.\nSteve Jobs broke up his daily thinking routine\nby going out for long walks.\nThe ping pong technique can \nbe useful to study for tests.\nStart with the most difficult problem,\nonce you get stuck, switch to a more simple one.\nWhile doing the easier problem,\nyour brain will keep the difficult \nproblem in its working memory.\nWithout conscious thought,\nyour brain will look for connections\nand try to make sense of the initial,\nmore difficult problem.\nOnce you are done with the easy problem,\ngo back to the difficult one.\nMaybe it wasn’t as difficult as you thought?\nPlease use the comment section below\nto let us know if you find this technique useful\nand subscribe to our YouTube \nchannel to receive updates."
