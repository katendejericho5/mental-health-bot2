    "video_title": "The Classroom Pledge: Teaching Democracy in School",
    "transcript": "In this video we explore \nhow to turn classroom rules\ninto a classroom pledge\nthat your students want to follow.\nThe idea is to get your \nstudents to help write the rules\nin the form of a classroom pledge.\nThis gives them ownership of the classroom rules\nand encourages them to help each other behave.\nDivide your whiteboard into two\nand ask your students to brainstorm ideas\nabout good classroom behavior\nand how they should treat each other.\nWrite their ideas down on one side of the board\nand repeat this process for \nthings they shouldn’t do.\nIf you have young students who can’t read,\ntry having them draw pictures as \npart of the brainstorming process.\nIf any important social skills are missing,\ngive your students a hint or help them find it.\nThen have them help combine \nsimilar ideas on both sides.\nBe sure to thank them and give \nthem praise for their ideas.\nYour goal is to reinforce positive behavior.\nWith these two lists write your classroom pledge.\nFor example:\n“In Room 314 we are always kind,\nlisten to our teacher,\nask a lot of questions and help each other.\nWe don’t say or do things that hurt\nor take without asking.\nWe are here to learn and do our best!”\nSpeak out your pledge together once a day\nand your students will want to help each other\nfollow their very own classroom rules\n- If you have your own ideas \non how to improve the classroom\nplease let us know in the comments\nand please post your own versions \nof the classroom pledge :)\nWe’re releasing updates regularly,\nso don’t forget to subscribe to our channel.\nThank you for watching!"
