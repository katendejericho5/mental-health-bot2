    "transcript": "Teaching for Mastery Learning means\nthat teachers only move on to the next subject\nonce everyone has mastered a current unit.\nIn other words, there’s no “good enough” - only “perfect”!\nTraditionally we set a fixed amount of time\nto study a unit and allow for flexible outcomes.\nFor example,\n1 year of basic algebra returns students with grades from A to F.\nTeaching for Mastery turns this around.\nAll students attain an A even if it requires more than a year.\nFor example,\na math teacher ensures that everybody knows\nhow to compute addition (7+3)\nbefore going on to more difficult units,\nsuch as multiplication (3*7) or division (7/3).\nThis prevents growing knowledge gaps\nand increases unity among classmates with no one left behind.\nTeaching for mastery demands perfection.\nIf you ask “at what temperature does water start boiling?”\ndon’t accept “One Hundred”.\nDig deeper until the student replies that\n“The boiling point of water depends on the atmospheric pressure,\nwhich changes according to elevation.\nAt sea level it is 100°C\nbut it boils at a lower temperature in higher altitudes”.\nTeaching for mastery requires clear learning goals,\ndetailed tracking of students’ progress\nand diverse opportunities to catch up for those who fall behind.\nSome schools even re-organize classes by the students’ level of understanding instead of age.\nIf you are interested to learn more about this method\nplease checkout the links in the description\nand let us know in the comments how you can see it applied in class.\nThe KahnAcademy.org features great examples\non how to set clear learning goals\nwith it’s knowledge map and study videos for students who need to catch up.\nWe’re releasing videos regularly so don’t forget to subscribe\nand like us on facebook. Thank you for watching."
