    "transcript": "Project-based learning is a pedagogical \napproach that involves students in a long-term,  \nin-depth investigation of a real-world challenge.\nThe benefits of project-based learning \ninclude high engagement and a greater  \ndepth of understanding. They practice \ncommunication, critical thinking,  \nand creativity, and as a result, often \nexperience better learning outcomes in general.\nRandomized controlled trials involving \nthousands of students demonstrated that  \nproject-based learning significantly \noutperformed traditional curricula,  \nraising academic performance \nacross academic disciplines.\nThe best teachers often combine projects with \ntraditional instruction or run what's known  \nas active learning classrooms. So that \nstudents get to make sense of trying,  \nfailing, doing, and the theory from the educator."
