    "transcript": "Around age 9 to 13, girls enter \npuberty and have their very first  \nperiod. From this day forward, \ntheir hormone levels fluctuate,  \naffecting their body, brain and behavior — \na phenomenon known as the menstrual cycle.\nThe menstrual cycle is divided into 4 \nphases: Menstruation, follicular phase,  \novulation with a fertile window, and the \nluteal phase. The length of the cycle is,  \non average, 28 days. However, for most \nwomen it ranges somewhere between 22 and  \n35 days and can be regular or not.\nSince menstruation is a consequence  \nof changes that happen before it, we will \nstart our story with the follicular phase.\nDuring the Follicular phase, the hormone estrogen \nincreases steadily and Leah starts to feel happy,  \nis physically stronger, and \nis generally on top form.\nInside her body, her uterine lining \nstarts to thicken and in the ovaries,  \nher follicles mature. Inside one of \nthem is a tiny cell that's about to  \nbecome an egg. At the end of this phase, \nLeah notices a change in her discharge.\nDuring Ovulation the ovary releases the egg, \nwhich makes its way towards the uterus and then  \nimplants itself inside the lining. For about \n5 days, Leah could potentially get pregnant.\nThe high levels of estrogen make Leah more \ninterested in boys than she used to be,  \nwhich is why she is more conscious \nabout her appearance. Her senses are  \nheightened and she hears, sees, \ntastes and smells more acutely.\nIn the Luteal phase, her body temperature \nrises slightly. Leah has more sensitive,  \nswollen breasts, and occasional joint \npain, which makes skateboarding harder.\nLike just about every other woman, Leah can now \nexperience premenstrual syndrome. If it's bad,  \nshe wants to be alone, feels moody, and can \nhave thoughts that keep her up at night.\nIf there is no pregnancy, Leah’s uterus \nsheds her thickened lining. As a result she  \nexperiences bleeding and often painful cramps. \nThis marks the first day of menstruation.\nLeah is now exhausted. She has trouble \nconcentrating, is not motivated, and can’t  \ndo sports, which annoys her a lot. But soon after \nshe starts feeling better and the cycle continues.\nEvery young woman experiences a \ndifferent version of the menstrual cycle,  \nwith periods ranging from little to no \ndiscomfort, to heavy bleeding and intense  \npain. And about 1 in 10 girls will have to \ndeal with what’s known as endometriosis.\nEndometriosis is a condition where \ntissue grows outside the uterus.  \nThis can lead to severe and lasting \npain during their menses, intercourse,  \nor on the toilet. And eventually \nit can even lead to infertility.\nWhat do you think? How does the \nmenstrual cycle influence your life,  \nor the life of your partner or friend? And \nhow can society support women and girls who  \nexperience regular periods of pain and fatigue? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\nIf you like this video and want us to make more, \nsubscribe to our channel or support us on Patreon."
