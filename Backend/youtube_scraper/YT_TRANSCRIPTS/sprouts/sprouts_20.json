    "transcript": "The peak–end rule is a psychological \nphenomenon that occurs when people  \njudge an experience largely on how \nthey felt at its peak and its end.\nMore emotionally intense events \nlead to better memories than less  \nintense events. So if you experience a \ndrama, the peak is what’s most moving,  \nand to the mind that’s the \nmost vivid mental snapshot.\nWe have a better memory of the end of a sequence. \nIf you get to eat 3 different desserts in a row,  \nthe second dessert forms a new memory that \nmakes it harder for you to recall the first.  \nAnd when you’ve finished all three, your \nbrain remembers the last one most clearly.\nIf you happen to run a restaurant and \nmanage to meet your customers expectations,  \nyou can create a wonderful peak, finish \nwith a fantastic end and deliver an  \nexperience that’s not only excellent, \nbut will also be remembered as such."
