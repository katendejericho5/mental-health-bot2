    "video_title": "7 Principles of Psychological Persuasion",
    "transcript": "The principles of persuasion are \na set of psychological rules to  \ninfluence others. Originally there were \nsix: reciprocity, scarcity, authority,  \nconsistency, liking, and consensus. \nLater a 7th principle was added.\nThe first principle is reciprocity. It \nmeans that if you give something to someone,  \nit makes them more open to being influenced \nby you. This is because we don’t like to  \nfeel that we owe someone and so we want to \nreturn the favor to clear our social debt.\nThe second is scarcity. When people \nperceive something as rare or limited,  \nthey are more susceptible to persuasion. This is \ndriven by our desire to possess what others value,  \nand the fear of missing out that \nprompts us to make decisions.\nThe third principle is authority. We \noften trust powerful people and their  \nperceived expertise. We seek their guidance, \nparticularly in situations of uncertainty,  \nwhen we lack direction and need help from someone \nelse to make a difficult decision on our behalf.\nFourth is consistency. We are more likely \nto do something if it's consistent with  \npast behavior. This is because we align our \nactions with expectations. To influence someone,  \nask for small commitments \nfirst and larger ones later.\nThe fifth is liking. People are more willing \nto say \"yes\" to those they are fond of. To  \nmake people like you, find common interests, \nbe friendly, and give genuine compliments.\nThe sixth is consensus. Humans are inherently \nsocial. They want to conform to the group.  \nSocial proof can therefore persuade people \nto commit to something, they otherwise doubt.\nPsychologist Robert Cialdini, who came up with \nthe 6 rules, later added another one — unity.  \nAccordingly, people are more influenced by those \nwho share their beliefs, values, and experiences.\nSo do you think you understood \nthe principles? Then meet Jane,  \na young entrepreneur who, after learning about \nthem, established a successful lemonade business.  \nFollow her story and try to tell us which \nprinciples she uses and in what sequence.\nTo start her business, Jane first \nneeds to get funding. To do so,  \nshe offers free samples to potential investors. \nWhen she later presents her business idea,  \nthose who tried her product are \nnow more likely to hear her out.\nOn her first week of business, Jane produces just  \nenough to satisfy some customers but \npretends to run out before everyone  \ngets what they lined up for. By doing \nso, she creates a sense of exclusivity.\nJane then starts to showcase her top \ncustomers, encourages positive reviews,  \ninvites key opinion leaders to visit her shop, \nand hosts a local band to play on Sundays.\nOnce her products are popular, customers can’t get \nenough of them. To ensure she’s not losing anyone,  \nshe distributes paper cups to those \nin line. Those that take the cup,  \nare then more likely to \nwait for what they came for.\nDespite all that success, when Jane tries \nto open a savings account, she gets laughed  \nat. So she partners up with her supplier, to \nappear trustworthy enough to get the job done.\nTo strengthen her business, Jane listens to her \ncustomers and shows interest in the community. As  \na result, people will feel more connected to her \ncompany and stay loyal despite the competition.\nNow tell us in the comments below which of the \n7 principles Jane applied and in what order!\nNote that if these ideas aren’t \nenough to get the job done,  \nhere is one last piece of Cialdini’s advice: \n“When we ask someone to do us a favor we will  \nbe more successful if we provide a reason. \nEven if the reason is utterly unreasonable.”\nWhat do you think? Will knowing these rules \nhelp you resist manipulation, and is it morally  \nacceptable to use them for personal gain? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\nThis video was brought to you by shortform.com\nShortForm offers premium summaries of \nnonfiction books.
