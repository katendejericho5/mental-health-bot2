    "video_title": "The 10 Stages of Genocide",
    "transcript": "When living conditions worsen and the economy \nfails, people try to find reasons for their  \ntroubles. This is when political extremists \ncan become popular as they blame certain  \ngroups of people and promise that by getting \nrid of them societies’ problems will go away.\nThis can lead to the deliberate elimination of \nthose who are different because of their race,  \nreligion, sexuality, or disability \n- a phenomenon known as genocide.\nThe 10 stages of genocide are a framework for \nunderstanding how crimes against humanity happen,  \nso we can spot early warning signs \nand potentially prevent them.\nStage one is classification: \nExtremists divide people into  \nseparate groups based on their different \ncharacteristics. This often happens to  \ncreate an us-vs-them mentality or find \nsomeone to blame for social problems.\nThe second stage is symbolization: This involves \nassigning symbols or names to members of the  \nother group. The goal here is to split the \nsociety and make it clear who belongs to who.\n3rd is discrimination: The dominant \ngroup uses its power to deny others  \ncertain rights or privileges. Particular \nnew laws may limit the freedom of the  \nmarginalized ones. Instances of bullying \nincrease and the societal divide widens.\n4th is dehumanization: the targeted \ngroup is portrayed as less than human,  \noften compared to animals or diseases. \nStripping away the human qualities  \nof a person makes it easier to \njustify violence against them.\n5th is organization: This stage can \ninvolve violent mobs that are tolerated  \nby the ruling class or even the creation of \nstate-sponsored militias. In some instances,  \nperpetrators now carefully start to \nplan the next steps of the genocide.\n6th is polarization: Extremists now \ndemonize the targeted group and try  \nto fully divide society by demanding that \neveryone must take a side. Moderators who  \nwant to reduce the tensions are often \nidentified as enemies and silenced.\n7th is preparation. The criminals now plan \nfor mass murder. They may identify victims by  \nname or number, find where they live and acquire \nweapons or build facilities to aid their efforts.\n8th is persecution: Violence \nescalates. The targeted group  \nis systematically subjected \nto harassment, displacement,  \nor other forms of abuse. Often all of that \nhappens under the disguise of security measures.\n9th is extermination. The mass killing begins. The \nculprits view their victims as less than human,  \nbelieving they are \"cleansing\" the \nworld of an undesirable element,  \nand in doing so justify the use \nof disproportionate violence.\n10th is denial. Those responsible for the cruelty \ndeny their crimes, destroy evidence, blame the  \nvictims, and attempt to rewrite history justifying \ntheir actions as necessary for the greater good.\nThis is why in the aftermath of genocide, the \ncriminals must be made accountable and the  \ntrauma must be addressed. Then the survivors \nmay heal and society can attempt to reunite.\nNote that the 10 stages may not occur \nlinearly. They can happen simultaneously.\nDr. Gregory Stanton, who observed the phenomenon,  \nsuggested preventative measures to battle \neach stage, even though he believed  \nthat ultimately only an international \nintervention can stop such a disaster.\nIn Germany, Cambodia, Rwanda, and other \nplaces, help from outside often arrived  \ntoo late for too many, which is why \nStanton also founded Genocide Watch,  \na nonprofit to help prevent the \nnext tragedy from unfolding.\nWhat do you think? Is knowledge enough to prevent \ngenocidal events? And if not, what other measures  \ncan we take to avoid the next human catastrophe? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\nIf you found this helpful, check \nout our other videos and subscribe. \nIf you want to support our work, \njoin us on patreon.com/sprouts. \nFor more information and additional \ncontents, visit sproutsschools.com"
