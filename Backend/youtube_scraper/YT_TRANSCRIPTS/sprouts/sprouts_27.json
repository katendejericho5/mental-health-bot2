    "video_title": "The 5 Stages of Grief",
    "transcript": "Losing something we love, or someone who is\ndear to us, can cause us a lot of pain.\nTo accept the loss and overcome the pain,\nwe often go through five stages of grief.\nDenial, anger, bargaining, depression, and\nfinally acceptance.\nFirst comes Denial.\nWhen we experience a loss, we feel shocked\nand numb, and then simply deny what happened.\nThe refusal to accept the truth temporarily\nprotects us from all the negative thoughts\nand consequences of the tragedy.\nDenial gives us a bit of room to breathe.\nThen comes Anger.\nWe feel furious and resentful, often blaming\nourselves or others for the catastrophe.\nAnger shields us from pain.\nWe feel less vulnerable and more in control\nof the situation.\nThen there is Bargaining.\nIt is an attempt to regain control and negotiate\nthe reality of the loss.\nWe try to make promises or seek outside solutions\nto somehow reverse the irreversible.\nWhen the loss sinks in, Depression follows.\nWe go through feelings of sadness and despair.\nWe withdraw from others.\nAs we face reality, depression can help us\nprocess our grief.\nHealing can begin.\nLastly, there is acceptance.\nWe come to terms with what has happened.\nThis does not mean we forget, but we find\na way to integrate the loss into our life.\nWe may now honor the memories of those who\nhave departed and look ahead, knowing that\nafter all, life goes on.\nGetting to acceptance, however, does not mean\nit is over.\nGrief is a complex emotional response to loss,\nparticularly the loss of someone we love or\nsomething deeply meaningful — like a job.\nThis process is unique to each of us and is\nnot always linear.\nOften we cycle back, revisit stages or experience\nsome entirely new emotions.\nSometimes it can feel like we are regressing,\nbut with the support of others and each new\nday, time will help heal our wounds.\nElisabeth Kübler-Ross, a psychiatrist who\nsupported those facing their own death, observed\nthe five stages in the 1960es.\nShe later wrote:\n\"The most beautiful people we have known are\nthose who have known defeat, known suffering,\nknown struggle, known loss, and have found\ntheir way out of the depths.”\nWhat do you think? Have you ever experienced a significant loss\nin life?\nAnd if so, did you go through these 5 stages\nor did you take another path to deal with\nit?\nPlease share your thoughts and \ninsights in the comments below.\nIf you found this helpful, check \nout our other videos and subscribe. \nIf you want to support our work, \njoin us on patreon.com/sprouts. \nFor more information and additional \ncontents, visit sproutsschools.com"
