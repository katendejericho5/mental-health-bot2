    "transcript": "Emotional intelligence, also known as EI or \nEQ, is the brain's ability to see feelings  \ncoming — and then to use them, listen to what \nthey’ve got to say, and manage them effectively.\nPeople with lots of EI recognize their own \nemotions and can identify them in others. This  \nallows them to discern between different feelings, \nadjust their inner states and communicate better.\nPerhaps the most relevant model \nof “emotional intelligence” was  \ndeveloped by the psychologists John Mayer and \nPeter Salovey, who defined it in 1990 as the  \nsum of four skills: perceiving, using, \nunderstanding, and managing emotions.\nPerceiving Emotions is our ability \nto detect them in faces, pictures,  \nand voices — including in ourselves. It’s \nthe foundation of emotional intelligence  \nand makes all other processing of \nsentimental information possible.\nUsing emotions is the ability to align \nour hearts with our heads. People who  \nare emotionally intelligent can perceive \ntheir changing moods and as a result,  \nmay change what they do to channel \ntheir feelings effectively.\nUnderstanding emotions is our ability \nto comprehend the complex relationships  \nbetween feelings. It involves recognizing and \ndescribing how moods evolve and change over time.\nManaging emotions is the ability to \nregulate feelings in ourselves and  \nin others. People who are good at \nthat can control their sentiments,  \nmanage their moods, and are able to \ninfluence the emotions of others.\nWhile some people seem to be naturally gifted with \nall four abilities, others have to work hard on  \nevery single one of them. The good news is, most \nof us can improve our EI through mindfulness,  \nexercises, therapy, and education. \nAnd it seems it’s worth the effort!\nHigher emotional intelligence often \ncorrelates with higher academic and  \nprofessional success. This is \nbecause our emotions and the way  \nwe manage them impact directly on our \nbrain’s ability to listen and learn.\nAs Peter Salovey concluded: “People in good moods  \nare better at inductive reasoning \nand creative problem-solving.”\nSo what do you think? Is emotional intelligence  \nsomething we can and should try \nto teach in schools? And if so,  \nhow?
