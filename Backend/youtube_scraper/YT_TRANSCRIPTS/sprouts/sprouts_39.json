    "transcript": "Suppose there is a fence erected in the \nmiddle of nowhere that’s blocking your path:  \nwhat do you do? Do you take it \ndown in order to continue on  \nyour way? Or do you first think hard \nabout why it is there to begin with?\nChesterton's Fence is a simple rule of thumb that \nsuggests that you should never destroy a fence,  \nchange a rule, or do away with a tradition until \nyou understand why it’s there in the first place.\nLet us say, for the sake of simplicity, a \nfence or gate is erected across a road. The  \nmore modern type of reformer goes up to it and \nsays, 'I don't see the use of this; let us clear  \nit away.' To which, the more intelligent \ntype of reformer will do well to answer:\n'If you don't see the use of it, I certainly won't \nlet you clear it away. Go away and think. Then,  \nwhen you can come back and tell me that you do \nsee the use of it, I may allow you to destroy it."
