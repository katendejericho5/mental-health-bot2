    "video_title": "Darwin's Theory of Evolution: Natural Selection",
    "transcript": "In the beginning of the 19th century, \nmost people in the western world had  \na solid theory about our origins: all \ncreatures were formed by a single creator.\nBut then, in 1831, a 22-year old student \ndecided to go on an expedition that would  \nchange everything. The young man \nspent years on remote islands,  \ninvestigating living organisms and taking \ncareful notes on their differences.\nAfter close to five long years, the man \nreturned home. He organized his findings,  \nand started to write his own \ntheory on the origin of species.\nDecades later, in 1859, Charles Darwin, \nsupported by the work of Alfred Wallace,  \nchallenged the status quo with his theory \nof evolution - based on natural selection.\nNatural selection is the process through which  \npopulations of living organisms \nadapt, reproduce, and change.\nThis is possible because organisms \nevolve when random mutations happen  \nin the DNA of reproductive cells.\nStored in cells the DNA contains  \ninstructions that determine an organism's \ncharacteristics early after conception.\nFor instance, two animals with particular \nfeatures, can have a baby with very special ones.\nSince most of us are in competition \nfor limited resources, territory,  \nor potential partners, certain traits \nare beneficial, while others are not.\nAnd when the survival of one is \nchallenged by the presence of another,  \nsome can get by as they are, while \nothers must adapt or they will die out.\nOne way to adapt is to specialize for particular  \necological niches in order \nto survive and reproduce.\nOver time, it may be that there \nare certain mutations that later  \nhappen to improve one's ability for reproduction.\nIf these particular traits \nare also heritable, that is,  \npassed from parent to offspring, \nthen there will be a reproductive  \nadvantage - and that’s what modern \nevolutionary theory defines as fitness.\nThe phrase \"survival of the fittest'' stands \nfor the process within a population, where fit  \nvariants leave reproductive copies of themselves \nand less fit variants reproduce less or disappear.\nOver generations, fit traits \nbecome the dominant variation  \nin a population and can eventually \nemerge as a new species - a group of  \nsimilar organisms who interbreed \nwith each other - and no others.\nAnd as all of this happens in the surroundings \nof the organism, which may change any time,  \nit’s their natural environment that \"selects \nfor\" how successful a species is at reproduction.\nAnd this is why the entire process \nis known as natural selection.\nOne famous real life example is the story \nof peppered moths, which populated the  \nUnited Kingdom with the perfect texture \nto blend into their natural environment.\nIn the 1800s, the industrial revolution \nthen changed that. Factories and homes  \ndarkened the skies and the smoke \nfrom coal blackened everything.\nOver time the tree barks also became darker, \nand white moths were more visible to predators,  \nwhile the less prevalent \nblack moths became invisible.\nAs a result, peppered moths were more likely to  \nbe eaten and dark ones ended up \nhaving a reproductive advantage.\nBy 1970, in some regions almost \nall moths had dark wings. \nThey were not stronger, not faster, \nnot smarter, but simply fitter.\nAs humans started paying \nattention to the environment,  \nthis tendency reversed. Today mostly \nwhite moths dominate in the UK again.\nRandom genetic mutations were giving \ndark moths a reproductive advantage in  \na certain environment for \na certain period of time.\nWhat are your thoughts? Are \nall species related? And if so,  \ndo all stem from the same single \norigin? And if that's the case,  \nhow do we solve the chicken and egg problem? \nShare your thoughts in the comments below!\nIf you like how we explain complicated \nideas in simple cartoon animation,  \nyou can support us.
