    "video_title": "Cipolla’s 5 Laws of Human Stupidity",
    "transcript": "In 1976, Carlo Cipolla, a professor of \neconomic history, derived a social law,  \nby which we can group people into four \ncategories: The first he called “the helpless”,  \nthe second are “the intelligent”, the third are \n“the bandits”, and the last are “the stupid”.\nThe stupid person is the most \ndangerous type of person,  \nand in groups far more powerful than the Mafia, \nthe Military or Communism, Cipolla warned.\nTo arrive at this conclusion, we need to \nunderstand his 5 Basic Laws of Human Stupidity.\n1: Always and inevitably, everyone underestimates \nthe number of stupid individuals in circulation.\n2: The probability that a person is stupid \nis independent of any other characteristic  \nof that person. Education, wealth or \nstatus have nothing to do with it.\n3: A stupid person is someone who causes losses \nto other people while himself deriving no gain.\n4: Non-stupid people always underestimate \nthe damaging power of stupid people and keep  \nforgetting that to deal with stupid people \nalways turns out to be a costly mistake.\n5: A stupid person is the most dangerous type \nof person, even more dangerous than a bandit.\nCipolla then considers four factors of human \nbehavior. A person can cause benefits to others,  \nbenefits to themselves, losses to \nothers and losses to themselves.\nIf Tom takes an action and suffers a loss, \nhe’s helpless. If Tom benefits himself,  \nwhile also benefiting Jerry, he’s \nintelligent. If Tom helps himself,  \nbut causes Jerry a loss, he's a bandit. And if \nTom does something that’s of no benefit to him,  \nbut causes Jerry a loss he’s stupid. \nIneffectual people are in the center.\nLet's now look at the effects \nof these groups on society.\nHelpless people contribute to society \nbut are taken advantage of by others,  \nespecially bandits. And so \ntheir contribution is limited.\nNote that extreme altruists \nor pacifists may willingly  \naccept a place in this category for moral reasons.\nIntelligent people contribute \nto society and leverage their  \ncontributions into reciprocal benefits.\nTheir actions lead to a net gain to society,  \nwhich is why helpless people should \nalways support intelligent ones.\nBandits pursue their own self-interest \nand enrich themselves, even when doing  \nso poses a harm to society. Helpless and \nintelligent people should try to stop them.\nStupid people always contribute to a net loss  \nto society. But not only that. As \nthey do so for no obvious reason,\nTheir actions also frustrate, \nanger and confuse everyone else.\nAgainst major cultural trends among his fellow \nintellectuals, Cipolla was convinced that men  \nare not equal. That some are stupid and others \nare not, and that the difference is determined  \nby nature and nothing else. One is stupid \nin the same way one is red-haired, he wrote.\nCipolla warned that the damaging potential \nof the stupid person therefore depends on  \nthe amount of stupidity inherited, as well \nas their position of power in a society.\nAmong bureaucrats, generals and politicians one  \nhas little difficulty in finding clear \nexamples of basically stupid individuals,  \nwhose damaging capacity was alarmingly enhanced \nby the position of the power they occupied.\nWhat are your thoughts on stupidity? Are \npeople born or made stupid? Or is it,  \nas usual, more complex, and is there \nan interrelationship between the two? \nShare your thoughts, and read more \nabout Cipolla's work and amusing  \nessay — which originally was only intended \nfor friends — in the descriptions below.\nIf you found this helpful, check \nout our other videos and subscribe. \nIf you want to support our work, \njoin us on patreon.com/sprouts. \nFor more information and additional \ncontents, visit sproutsschools.com"
