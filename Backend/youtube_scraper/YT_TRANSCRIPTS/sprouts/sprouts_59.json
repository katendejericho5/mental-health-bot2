    "video_title": "The Effects of Weed on Teenage Brains",
    "transcript": "When a person is smoking cannabis, one \nof the plant’s chemicals known as THC,  \npasses from the lungs into the bloodstream. The \nTHC is then carried by the blood to the brain,  \nwhere it acts on specific cannabinoid receptors.\nThese receptors are found in areas of \nthe brain associated with: concentration, \nthinking,\ntime perception, \ncoordination,\nmemory, \nand sensory pleasures.\nThe effects of THC activation in these areas \nis responsible for the “high” that people  \nfeel. But besides creating an altered \nstate of mind, something else happens.\nIn the United States, according to a 2018 survey, \n1 in 8 adolescents aged 12 to 17, consumed  \nmarijuana in the past year. In 12th grade, about \n1 in 16 do so daily. So - what’s the problem?  \nEven super smart people smoke, right? Let’s look \nat the effect of cannabis on a teenager's brain!\nThe brain's response to counter the \neffects of THC impairs it’s attention, \nits ability to remember, and \nits potential for learning.\nThese Effects can last up to \nseveral days. This would not be  \nsuch a problem if our brain ran like \na machine. But that’s not the case.\nThe brain is a living organism — maybe the \nmost precious one there is. In teeangers,  \nthat organism is still immature. It \ntakes about 25 years for the human  \nbrain to be fully developed. This is \nwhy when teenagers and adults argue,  \nthey often come to different conclusions. \nThere is a biological reason for that.\nAdults have a fully developed prefrontal cortex,  \nthe part of the brain that is responsible \nfor judgment and an awareness of long-term  \nconsequences. The cortex of teenagers is \nstill growing. They are more influenced  \nby their already matured limbic system, \nwhich responds to fears and emotions.\nIf the developing brain is \nexposed to a lot of THC,  \nthe part responsible for controlling emotions \nmay never reach its full potential. This can  \nhave long-term consequences and effects on one's \nmeasurable intelligence, learning and judgment.\nOne study that followed 13 year olds \nfor 25 years has found that those who  \nregularly consume marijuana lose on \naverage 5.8 IQ points by the time  \nthey reach adulthood. Since our average \nIQ is just 100, that is enough to shut  \nthe door to a good college or close the \nopportunity to work at a great company.\nBut that’s not all.\nThere is also evidence that some \nteenagers that use cannabis are  \nat higher risk of developing depression \nor even a psychosis. A psychosis changes  \nthe way the brain processes information, \nand causes you to lose touch with reality.  \nYou can see and hear things that aren't \nreal and may completely lose your mind.\nIn short, the high of cannabis comes with a \nmultitude of side-effects. Some might be fun,  \nsome might be healing, and some are \npotentially horrible — we don’t always know.\nIf you want to live life with the ultimate \nlearning machine inside your head,  \nyou might want to wait until your mind \nis fully developed before trying weed.\nWhat are your thoughts? Did you ever try \ncannabis as a teenager? And if so, do you  \nthink it did damage to your mind or not?
