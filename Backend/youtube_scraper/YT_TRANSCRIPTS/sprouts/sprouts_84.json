    "video_title": "Nietzsche: God Is Dead",
    "transcript": "god is dead god remains dead and we have \nkilled him friedrich nietzsche wrote in 1882  \nto understand what the german philosopher meant \nand what he thought of men morality and society  \nas a whole we collaborated with professor \nstephen hicks on this sprout special series\npart one god is dead for thousands \nof years humans have been religious  \nbut in the modern world religion has \nbecome a shadow of its former self  \nnietzsche's dramatic phrase god is dead is meant \nto capture the shocking quality of this revelation\nfor those raised religiously \nreligion personalized the world  \nit gave them a sense that the world had a \npurpose and that they were part of a larger plan  \nit gave them the comfort that despite appearances \nwe are all equal and cared for and that upon death  \ninstead of a cold grave a possible \nhappily ever after ending awaits\nbut in the modern world we find it increasingly \nhard to believe those values we have seen the  \ndramatic rise of science which has offered \nless comfortable answers to questions religion  \ntraditionally had a monopoly on we have thrown off \nthe shackles of feudalism with its unquestioning  \nacceptance of authority and have become more \nindividualistic and naturalistic in our thinking  \nbut in historical time all of this has happened \nvery quickly for millennia we have been religious  \nbut come the 19th century even the average \nman had heard that religion may have reached  \nthe end of its journey for most of us even \nthe suggestion of this hints at a crisis\nimagine a 13 year old who is awakened in the \nmiddle of the night to be told by strangers  \nthat both his parents have died he is suddenly an \norphan for as long as he can remember his mother  \nand father were present in his life looking after \nhim and guiding him now they are gone and ready or  \nnot he is thrust into that world alone how does \nthe young teen handle that sudden transition\nculturally nietzsche says we are like that young \nteen for as long as we can remember our society  \nhas relied upon god the father to look \nafter us but now suddenly we are orphaned  \nwe wake up one morning to discover that in \nour heart of hearts our naively childhood  \nreligious beliefs have withered so now \nwhether we like it or not a question  \ncreeps into our minds how do we face the \nprospect of a world without god and religion\nin the 19th century says nietzsche most \npeople did not face that question well  \nmost people avoid the issue sensing that even to \nraise it would be to enter dangerous territory  \nlife without religion is too scary to contemplate \nso they retreat to a safety zone of belief  \nand repeat nervously the formulas \nthey have learned about faith\nslightly better to nietzsche but not much \nare the socialists of the 19th century  \nsocialism is on the rise and many socialists \naccept that god is dead but then they are very  \nconcerned that the state take god's place and look \nafter them the mighty state will provide for us  \nand tell us what to do against the mean people of \nthe world think of it this way the judeo-christian  \ntradition says this is a world of sin in \nwhich the weak suffer at the hands of the  \nstrong that we should all be selfless and serve \ngod and others especially the sick and helpless  \nand that in a future ideal world heaven \nthe lion will lie down with lamb and the  \ninescapable power of god will bring salvation \nto the meek and judgment to the wicked  \nthe socialist tradition says this is a world \nof evil exploitation in which the strong take  \nadvantage of the weak but we should all be \nselfless and sacrifice for the good of others  \nespecially the needy from each according to \nhis ability to each according to his need  \nand the forces of history will necessarily \nbring about a future ideal world that will  \nend all harsh competition empowering the \noppressed and eliminating the evil exploiters\nboth religion and socialism thus glorify weakness \nand need both recoil from the world as it is  \ntough unequal harsh both flee to an \nimaginary future realm where they can feel  \nsafe both say be a nice boy be a good little \ngirl share feel sorry for the little people  \nand both desperately seek someone to look \nafter them whether it be god or the state  \nso where asks nature are the men of courage \nwho is willing to stare into the abyss who  \ncan stand alone on the icy mountain top who \ncan look at tiger in the eye without flinching\nto be continued\nnietzsche who was born in 1844\nwas not only a fierce critic of  \nchurch and socialism but also nationalism \nand anti-semitism his strong moral stance  \nmeant that he openly condemned \nmany of his intellectual friends  \nand even broke his relationship with his own \nsister who married a notorious anti-semite\nso what are your thoughts on nietzsche do
