    "transcript": "I'm sure you've gotten unsolicited\nadvice maybe you start to share\nsomething with someone and they start\ntelling you how you have to change your\ndiet try yoga start meditating and\ninside you start to feel really annoyed\nand maybe even shut down so today I'm\ngoing to explain why people give\nunsolicited advice and what you can do\nabout it there's of course different\nreasons why people give unsolicited\nadvice one of them is that they mean\nwell and they care they're compassionate\nthey see that you're struggling with\nsomething and they want to help your\nproblem fix your issue or help relieve\nyour suffering another reason is that\nthey actually think that they're showing\nempathy this is usually the case if\nthey've gone through something similar\nand they end up sharing with you what\nworked for them they think they're being\na good helpful person another reason is\nthat they feel uncomfortable when you\nstart sharing what you're struggling or\nthe issue that you're having they start\nfeeling uncomfortable inside so they\nthink if I can give a piece of advice or\nsolve the problem quickly both of us can\nfeel better another reason is that they\nmight regularly play a caretaking role\nmeaning they're simply conditioned to\nalways try to help other people or\nalways try to save them even if it's\ncoming from a well-meaning place getting\nunsolicited advice never really feels\ngood when we're sharing something we\nusually just want to be seen and feel\nheard and when we're given advice we\nusually end up then feeling really\ninvalidated so now I'm going to share\nsome scripts with you that you can use\nthe next time time you get unsolicited\nadvice this first one is really helpful\nto use before you share something with\nsomeone especially if they usually give\nyou unsolicited advice what you can say\nis I'd love to share something with you\nand I'm not looking for any advice right\nnow I just need to vent do you have any\ntime to listen this will give the person\nthat you're speaking to an immediate\nunderstanding or an expectation of\nexactly what you're looking for and it\ncan help them end up feeling more\nrelaxed when you're sharing now here are\nsome scripts that you can share with\nsomeone after they've given you\nunsolicited advice one thing you can say\nis I appreciate how much you care about\nme and I know how I'm going to deal with\nthis so I don't really need your advice\nright now this is really helpful to use\nwith someone that you're close to it\nillustrates to them that you know that\ntheir advice is coming from a\nwell-meaning place and that you also\nhave a plan of your own another script\nyou can say is I'm okay and have support\nin dealing with this I just need to let\nyou know what was going on with me right\nnow this is really helpful when you're\ndealing with something that might be\nongoing and you're speaking to someone\nthat you're not really close to maybe\nyou just want to let them know that you\nhave something going on and maybe you're\ngoing to be a little different or\ndistant third script that you can use is\nby simply saying I'm really glad that\nworked for you I'll keep that in mind\nit's short it's simple it's really\nhelpful to use with someone who often\ngives you advice because it doesn't\nreally discount their perspective and it\nsometimes can even end the conversation\nstop them from giving you another piece\nof advice I know many of you listening\nespecially if you're a people pleaser\nmight be thinking that some of these\nsound rude I want to remind you that\nit's actually a very kind thing to do to\ndirectly let people know what you need\nespecially if someone that is giving you\nunsolicited advice is someone that\nyou're close to it is worth investing\nthe time and energy to directly let that\nperson know the exact type of support\nthat you're looking for you'll end up\nfeeling much less resentful and probably\nbe more open to sharing by using these\nscripts you can really take these\nmoments of possible disconnection and\nturn them into moments of shared\nunderstanding into a growing connection\nI'd love to hear from you in the\ncomments how do you deal with\nunsolicited advice"
