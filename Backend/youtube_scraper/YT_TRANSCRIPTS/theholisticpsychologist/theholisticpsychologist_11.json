    "transcript": "if you grew up in a home where your\nparents yelled a lot and fought a lot\nand you never knew if things were good\nor bad you ended up looking outside of\nyourself a lot of the time you probably\nbecame hyper aware of changes in\npeople's behaviors in their moods in\ntheir tones of voice because as a kid\nyou had the job of making sure that\neveryone around you felt better or was\nokay and now as an adult you probably\nare still focused on other people to\nkeep yourself safe this is why so many\nof us struggle with social events and\nhave social anxiety when we're in a\ngroup of people\nall of our energy is spent attuning to\nor worrying about what other people are\nthinking or what they're perceiving\nabout us instead of attuning to our own\ninternal world and actually connecting\nwith other people this is why so many of\nus feel exhausted when we get home after\ninteracting socially almost feeling like\nwe need time to recover or why some of\nus only feel at ease or able to relax\nwhen we're alone and no one's around us\nto judge us"
