    "transcript": "The Golden Child is the one in the\nfamily that's viewed as the perfect\nchild without faults constantly\ncelebrated in dysfunctional families\nparents often unconsciously choose one\nchild to give the whole family a sense\nof Pride there's a couple of reasons a\ngolden child might be chosen the first\nis that the parent needs validation from\nthe outside world and they can get it\nthrough that child another reason is the\nparent feels insecure or inadequate\nthemselves and they can feel worth y\nthrough that child's accomplishments and\nanother reason they might be chosen is\nbecause the entire family structure is\ndysfunctional and so this golden child\nbecomes the proof that the family is\ndoing well or that they're succeeding so\nhere are five signs that you were The\nGolden Child one you have an excessive\nneed to achieve you weren't loved for\nbeing who you are but for what you did\nso you keep trying to achieve things\nthroughout life in order to get that\nlove that you so deeply desire two you\ndon't even know who you are from a young\nage you were pushed and molded to do the\nthings that your parents felt were\nvaluable or rewarding you didn't get to\nexplore your own Ambitions your own\ninterest so you might wake up one day\nand wonder who you really are or you\ncould feel like you've gone on a path\nthat was chosen for you but you don't\nfeel any Pride or any sense of\nfulfillment a really common example of\nthis is a lot of us who choose a career\nlike a doctor or a lawyer solely for our\nparent or family's approval three you\nmight be perfectionistic you can be\nperfectionistic because you're insecure\nabout who you actually are and when\nyou're taught that the only way you're\nworthy of Love or approval is by being\ngood enough or by performing you start\nto feel shame all of the moments where\nyou don't feel perfect and in reality\nmaking mistakes is very human it's a\npart of life but you were never given\nthe room to make mistakes or to explore\nso you created an internal drive in\nyourself to always have to be perfect\nfour you are parentified from a young\nage you became a parent to your own\nparent you might have felt like you had\nto be their therapist or their\ncheerleader and had to spend a lot of\ntime trying to emotionally support your\nparents or having to be the strong one\nfor the whole family in healthy families\nparents meet their children's emotional\nneeds not the other way around five\nthere's a lot of sibling rivalry you\nmight have had a lot of conflict with\nyour siblings usually because there's\ncompetition for a parents affection or a\nparent who complains about the other\nsiblings though these Dynamics are never\nspoken about in the family family\neveryone can feel them it causes a lot\nof stress and usually a lot of conflict\nbetween family members so what is the\nadult impact of being a golden child you\ncan find yourself having high anxiety it\ncould be social anxiety or just overall\nracing thoughts and constant worries\nabout the future because you didn't get\nthe chance to feel safe and secure your\nbody is always on high alert in\nrelationships you need to feel safe and\nsecure enough just to be yourself and to\nbe accepted without fearing someone\nelse's response reaction or opinion\nanother impact can be on relationship\ninsecurity you grow up without a secure\npresence in your life and because your\nparents figures they weren't supportive\nthey weren't understanding you might\ncontinue to struggle in adult\nrelationships having abandonment issues\nor feeling overwhelmed and smothered\nwhen you're in them you're consciously\nor subconsciously afraid to let anyone\nsee your imperfections or flaws flaws\nthat we all have and this triggers a lot\nof Shame if and when they do\nanother adult impact is on our low sense\nof self-worth you didn't get the chance\nto develop a sense of self or to know\nand be confident about who you are\ninstead you became an image of what your\nparent wanted or what they believed you\nto be and this can manifest by us\ngetting into dysfunctional relationships\nnot having clear boundaries not speaking\nup for what we need in work settings in\nany setting and a deep root of belief\nthat you're just not worthy to be who\nyou are another impact is having a lack\nof boundaries boundaries were completely\nnon-existent or you might have had your\nboundaries violated on a regular basis\nso you find yourself always thinking or\nworrying about what will make a parent\nor someone else happy or even fearing\ntheir reaction really common examples of\nhaving no boundaries is when parents\novershare marital issues telling you\nabout the problems that they're having\nwithin each other's relationship they\nmight read your diary or maybe expect\nyou to be their best friend sharing all\nof their problems and expecting you to\nsolve them for them as an adult you\nprobably end up being a people pleaser\nyou hate saying no and you take on\nthings even when you don't have the\nspace for it really feeling guilty if\nand when you ever let anyone else down\nif you're listening and if you're\nthinking this is me don't worry there is\nalways hope if you were The Golden Child\nthe first thing you want to do is start\nto spend time with yourself begin to get\nto know yourself explore who you really\nare getting Beyond what's always been\nexpected of you and learning what's\ninside of you you'll also want to learn\nhow to set healthy boundaries which\nmight mean setting some with your\nparents as an adult while you might\nstill notice these same patterns\nhappening today today you're no longer a\nchild and you can assert yourself\nletting others know when you need space\nor when you feel uncomfortable remember\nit is not your responsibility to perform\nor to be perfect and it's also not your\nresponsibility to fit into the roles\nanyone else has chosen for you your\nresponsibility is to be who you\nauthentically are I know\nso many of us grew up this way I know I\ndid so in the comments let's talk about\nit I want to hear about your experiences\nas The Golden Child"
