    "transcript": "childhood emotional neglect is really\ncommon I've experienced it I saw it in a\nlot of my clients individually I see it\nnow really regularly in my community and\nit's actually something that as a\nsociety we don't talk much about so\ntoday I'm going to talk about how\nchildhood emotional neglect shows up in\nour lives as adults but first what is\nchildhood emotional neglect as children\nwe have emotional needs some of us\ndidn't have present caregivers at all\nothers had physically present caregivers\nwho were able to care for us physically\nbut they were not able to attune to us\nemotionally to sense when we were\nstressed or upset and help soothe those\noverwhelming emotions to develop a\nhealthy sense of self we need a parent\nfigure to mirror back our emotions to\ncomfort or to soothe us and to\nultimately help us learn how to self\nsooth this takes a regulated patient\nsupportive parent who understands their\nown emotions so that they can then help\nus understand ours so here are some\nexamples of childhood emotional neglect\nyou were never asked how you were or\nwhat you thought you were shown little\ninterest in your inner World another\nexample you were regularly dismissed\nmaybe you were told it's not a big deal\nor toughen up or maybe you were told to\nstop feeling what you were feeling\nentirely another example you weren't\nshown much affection you weren't given\nverbal reassurances you weren't told I\nlove you you weren't told you were doing\na good job a final example you were left\nalone to deal with stressful or\nupsetting experiences maybe after your\nparents fought you were just left alone\nin your room and no one talked about it\nit just went on as if everything was\nnormal leaving you alone with all of\nthat stress and that upset when we\nexperience childhood emotional neglect\nwe start to believe that there is\nsomething broken or that there is\nsomething wrong with us and it creates\ndysfunctional patterns especially in our\nrelationships so how does childhood\nemotional neglect affect you as an adult\none you have a difficulty understanding\nwhat you feel and how to talk about it\nbecause I experience childhood emotional\nneglect I don't always know what I'm\nfeeling and if I do know what I'm\nfeeling I feel really uncomfortable\nexpressing my emotions you might also\nfind yourself uncomfortable when anyone\nelse expresses a big emotion because you\nweren't taught how to cope with emotions\nor how to be with someone when they're\nexperiencing emotions\ntwo you're often highly reactive when\nyou don't know how to cope with your\nemotions you can become emotionally\nreactive really easily you might become\nreally defensive when someone shares\nwith you how they feel or what they\nexperienced because you feel like you're\nbeing personally attacked you might end\nup invalidating what they're sharing\ntelling them it didn't happen or maybe\ndeflecting it talking about the last\ntime they did the same thing to you this\nis likely how you witnessed or\nexperienced your parents dealing with\ntheir emotions and so you Contin\ncontinue that same pattern three you\nstruggle being transparent you really\nstruggle letting people in and sharing\nyour inner world so you might end up\ntelling White Lies leaving certain\nthings out or feel like you need to hide\nthings in general this makes sense\nbecause you were often invalidated as a\nchild when you shared how you fell or\nwere told that things weren't a big deal\nso hiding things or keeping things\nextremely private actually helps you\nfeel safe but on the other hand it can\nalso cause issues in your relationships\nbecause letting people in and being\ntransparent is the foundation of healthy\nsupportive relationships four you're a\npeople pleaser because you didn't get\nthe love and the support that you needed\ngrowing up you often go into a pleasing\nrole believing that showing up for\nothers or keeping them happy is the only\nway to be loved this shows up in work in\nfriendships in romantic relationships\nwhere you continue to betray yourself\noften feeling like you're giving a ton\nand you're not receiving much back and\nas a result you usually end up feeling\nreally resentful five you're attracted\nto unavailable partners are you in\nrelationships with people who are\navailable who support you emotionally\nand you can depend on or are you with\npeople who downplay your experiences and\nleave you feeling like you're getting\nemotional breadcrumbs who you seek as\nromantic Partners comes from what you\nexperienced growing up you will\nsubconsciously be drawn to people who\nare emotionally unavailable because\nthat's what you've experienced and\nthat's where you'll feel the most\ncomfortable if these things feel like\nyou no you're not alone a lot of us\ndidn't get our emotional needs met as\nchildren and as an adult we can work on\nbreaking these patterns on learning to\nunderstand how we feel and starting to\ncreate healthy relationships for\nyourself and for others if you resonate\nI'd love to hear your experiences in the\ncomments"
