    "transcript": "my partner shuts down all the time I try\nto get him to talk to me and he won't\nthen he'll just say he needs space and I\nget even more clingy it sounds like your\npartner is avoidant and the more I try\nto connect with him the more distant he\ngets it's helpful to understand that\navoidant attachment comes from a\nchildhood where a person usually spent a\nlot of time alone and didn't get much\nemotional connection from a parent after\ngetting let down over and over again\nthey learned to cope by not needing\nanyone most people who are avoidant are\nhyper independent and take a lot of\npride in doing things themselves\nyeah and it leaves me feeling really\nrejected and alone because for you\nsafety is closeness and for him safety\nis distance when you try to get close\nhis impulse is to move further away and\nas he moves farther away your impulse is\nto get even closer this is the anxious\nand avoidant dance that so many couples\nfind themselves in"
