    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about the glass\nchild the glass child was the child that\nwas alone they pretty much raised\nthemselves you were there but no one\nactually got to know you or support you\nin any way people pretty much saw\nthrough you like glass here are five\nsigns that you grew up as the glass\nchild one you were highly sensitive and\naware of the family stress you just felt\nit two you were drawn to people pleasing\nworrying about everyone else and showing\nup in the way they need it was an\nadaptation that kept you connected in\nyour relationships three you had a\nsibling or siblings that were difficult\nor demanded the focus of your parents\nleaving you with little to none four you\nwere the Peacekeeper between your\nparents whether it was during arguments\nor generally always trying to keep\nthings as calm as possible five you\nheard you were mature for your age or\nmaybe you were an old soul whether it\nwas by family members or people outside\nof the family\nyou've learned that everything falls on\nyou you can't ask for help and you\ndevelop this I can do it all mentality\nyou grow up feeling unsupported and\nalone feeling you don't belong you\ndevelop a belief that there must be\nsomething wrong with you that you have\nto be perfect or without flaws in order\nto be loved and accepted the glass child\nis always trying to prove themselves\nalways trying to seek approval from\nothers they have this core belief that\nin order to be seen they have to perform\nor achieve and this comes from not being\nseen for being who you authentically are\nyou might think I'm invisible unless I\ndo something for someone else or no one\nsees me unless I'm perfect or maybe they\nmight think I'm not worth noticing at\nall adults who are the glass child might\ncontinue to struggle in relationships\nsome might find themselves emotionally\nunavailable at times others overly\nclingy struggling to tolerate any space\nor distance they might feel uncomfort\nCom fortable or disconnected around\ntheir family members because their\nrelationships are very surface they\nmight end up feeling like familiar\nstrangers they might fear asking for\nhelp or being vulnerable avoiding\nshowing any emotion at all or they might\nbe hyper indpendent remember there are\nstrengths to growing up this way you've\nlearned to be resilient you've learned\nto be resourceful you've learned to rely\non yourself but how can you heal if\nyou're a glass child first you can let\nyour child grieve you had to grow up way\ntoo soon you had to figure things out\nand you didn't get any of your emotional\nneeds met so it's important to allow\nyourself to acknowledge any and all of\nthe feelings or emotions you might have\nwhether it's sadness loss anger shame\nand to acknowledge what actually\nhappened next you can begin to set\nboundaries you weren't allowed to set\nany boundaries in childhood and you\noften had to put your parents or your\nsiblings needs before your own so so now\nit's important to begin to care for\nyourself by setting new limits with\nothers which will help you rebuild a\nhealthy adult\nidentity next you can learn how to ask\nfor help asking for help or support will\nfeel really awkward and uncomfortable at\nfirst but being vulnerable and allowing\nyourself to actually be supported is how\nyou create healthy relationships\ndirectly asking for help and telling\nclose friends or Partners what you need\ncreates deeper relationships for example\nyou can say\nI need you to help me with the house\nTores this week or I would feel most\nsupported if you just listen to what I\nhave to share next you can build your\nself identity because you may struggle\nwith knowing who you actually are and\nwhat you actually want it's completely\nnormal to need time to explore and to\ndiscover yourself you can begin by\ntaking yourself on dates exploring the\nthings that you used to enjoy or\ndiscovering new interest even small\nsteps in getting connected with who you\nare is so important learning and\nexpressing who you actually are will\nhelp you attract healthier relationships\nwith people who actually want to know\nyou for who you are if you grew up as a\nglass child I'd love to hear about your\nexperience leave it in the comments"
