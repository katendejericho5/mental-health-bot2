    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about the Dark\nNight of the Soul The Dark Night of the\nsoul is a period of time where our soul\nis essentially screaming out we've been\nso disconnected from our authentic self\nour wants our needs and our\nself-expression that we begin to feel\ndetached from the world around us and\nsome of us even feel numb so essentially\nit's when we wake up and we begin to\nquestion everything we question\nourselves we question our relationships\nwe question the entire world around us\nwe feel this calling to to go inward\nreally simply to begin to reconnect to\nget curious about who we really are and\nwhat it is that we really want I went\nthrough a Dark Night of the soul and it\nhappened at a time when I had come to\nthe end of my list of lifelong\nachievements I had a successful practice\nI was in a committed relationship I was\nliving nearby to my family yet I felt so\nempty so unfulfilled not like I imagined\nI would feel once I accomplished all of\nthese things I started to have these\nreally scary physical symptoms out of\nnowhere I began to faint of course that\nmade me concerned that something was\nwrong with me I became highly\nemotionally reactive I was agitated all\nof the time I would go through periods\nwhere I would feel such high anxiety and\nthen go through other periods where I\nwould feel nothing I would feel\ncompletely numb as I looked around at\nthis entire life I created and I wasn't\nfeeling that sense of connection ction\nto it I began to feel really hopeless\nwhy was it that I was showing up each\nand every day and actually started to\nentertain some thoughts about running\naway I would imagine escaping this life\nand just going somewhere else to start\nagain what I didn't know was that all of\nthis was happening and I was feeling\nthis way because I was so disconnected\nfrom myself I didn't know what I\nactually wanted or what I needed and I\nwasn't meeting my needs the lifestyle I\nwas living I was keeping myself\nendlessly distracted with either plans\nor achievements I was drinking too much\nI was eating too many inflammatory foods\nand I simply wasn't taking care of my\nbody I wasn't taking care of my body\nbecause I wasn't connected to my body\nand because I wasn't connected to my\nbody I wasn't connected to my emotions\nif I was even aware of what I was\nfeeling I wasn't able to share it with\nthose around me I was always worried\nabout upsetting someone or disappointing\nsomeone living in the state of\ndisconnection didn't allow me to connect\nwith what I truly wanted my purpose my\npassion and was doing work that I didn't\nfeel connected to feeling so unfulfilled\nso hopeless and so overwhelmed I found\nmyself wanting to not be around other\npeople and for me this was a huge change\nI always wanted to have plans I always\nwanted to be around other people I\nalways wanted to be doing something and\nnow I was finding myself wanting to go\ninto this cocoon to be alone and when I\nwas alone I was only more present to all\nof the upsetting and overwhelming\nfeelings inside of me I began to worry\nthat there was something wrong with me\nright how could I have so much and how\ncould I feel so bad and this is why I'm\nmaking this video this stage The Dark\nKnight of the soul is a natural part of\nour healing Journey it's giving us\nindication it's a sign that we might\nneed to step away we might not need to\nstop doing all of this conditioned\nthings that we've learned we have to or\nwe should do and we might need time for\nourselves now of course I imagine many\nof you are thinking I have all these\nobligations there are things I have to\ndo I have to pay the rent I have to take\ncare of my children I had to do the same\nso in the moments where we don't have to\ndo something on the weekends a couple\nhours before work a couple hours after\nwork after the children go to bed those\nare the moments that we can begin to\ntake for ourselves carving out time\ncarving out space beginning to explore\nand learn who it is that we really are\nso if you're out there having all of\nthese experiences all of these feelings\nbecome coming overwhelmed maybe not even\nknowing who it is that you are and what\nit is that you want I want you to know\nthat there's nothing wrong with you\nthese feelings are often a sign that\nyou're growing that you're involving\nthat the world and the life you created\nmaybe doesn't fit for you as much\nanymore so what do you do the three\nsteps the first step is acceptance\naccept how you're feeling don't try to\nminimize it don't try to deny it don't\ntry to invalidate it and begin to create\nspace in your life to get curious and\nexplore what you might actually want\nwhat you might actually need and as you\nget those pings stop resisting or\ndenying it watch in your mind for all of\nthose shoulds well I shouldn't rest\nright now I shouldn't stop I should be\ndoing this or that and take a moment to\naccept that you might not want to\nanymore and that's okay these choices to\naccept what we really want and what we\nreally feel will allow us to take that\nnext step which is to surrender many\nmany of us are going to be creating a\nnew reality we're going to be changing\nthe way we're living making new\nlifestyle choices we're going to be\nshowing up differently in our\nrelationships so our relationship\nDynamics will change some of us may even\nbegin to separate from some\nrelationships so allowing this new\nreality to be what it is means grieving\nfor many of us a way of living in\nidentity maybe even grieving the actual\nending of some of our relationships\nas we're taking these first Two Steps\nstep three is so incredibly important\nit's foundational step three is\nself-care making sure that we're feeding\nour bodies the nutrients that it needs\nmaking sure that we're taking moments to\nrest that we're getting restorative\nsleep at night and that we're moving our\nbody releasing for many of us all of\nthis old stored energy a lot of emotions\nare going to come up when we're in the\ndark KN of the Soul many of us are going\nto become present to emotions that have\nbeen below the surface for so long\nyou're going to feel tired you're going\nto need your physical resources to be\nable to tend to your emotions that are\ncoming up now of course everyone is\ngoing to go through the Dark Knight\ndifferently it's going to feel\ndifferently for each of you listening\nyou might even go through it multiple\ntimes as you shed more and more of your\nidentity returning more and more to your\nauthentic self as a reminder all of this\nmeans that you're healing that you're\nevolving our Human Experience is one of\nevolution\nif you've gone through this or if you're\ngoing through this right now I'd love to\nhear from you in the comments"
