    "transcript": "having emotionally immature parents can\nbe really frustrating my last episode\nwas on signs of emotionally immature\nparents so you might want to watch that\none first now before I get into the\nsteps I want you to know you can't\nchange your parent really that's the\nhardest part of all of this but I'm\ngoing to teach you things you can do to\nprotect your energy to help yourself\nheal and to build your own life and\nremember that this is a process so let's\nget into the steps to dealing with an\nemotionally immature parent step one\npicture them as a small child when\nthey're having a tantrum or getting\nreally defensive you want to actually\npicture them as a six-year-old child\nthis will help you stay calm in your\nbody and remind you that even though\nyour parent might be 50 60 or 70 years\nold their developmental age is different\nfrom their actual age a lot of people\nbenefit from this because it helps them\nzoom out and to see their behavior for\nwhat it is step two manage your\nexpectations this is one of the most\nimportant steps emotionally immature\nparents can't give their children what\nthey need this means that we have to\naccept that they just can't support us\nin some ways and by knowing this you'll\nslowly put less and less pressure on\nyour parent to be someone that they\ncan't be and start to release some of\nyour own resentment so I'll give you an\nexample of this let's say you know your\nemotionally immature parent really\nstruggles to acknowledge your\naccomplishments and is pretty critical\nyou go to work get a promotion and\nyou're feeling really excited you want\nto call your mom to tell her about it\nand you really want her to share in that\nexcitement but you realize that your mom\nprobably isn't going to shareing that\nexcitement she might even say something\nnegative about your workload or your new\nboss so you take a minute to consciously\nchoose if you actually want to call and\ntell her the more realistic you become\nthe less crushed you'll be when your\nparent behaves in the typical way that\nthey do step three set clear boundaries\nthe most important thing you can have\nwith an emotionally immature parent is\nclear boundaries emotionally immature\nparents tend to be detached critical or\ndemanding because they don't know\nhealthier ways to express themselves so\nit's important that you don't engage and\ndon't play into their Cycles I'll give\nyou an example of this if it's taken you\na while to return their calls and when\nyou do call them back they say something\nlike oh wow haven't heard from you in a\nwhile you can just respond with I know\nI've been busy you want to remain calm\nand\nnon-reactive one thing about most\nemotionally immature people is they\nreally crave that drama and Chaos in\ntheir connections so setting boundaries\nallows you to remove yourself from that\nI also want to note some emotionally\nimmature parents are abusive and that\nsome people do need to go no contact\nit's really painful but some people just\ncan't have a relationship for their own\nemotional health so I do want to\nacknowledge that reality okay step four\nlet yourself breathe growing up with an\nemotionally immature parent is really\npainful there's a grieving period where\nyou face the reality that your parents\ncouldn't give you what you truly needed\nallow yourself to feel whatever comes up\nand know you are not alone let your\ninner child feel their pain and\nacknowledge it as you grieve you can\nslowly process it and begin to heal and\nthe best way to do this is to write your\ninner child a letter letting them know\nthat you recognize all that they've been\nthrough and that you're going to be\nthere for them now and remember no one\nelse is going to see this letter so\nreally allow yourself to write whatever\ncomes up I really hope this episode gave\nyou a helpful start to the process of\nlearning new ways to respond to your\nparent and to having even more\ncompassion for yourself I want to hear\nfrom you in the comments how has your\nemotionally immature parent impacted\nyour life"
