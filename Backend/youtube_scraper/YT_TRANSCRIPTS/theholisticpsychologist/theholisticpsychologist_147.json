    "transcript": "in this video I'm going to share my\nexact method for healing from\ndissociation you can practice this every\nday anywhere you are if you want to\nlearn more about dissociation what it is\nin the five signs watch my last video so\nlet's get into it this method is called\nconscious check-in when we're\ndissociated we're unconscious we're\ncompletely in autopilot those of you who\ndissociate regularly will really\nunderstand what I'm saying here you\nmight lose track of time or drive\nsomewhere or put something away and not\neven remember doing it you know you did\nit but it's almost like it wasn't you\ndoing it what we need to do to break the\npattern of dissociation is teach our\nbody that it's safe to be present and\nconscious the conscious check-in is a\nreally simple method that really works\nwhen I teach this in self-healer circle\nmy virtual Global healing community so\nmany people tell me that this simple\npractice has changed their life it\nreally worked for me too so here's how\nto create a conscious check-in you might\nwant to write these steps down one set a\nreminder on your phone you want this\nreminder to be at the same time every\nday this can be any time that works in\nyour day the reminder is going to say\nconscious check-in\ntwo when that alarm goes off stop\nwhatever you're doing for one to two\nminutes take three deep breaths from\nyour belly and notice how your body\nfeels is your neck tight are your\nshoulders tight then you're just going\nto notice whatever is around you if\nyou're near a window just look at the\ncolors of the trees if you're washing\nthe dishes notice the temperature of the\nwater and how the bubbles feel in your\nhands if you're having morning coffee\nnotice how the coffee smells and tastes\nwhen you're drinking it the conscious\ncheck-in uses your senses to bring you\nout of dissociation using your senses\nhelps you get out of your head and back\ninto your body you'll find that each\ntime you do this you are probably lost\nin thought worrying about things or just\ncompletely zoned out you have to teach\nyourself that it's safe to stop\ndissociating remember what I talked\nabout in my last video dissociation is a\nsurvival adaptation if you're\ndissociating there's nothing wrong with\nyou this is actually a way of protecting\nyourself so now you have to teach\nyourself that it's okay to be present\nit's safe to be in the present moment\nand you don't always need to check out\nor disconnect from it three continue for\n30 days repetition is key here this\nisn't something you can do once or twice\nyou need to really commit to this\npractice every day it's going to be a\nnew habit for you but what's great about\nthis habit is it only takes one to two\nminutes so it's really easy to fit into\nyour day a lot of people start really\nbig habits and when they can't show up\nfor them they feel even worse the more\nyou practice these new habits the more\nconfidence and awareness you're going to\nbuild four notice witness the shifts the\nfirst week notice how it feels to be\npresent for just a few minutes after the\nfirst week begin to notice all of the\ndifferent things around you that you're\nnow able to pay attention to throughout\nyour day notice how you're slowly more\nconscious and less dissociated and\ncelebrate as you even begin to notice\nwhen you're dissociating which is a\nreally good thing\nnow we're going to talk about a couple\ndifferent things you can do to support\nyour body through the process of coming\nout of the dissociated state here are\nthree things that you want to prioritize\nas you break your habit of\ndissociation the first thing is sleep\nyou want to make sure you're getting\nproper sleep we are more prone to\ndissociation when our resources are low\nbeing conscious actually takes a lot of\nenergy when you're like me and you've\ngone through life dissociating\nyour body will need all of its energy to\ncome out of dissociation or to get off\nthe spaceship as I call it so sleep is\nvery important the second thing is\nsunlight sunlight goes along with sleep\nbecause when we make sure that we get\nsunlight especially in the mornings it\nreally helps with our circadian rhythm\nso spend some time in the sun we need\nVitamin D for all of the processes in\nour body including becoming\nconscious the Third thing is boundaries\nthis is extremely important when we\ndissociate our nervous system is\noverwhelmed of course life will bring us\nstress there are a lot of things out of\nour control but when we're breaking the\nhabit of dissociation we really want to\nfocus on minimizing the stress and the\noverwhelm that we can control you'll\nwant to be aware of who you're spending\ntime with how you're spending time and\nmaking sure that you're setting clear\nboundaries around stressful people or\nexperience Es as you take these steps to\ncreate a new habit of being conscious\nyour body will be adjusting so you may\nfeel tired uncomfortable these are often\nsigns that you're getting more connected\nto your body and more present to the\nlife around you I hope this helped and I\nknow if you practice this method you're\ngoing to notice a lot of changes in your\nlife let me know in the comments when is\nit that you notice yourself dissociating\nthe most"
