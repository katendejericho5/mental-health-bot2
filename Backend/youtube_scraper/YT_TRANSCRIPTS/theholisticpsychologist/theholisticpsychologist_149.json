    "transcript": "do you blank out or feel numb do you\nhave almost no childhood memories or do\nyou have people share memories that\nthey've had with you and you're\ncompletely confused this Association is\nincredibly common I work with so many\npeople who experience this and they\ndon't really understand what's happening\nso today I'm going to talk about the\nfive signs of dissociation about six\nyears ago I was really struggling with\nthe fact that I didn't have any memories\nI don't remember much at all about my\nchildhood and I had these experiences\nwhere people would be like do you\nremember when you did this or remember\nwhen we were here and I'd be totally\nconfused a part of me would have this\nfeeling of the memory but I couldn't\nrecall the memory or the experience\nitself my partner would even say to me\nare you there are you listening to me\nright now because I had this checked out\nlook on my face I actually got to a\npoint in my life where I thought maybe I\nexperienced some kind of abuse when I\nwas young or that something really\ntraumatic must have happened that\nblocked Ed me from creating memories I\ndidn't grow up with what people would\nthink of as extreme traumatic abuse but\nI did grow up in a ton of stress and\nChaos my parents were too stressed and\ndistracted to meet my emotional needs\nand for a child there needs to be a safe\nand secure connection and environment an\nunsafe or unpredictable environment is a\ntraumatic experience so it would make\nsense that I would start dissociating or\ndisconnecting we associate as children\nwhen we don't feel safe in our\nenvironment but we know we can't escape\nthat environment so what do we do we\nfind a way to adapt or survive in the\nsituation the best way we know how we\nhave four ways our nervous system copes\nwith danger fight flight freeze or fun a\nlot of people talk about fight or flight\nbut freeze is a really common state that\npeople go into where they just shut down\nand become numb when we dissociate were\nphysically present but in this free\nstate if you've ever seen an animal\nthat's really scared and that just\ncompletely frees up not moving at all\nthis is an example of dorsal Bagel\nshutdown instead of running or trying to\nfight they're freezing or playing dead\nin order to avoid an attack human beings\ndo this too dissociation becomes our\ncoping mechanism and often a pattern in\nour lives where anytime there's an\nintense Trigger or extreme stress or\noverwhelm we go into that state so let's\nnow talk about the five signs of\ndissociation one memory loss as I talked\nabout earlier when we have patterns of\ndissociation we struggle with memory\nloss we're not forming memories because\nour body is concentrated only on\nSurvival we might lose chunks of time or\nbe confused if something happened or\ndidn't happen this makes a lot of sense\nbecause if you're completely overwhelmed\nor in danger your mind is is going to\nprotect you if you're not fully present\nin your body and in a disconnected State\nyour brain is going to struggle to make\nmemories so you might find yourself\nforgetting things misplacing things or\njust really struggling to keep up with\nyour tasks because you're so zoned out\ntwo\ndepersonalization this is when you feel\nlike you've completely left your body\nit's like you're watching yourself from\noverhead or outside of yourself you\nmight be confused or feel foggy about\nanything that's going on around you a\nlot of people describe it like they're\nliving in a dream you might feel really\napathetic or like there's no point to\nanything that nothing you do matters you\nmight be able to get things done like\nchores or work but it's almost like\nsomeone else is doing it you feel like\nyou're carrying out actions but you're\nnot really in control of those actions\nwhen you're dissociated you can be doing\nso many things day to day but you're not\nconnected or present in any of those\nthings you might come home at night and\nnot know what you did or be confused\nabout if if you did something because\nalmost all of your day you were\ndissociated three numbness you feel\nreally nothing so when something\nupsetting happens or something good\nhappens you're just flatlined a lot of\npeople talk about being unable to cry\neven when they want to when they're\ndissociated it's almost like a flip has\nswitched and you don't feel much of\nanything good or bad\nfour sore tight muscles when your body\ndissociates for a long period of time\nyou're in an immobilized state in that\nstate all of your muscles are going to\nget really tense from being frozen you\nmight have an overall feeling of\nexhaustion in your body some of that can\nbe from being in a mobilized state for\nlong periods of time\nfive chronic procrastination when you're\ndissociated your body is in the Free\nState a lot of people describe this as\nfeeling stuck inside their body maybe\nyou're thinking in your mind that you\nneed to take a shower you keep thinking\nand thinking about it but it's almost\nlike you're locked to your bed or the\ncouch or you're just scrolling and\nscrolling on social media you know you\nhave to do these things but your body\ncan't seem to move and get up and do\nthem a lot of people don't understand\nthat when our body is in a shutdown\nState we're procrastinating because our\nbody is trying to conserve energy we\nmight feel unmotivated or even worry\nthat we're lazy if you have these signs\nand you're realizing that you to\ndissociate there is no need to be\nconcerned dissociation is incredibly\ncommon and it actually means that your\nbody is working to protect you on my\nnext episode I'm going to teach you my\nmethod to stop dissociating and to be\nmore in your body this is something I\ncreated and by practicing it I really\ndid change my life make sure you\nsubscribe and turn on notifications to\nget an alert when that video comes out\nleave a comment below and let me know if\nyou relate to these signs and find\nyourself dissociating"
