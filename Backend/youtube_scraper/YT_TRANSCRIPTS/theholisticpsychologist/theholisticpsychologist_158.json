    "transcript": "I have avoidant attachment and feeling\nclose to someone is actually really\nactivating for me I had parents who were\nvery detached and sort of did their own\nthing so when you want to be close I\npanic because it feels completely\nuncomfortable I'm anxious attachment and\ndistance is very activating for me I had\nParents whose moods change all the time\nI had to stay close and monitor how they\nfelt to be safe so when you disconnect\nfrom me I panic and when you panic I\nfeel so much pressure I just completely\nshut down and when you shut down I feel\nlike you don't even care it brings me\nback to when I was little and no one\ncared about how I was doing or how\noverwhelmed I was and I can sense you're\nfeeling overwhelmed which makes me even\nmore shut down and smothered I just want\nto run away from it all I can sense you\non a run and it just confirms my learned\nbelief that I'm just too much and\neveryone I love will leave me"
