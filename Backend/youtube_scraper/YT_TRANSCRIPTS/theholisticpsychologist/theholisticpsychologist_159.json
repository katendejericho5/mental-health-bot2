    "transcript": "Dr. Nicole LePera: Today we're\ngoing to talk about avoidant\nattachment. Do you avoid\nrelationships or feel\nuncomfortable relying on anyone\nbut yourself? You might have an\navoidant attachment style.\navoidant attachment is developed\nwhen caregivers don't show\nemotional connection or\nattunement. So what does that\nmean? It can look like having a\nparent who's there take care of\nyour basic needs, but they're\nnot really able to give you\nemotional support or connection\nwhen you need it. A lot of\npeople describe this as having a\nparent who feels like a familiar\nstranger. Sometimes, avoidant\nattachment can develop from\nhaving a helicopter parent, or a\nparent who's emotionally\nsmothering and highly anxious.\nWe develop avoidant attachment\nbecause we have to suppress our\nown needs and our own struggles\nin order to be easy, or to keep\nthe connection with our\ncaregivers. If we know that our\nparent is going to ignore us, or\nget super anxious around our\nneeds, we pretend that we don't\nhave any needs at all. It's a\nsafest thing for us to do. A lot\nof people with avoidant\nattachment struggle asking for\nhelp trusting the people closest\nto them, and sometimes just\ncompletely check out of\nrelationships altogether because\nthey don't feel safe in them.\nThe core need in someone with\navoidant attachment is to feel\nindependent, or like the lone\nwolf. They don't like any\nfeeling of being smothered,\ntrapped, or not in control of a\nsituation. Because closeness\nfeels uncomfortable. They do all\nthey can to avoid emotional\nintimacy in relationships. Here\nare some signs of avoidant\nattachment, one, emotional\nrepression, you repeat the same\nchildhood pattern of denying\nyour needs or not talking about\nhow you feel sometimes leading\nto a blow up, or a complete\nshutdown, to fear of conflict.\nYou have a deep fear of any\nconflict even over small things,\nand might even become an extreme\npeople pleaser. To avoid it at\nall cost. Three, hyper\nindependence. You haven't I can\ndo it all persona, where you\ndon't ask for help. And you want\nto be fully independent, which\nmakes it difficult for you to\npartner with people or to share\na life with someone else. For\ncommitment fears. You have a\nfear of commitment, or go back\nand forth between sometimes\nfeeling really committed and\nother times really checked out.\nHere are some core triggers in\nrelationships for people with\navoidant attachment. One, a\nfeeling of being needed, you\nstruggle to accept the needs of\nothers. So being needed can\nactually be perceived as being\nsmothered to any conflict. Any\nsign of conflict can activate\nyour hyper independence, and you\ntry to avoid difficult\nconversations, or you shut down\nentirely. Three. Someone\nexpressing strong emotions, you\nstruggle with intense emotions,\nso when someone expresses them,\nyou might get really overwhelmed\nor not know how to support them\nat all. Having an avoidant\nattachment style can feel\noverwhelming because you do want\nto be close to people. But at\nthe same time, you have this\nstrong feeling of safety and\nsecurity with being independent\ncommitment can feel scary\nbecause it means the loss of\nfeeling safe and secure.\nsubscribe so that you can learn\nmore about other attachment\nstyles and how to develop a\nsecure attachment. If you\nresonate with avoidant\nattachment, leave it in the\ncomments. I'd love to know how\nthis shows up in your\nrelationships."
