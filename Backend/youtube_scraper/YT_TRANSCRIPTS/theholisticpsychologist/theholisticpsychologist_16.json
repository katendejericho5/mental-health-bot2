    "transcript": "my cooworker made this comment about me\nthe other day and I went back to my desk\nand all I could do was think about it\nwhat were you thinking I was just\nreplaying it over and over and I\ncouldn't get any work done I really\nwanted to go home and hide in my bed and\nsleep what was the comment about it was\nabout how long it took me to turn in a\nreport how she was waiting for it and\nshe said it in front of our other\ncoworker so this activated your wound\naround perfectionism someone made a\ncomment that made you feel exposed as\nnot being good enough and then you went\nto a shame spiral where that's all you\ncould think about yep I went home and I\nthought about it there too I had dinner\nplans that night and I canceled to binge\non Netflix and then I pictured all of\nthe things I could have said back to her\nbut didn't because I froze instead I\nhate that someone saying something can\nmake me spiral like this I wish I didn't\ncare you're really sensitive to other\npeople say because you carry a lot of\nShame one comment or reaction opens up\nthat shame wound and your body goes into\nfight or flight the way you know how to\nsooth is to self-isolate by canceling\nplans or to numb Yourself by watching\nNetflix in order to protect yourself"
