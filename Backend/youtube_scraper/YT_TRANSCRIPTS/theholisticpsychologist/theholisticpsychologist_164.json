    "transcript": "Today we're gonna talk about\nattachment styles. Attachment\nstyles are the ways you learned to\nrelate to other people, or how you\nshow up in your adult\nrelationships. Attachment styles\nwere created in the 1960s by\npsychiatrist John Bowlby, he found\nthat emotional and social\ndevelopment of an infant is\nprofoundly shaped by their\nrelationship with their primary\ncaretakers. This is a well\nresearched field that shows just\nhow important our early\nrelationships are. So how do we\ndevelop our attachment styles when\nwe're born and as we grow, we have\nphysical and emotional needs. If we\nhave caretakers who meet our needs\non a regular basis, we have secure\nattachments. This means that we\ntrust people, we feel safe and\ncomfortable in our relationships.\nIf we have caretakers who are\ndistracted, impatient, or just not\nemotionally attuned to us, we\ndevelop insecure attachment styles.\nThis means that we don't fully\ntrust people, we might fear\nabandonment, and we can often feel\noverwhelmed in our relationships. A\nreally simple example of how we\ndevelop an attachment style is to\nthink of a baby crying, because\nthey're hungry, they're hurt. If\nduring the first couple years of\ntheir life when they cry, they have\na caregiver that Sue's them by\nrocking them, or speaking in a soft\nkind voice, they'll more likely\nhave a secure attachment. If\nthey're left to cry alone if\nthey're ignored. Or if the parent\nis inconsistent in how they show\nup, they'll develop a more insecure\nattachment. This doesn't mean that\na parent always has to meet our\nneeds or be available to us. There\nwill always be moments where a\nparent may be unavailable for any\nreason, a difficult day at work, a\nstressful financial time or health\nissues. If the majority of the time\nthere is a consistent loving person\nwe know we can depend on and whose\nbehavior we can predict we will\nstill be securely attached. A\nsecure attachment childhood allows\nus the confidence to explore the\nworld independently, and also the\nsecurity to know that we can return\nhome for safety and support and\nadulthood. A secure attachment will\nallow us to feel worthy of being\nloved and feel like we can trust\nothers to support us when we need\nit. There are four different\nattachment styles, secure\nattachment, avoidant attachment,\nanxious attachment, and\ndisorganized attachment. I have a\nseries coming up that will break\ndown the different attachment\nstyles, so you'll want to subscribe\nto be sure you get those episodes.\nIf you already know your attachment\nstyle. Leave it in the comments.\nI'd love to hear from you."
