    "transcript": "Dr. Nicole LePera: If you can't\nparent your parents, what this\nmeans is you can't be\nresponsible for your parents\nissues or for their happiness. A\nlot of parents rely on their\nadult child to be their sole\nsupport system. And an adult\nchild who's highly sensitive\nwill feel an intense sense of\nresponsibility to fix their\nproblems. They'll go into fixer\nmode, caretaking mode, trying to\nmake things better. The way to\nbreak out of this cycle is to\nfirst become aware that you're\nstuck in it. So here's what the\ncycle looks like the parent\nvents to their adult child, they\nshare their ongoing issues, and\nthe adult child understandably\nfeels an intense sense of\nsympathy for their parents\nstruggle. As a result, the adult\nchild then goes into problem\nsolving mode, they feel\nunderstandably helpless seeing\ntheir parents struggle, they\nbegin to offer their perspective\nsolutions suggestions, sometimes\neven encouraging their parents\nto change. Their parent,\nhowever, continues to vent about\ntheir problems without taking\nany feedback or making any\nchanges at all. They continue to\nneed more and more time and\nattention from their adult\nchild. And if they sense that\ntheir child is pulling away in\nany way, shape or form, they\nbegin to guilt trip them. The\nadult child understandably\nbegins to feel frustrated and\nresentful at the situation. No\nmatter what they do. It's not\nenough, the situation continues.\nSo they of course, then begin to\nfeel even more guilty and more\nshameful. The parent continues\nto vent about their ongoing\nissues. And so the cycle\ncontinues. In this situation,\nthere are core needs of both\npeople. The adult child has a\ncoordinate to stay in that fixer\nor that caretaker role. The\nparents coordinate is for\nconstant support and attention.\nThe issue or the conflict is\nboth feel helpless, as nothing\nchanges or nothing gets solved.\nSome signs that you might be\nstuck in this cycle, you feel\ndrained and resentful. You might\nsee your parents calling and you\ndon't want to answer but you\nfeel too guilty not to. You\nmight even begin to notice that\nyour needs and your\nrelationships are suffering or\nbeing neglected entirely. Take a\nmoment. Explore your own\nrelationship with your parents\nto notice if you might be stuck\nin this cycle. So were you\nparenting your parent? Leave a\ncomment below. I'd love to hear\nyour situation.
