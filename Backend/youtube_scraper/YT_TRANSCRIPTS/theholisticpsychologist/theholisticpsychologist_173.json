    "transcript": "oh just get over it how come you never\napologize when you're wrong or when you\nhurt someone in our family honey you're\na child why would I apologize to a child\nbecause I'm also a human being and when\nyou hurt someone it's important to\napologize and repair after the situation\nhoney repair is for household appliances\nso how do you think I'll learn\naccountability in relationships what how\ndo you think I'll learn to be\naccountable for how I impact the people\nclose to me a lot of the times you say\nreally hurtful things and then you go on\nacting like nothing happened so I'm just\nwondering how I'll learn to not be that\nway here we go blame the parents for\neverything see that's another example of\na lack of accountability to be\naccountable we need to stop being\ndefensive and listen to how other people\nexperience us if the person has a valid\npoint we can be empathetic and apologize\nthis shows people we value their\nemotions and allows them to trust us I\nhave a valid point here and you're just\ndismissing it you know what the problem\nis with kids these days they want\nexplanation they want to talk about\nfeelings when I was growing up if I\ntalked to my dad like this he would have\ngiven me the belt things were better\nwhen kids were terrified and actually\nrespected Elders okay here's what I'm\nlearning being accountable and listening\nto how other people feel isn't important\nthe best thing to do is invalidate the\npeople around me and act like they're\nthe one with the problem the way you\nwere raised has had a dramatic effect on\nyou and you're not really aware of that\nyet you shut down anytime someone talks\nabout how they feel and you've had a\nseries of relationships with dismissive\nabuse of men who are just like your\nfather including dad healthy\nrelationships don't involve fearing\nsomeone they involve true respect and\ntrue respect comes from listening and\nletting people know you care about how\nthey feel"
