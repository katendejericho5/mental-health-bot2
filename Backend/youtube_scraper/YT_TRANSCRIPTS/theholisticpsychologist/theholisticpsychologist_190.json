    "transcript": "foreign\nhere today by someone you might have\nunknowingly seen in a movie Kimberly\nShannon Murphy is a leading Hollywood\nstuntwoman who has performed in more\nthan 100 feature films and TV shows\nshe's here with me today to discuss her\nnewest book glimmer A Story of Survival\nhope and healing where she talks about\nher childhood history of abuse and her\njourney of healing dysfunctional family\nDynamics as she enters into Parenthood\nherself so you're going to want to\nlisten to this one she speaks very\ncandidly and openly about all these\nvulnerable topics stay tuned Kimberly\nShannon Murphy thank you so much for\njoining me thank you so much for even\noffering me to have eyes on your book\nbook glimmer that we're going to be\ntalking about in just a minute before it\nwas published and like I was sharing\nwith you before we tuned on to sign on\nto this interview I was just so struck\nwith how vulnerable you shared so much\nof your own healing journey and knew\nthat I needed to not only endorse the\nbook itself but to have you on this\nchannel for a conversation because I\nknow so many of us feel so alone in our\nstruggles and you so candidly write\nabout topics that you know aren't\nnecessarily so freely discussed and in\nand of itself I know many of our\nlisteners are going to feel the healing\npower of being connected even through\ndifficult experiences when we feel a\nlittle less alone at least as far as I'm\nconcerned if we feel a little more able\nto look at the difficult things in our\nlife so thank you thank you thank you\nfor not only putting out your work the\nbook glimmer that we're going to be\ntalking about here today but for sharing\nyour story and your journey here with us\nnow thank you\nso uh let's get started I'm actually\ninterested in the title itself your book\nglimmer with the subtitle A Story of\nSurvival hope and healing what made you\nname the book glimmer I'm interested in\nin that concept for you and how it came\nto be the title of of your book\num\nthrough the writing of my book the last\nthree years\nI realized that my glimmer was actually\nmy inner child\nand that came out through the writing\num of course when you do the proposal\nfor the book you always have these names\nthat I never resonated with me and that\nand I remember my editor just saying\nit will all come when it's supposed to\nand it it just did it just felt like\nthat my I've been doing a lot of inner\nchild work and I think that she's always\nbeen the one who's kept that spark in me\ngoing and who's been pushing me from\ninside myself without me even knowing\nand so my glimmer essentially is my\ninner child that's so beautiful even\nhearing you describe it not only its\npresence and I imagine we're going to\ndive all into what we mean when we say\ninner child what you meant how it was\nfor you to come in contact or reconnect\nwith that inner being and of course heal\nand really interestingly kind of hearing\nyou describe it as a Sparkle and\nacknowledge not only their presence but\njust from a clinical lens glimmers and\npolyvagal Theory which a lot of my work\nis you know kind of touches on are\nactually signals of safety\num so it's kind of ironic I think in so\nmany ways that you're describing this\ninner spark of being and of course a\nbeing that as we dive into this\nconversation wasn't necessarily kept\nsafe but seeing that reflect it in in\nyour book I think was really what drew\nme to even asking this question so let\nme ask you what three years ago\num what kind of inspired you to put your\nstory down as you did in in the pages of\na book why three years ago why a book in\ngeneral\nI've been wanting to write a book for 20\nyears but\nnot in the headspace to do it and I\nmy family system in general is extremely\ntoxic a lot of people have chosen not to\ndo the healing work and so I think\nfor a long time being a part of my\nfamily system was more important than\ntaking care of myself I can see that now\nwhen I couldn't see that then\num so when covet happened I don't do\nwell sitting still\num office recent so I just\nsaid this is the time I'm just gonna do\nit\nand I found a Ghostwriter and everything\njust happened really easily it was\nalmost like the universe was just sort\nof guiding me that this was the right\ntime to do it and\nso we did a proposal and we you know you\nknow all the things you have to do to\nkind of sell a book and when we were\nlooking for comps for my book we\ncouldn't find any and going through the\nprocess of writing it I now know why\nbecause the hardest thing I've ever done\nin my life\num and so\nyeah and then that really I think when I\nstarted writing the book I thought that\nI had done so much work which I had I\nhad done so much therapy and I had done\na lot of work on myself but I hadn't\nreally\ndone as much work as I thought\nand so going through the process of\nwriting the book and reading the words\non the page that were my life\nand then now when we did the audiobook\nand hearing someone else I didn't read\nit I had one of my actresses read it\nbecause it was just too emotional for me\nto I didn't want the engineer to be\nthere for three years trying to get the\nwords out of my mouth\num\njust hearing someone speak your life is\nvery surreal\nand it\nmade me have a lot of Revelations of how\nneglected I was how abused I was how\nlittle support was available to me and\nit made me re-evaluate a lot of\nrelationships in my life\nyeah thank you um for sharing all that\nand you know all topics that I think\nwe're going to dive into you know from\nkind of the work you chose you know\num to do what you did this idea of the\ntoxic family and you know kind of coming\nto these realizations these truths and\nall that you've had to navigate and\nhearing that come up again in terms of\nwriting the book and what was the actual\nyou know kind of process like as you\nbegan to you know on Earth I guess again\nthese stories because what you're\ntalking about I think is going to\nresonate with a lot of us\num whether or not it's kind of us\nretelling or going into a deeper level\nof healing you know based on past\nexperiences that maybe we've come to the\nawareness of at some point in the past\nor you know a lot of people I will often\nhear you know oh I'm feeling like I bet\nyou know some kind of groundedness or\nstate of healing and then I find or find\nmy way into this new relationship or a\nspecific relationship or I go back to my\nyou know family relationships and I'm\nthen hit again with a wash of all of\nthis stuff again so what was I mean what\ndo you make of the process for you and\nkind of revisiting it and what were the\nthe difficult aspects of it aside from\nkind of hearing of someone else tell\nyour story how is it for you to I guess\ngo back down this memory lane in this\nvery directed way with the intention of\nknowing I think that's another part of\nit right that is going to go in these\npages of a book um did you have I'm just\nthinking of my own process I know for me\nsharing you know a lot of my own journey\nand in my past book and a book I'm\nworking on now I internally had moments\nlike you're saying worrying about\nprotecting you know other people and how\nare they going to receive it for me that\nwas very strong\num and there was like an internal sensor\neven as I was writing the words on the\npage and revisiting them myself and\nfeeling all the feelings about that\nhaving happened and then another voice\nin my head wondering if I should tone it\ndown if I should word it a different way\nor shift it or remove it entirely\nbecause how will it be for it to not\nonly be in front of stranger's eyes but\nyou know family members or other people\nthat were closer to me so I don't know\nif you had a similar experience or how\nis it that I guess then you navigate it\nnot only having these feelings come\ncoming up but this you know reality of\nother people going to lay eyes on so\nmuch of your childhood yeah it's really\nI think when I got a book when I got the\nbook deal\num I felt like I needed to call all of\nmy family and just get this validation\nfrom them that it was okay that I was\ndoing this and it was okay that I was\ntelling my story that that I that I\nneeded that support from them at the\ntime and as I started making the phone\ncalls because in the book we have a\nfictitious sister in my in my in the\nbook but I actually have three sisters\nand so my one sister\nwho we had very different childhoods\nbecause we're very far apart in years\nand since my abuser died when I was 11\nwe just didn't have a similar childhood\num her reaction to me was you're gonna\nruin everyone's life you're gonna ruin\nall the kids lives like you're you're\nhurting me I and that was her reaction\nto it and I just felt like I needed to\nmake everything okay for her and she was\nworried about how I was going to depict\nmy father in the book and then my other\nsister completely just ghosted me I\nhaven't talked to her since I got my\nbook deal\num and I think that those things needed\nto happen for me because I needed to\nreally see how toxic my family was still\nand they and the toxicity that we were\nall still existing in and that I was\nstill participating in it and so some of\nthem chose to walk away from me and I\nchose to walk away from some of them and\nI think I needed that in order to\nactually write my truth the way that I\ndid because if I was constantly worried\nabout what someone was going to feel or\nsomeone was going to say I wasn't able\nto fully speak my truth with that said I\ndidn't write the book to hurt anybody I\nwrote the book to help survivors I mean\nI\nI feel like we did a really good job my\nmain goal was I don't want to be super\ntriggering to anybody who's been through\nsimilar abuse I want to write it in a\nway where you understand the severity of\nthe abuse but it's not out there in\nplain bold letters so that the people\nthat I'm trying to help just close the\nbook and put it away I want this to be a\nbook for people like me\nto be able to go to and feel inspired\nthat you can get through something so\nhorrific and you can get to the other\nside and you can heal and that it's all\na process but I think I needed to do\nthat without the people that made me\nsick in the first place\nyeah I want to commend you for your\nstrength your courage Your resilience to\nyou know be faced with again another\nreally pivotal moment of making that\nchoice of standing in your own truth\num with the passion and purpose behind\nit like you're beautifully describing\nand we're tending to or the other kind\nof voice in the head of concerns about\ntending to other people and I know then\nwhen we're wired and I talk often about\nyou know our actual nervous system and\nthese states of protection that are\nquite literally you know wired into our\nmind and body it becomes really\ndifficult as logically as you know I\ncould profess from the rooftop how\nimportant your truth is and to stand in\nyou know your narrative and affirm\nyourself regardless of what people think\nthe reality of it is it's really\ndifficult to do that especially when you\nknow this this trauma this coping\nmechanism even of deferring to other\npeople is is so ingrained in us which\nreally brings me to that you you did a\nwonderful job I think in terms of\num you know actualizing that purpose I I\nwas just so struck you can't see in\nfront of me but I have two whole sheets\nwith just beautiful quotes\num the way I'm just such a sucker for\nwords and quotes and the way you word it\nand talked about and navigated talking\nabout and languaging some really\ndifficult topics was I mean a word I\nwill dare say it was beautiful in my\nopinion and I imagine that many readers\nyou know who have been through a similar\nexperience my hope is that exactly like\nyou're intending you did kind of word\nyour journey in a way that you know\ncould feel approachable I mean like I\nsaid even kind of giving language that\nis so so touching to such difficult\ntopics and one of the things that struck\nme from the beginning even just kind of\ndiving into now what I even mean when I\nsay kind of wired into us and you know\nour experiences of this past really do\ncome with us even if we're you know away\nand we've cut relationships with these\ntoxic humans a lot of those patterns\nstill are ingrained in us and you write\nin the book long before I had memories I\nhad my dolls I cared for them and I\nprotected them I think I envied them\nforgetting to be pretty and safe we were\na lot alike Perfection on the outside\nHollow on the inside what had bought we\nhad bodies but no free will histories we\ncouldn't speak of but carried in our\nfibers I have chills reading this\num I'm really struck by this you know\nkind of\npretty and safe right and kind of how\nyou know those two concepts you know\nplayed into your child experience and\nalso this kind of juxtaposition of right\nthis idea of what we're showing on the\noutside yet internally this and I really\nresonate personally with a feeling of of\nhollowness of course for different\nhistorical reasons though that really\nreally struck me um of course in\naddition to this idea of we live our\nhistories even if we don't have\nconscious knowledge and even if it isn't\npart of our shared family narrative\nwhich I know was a big part of your\njourney so can you speak a little bit of\nyou know kind of that quote and you know\nkind of that that feeling early in\nchildhood before even you I think you\nknow were made aware of these deep\nrooted\num this history if you will that you\ncouldn't speak of but that you carried\nand what kind of that early stage I\nthink it comes in even I'm interested in\nthe three names of the parts that you\nsplited the book up it comes in this\nidea of splitting right this idea that\nthere's two internal outernal um\nexternal it's made up a word um like\nwrite these ideas that there's these two\nyou know aspects of myself to even\nrealities right the deeper suppressed\none of what was actually happening and\nthen the reality that everyone was kind\nof tending to or acknowledging that\nwasn't necessarily actually happening\naround you\nyes I think there was a lot of confusion\nfor me because my abuse started so young\nI was probably two or three when it\nstarted I didn't know any other life\nbut I knew that it didn't feel right or\ngood or okay and it was really confusing\nto me because not only was this horrific\nthing happening to me and on a very\nregular basis because I saw my\ngrandfather often\nbut that the adults in my life weren't\ndoing anything about it and so to me I\nthink I just had this sense of well this\nis life this is just what it is this is\nwhat we do this is kind of quote unquote\nmy job\num\nI didn't know any other way and so even\nthough deep down it didn't feel good or\nright\nI didn't I couldn't explain in my\nfour-year-old head or five-year-old had\nand it in any other way then this is\njust what every family must do this is\njust what must happen because anything\nelse was to mature for me to wrap my\nhead around at that stage of my life\num so\nI feel like\nin that sense\nI was always been the truth teller in\nthe family which has caused a lot of\nkind of Rift and and growing up in a\nfamily where everyone wants to stuff\neverything under the rug and just sort\nof move on and and it really started\nwith my grandmother and her\nperfectionism and I come you know now I\nI feel like there are names for things\nthat there weren't names for back then\nor at least I didn't know the names for\nthem and I grew up with many narcissists\nobviously and there was so much\ngaslighting and so much manipulation\nhappening and it feels good now as an\nadult to be able to look at those words\nand the definitions and understand that\nthat's what was happening to me and then\nthat what was actually going on in my\nlife and there's an actual clinical word\nfor it and it's actually abuse\num so Not only was I dealing with and\nit's interesting because you know Dr\nmate who's become a good friend of mine\nand\num\nbeen amazing through my process as well\nsaid something to me and I write this in\nthe book too he said you know our first\nconversation and he said I want you to\nknow that your first trauma was not your\nabuse\nthat it was your first trauma was that\nyou were separated from any adult\nsupport which is how the abuse happened\nin the first place\nand when he said that it sort of turned\nmy world upside down because\nI've still been yearning to have these\nrelationships with these adults who\nultimately didn't protect me and weren't\nthere physically mentally for because of\ntheir own trauma and that's the whole\npoint of me really\nhaving this importance of writing my\nstory because\nyou pass it on to your children in any\nway and and it may not be the sexual\nabuse but it's the it's the trauma from\nthe sexual abuse and how that manifests\ninside of you and then how you then\nraise your children or your partner or\nwhoever you're with in your life and\nthat was a really big one that took me a\nlittle that took me a minute to swallow\nthat\nyeah I I imagine I appreciate you\nsharing that um here with us Kimberly\nand what you're describing even going\nback to right this this instinctual\nfeeling you had as a child right you\nknow at an age like more like beginnings\nof pre-verbal right shifting into just\ngetting language for the first time and\nyou know when overwhelming events happen\nat that age not only can't we can't\ndescribe it to ourselves like you said\nwe don't have the maturity to zoom out\nand understand all the Dynamics that\nhave created the circumstances of\nsuffering of abuse that we've\nexperienced yet internally we have that\nfeeling of something's not right but in\nabsence of that being reflected by the\nyou know external narrative by someone\nacknowledging and supporting how not\nright it is or affirming that intuition\nwill defer because we need those\ncaregivers we're physically dependent on\nthem we're emotionally dependent on them\nso our our feelings our instincts get\nsquashed beneath the surface and we then\nbelieve what's happening around us based\nin that set of State state of dependency\nand also like you're describing based on\nour lack of emotional maturity and I\nthink it's really interesting and\nnotable I appreciate you not only\nacknowledging you know the fact that you\nyou suffered at the hands of abuse right\nso there was a perpetrator if you will\nthough you're also highlighting and\nexpanding the focus to the whole system\nI mean you you know you began by\nacknowledging I come from a toxic family\nsystem and you're you know kind of as Dr\nmate kind of brought to your own\nawareness that there were other people\naround right either that were blind to\nthis or weren't creating the safety for\nyou to be able to engage a conversation\nor bring your reality to light sooner\nthan you did and I think sometimes you\nknow because of course you know focus\nand acknowledging the perpetrator and\nthe abuses is part of the healing\nJourney though it's it's not as often\nthat I see people so readily saying\nthough it was everyone else involved and\nyou know a lot of times I hear you know\nwe have an explosive parent and oh well\nyou know the parent who's not not as\nexplosive or the you know kind of go\nwith the flow parent gets kind of\nhighlighted as you know being Valiant\nbecause they're not exploding but it's\nwhat are they doing when the explosions\nare happening and it still is a form of\nabuse and you actually again I'm very\nres much resonating with the way you\ndescribe your mom\num in particular and you say she mom\nlooks back with nothing it's that look\nI've known my entire life you could snap\nyour fingers in front of her face and\nshe wouldn't even blink I always thought\nthat she was tired it never occurred to\nme that she was this way before even us\nit dawned on me mom was a little girl\nonce a little girl let down by her\nmother and I'm resonating having a very\nsimilar mom who was so dissociated\num based on events that you know\npredated even any of my siblings who are\nvery much like your own experience much\nolder in age\num they'll come in that reality and you\nknow having that awareness I think\nreally describes what you're just you're\ntalking about here which is it wasn't\njust the perpetrator it was it was Mom\nand how was that for you to you know\ncome to that realization that Mom wasn't\nor you know at least in the way you\ndescribe it here wasn't present to you\nis kind of the language that my mind\nhears when I read this quote\nuh yeah my mom\num\nit's been that's been a difficult one\nfor me because my mom really tries and\nshe's been in therapy for a really long\ntime but as I always say you can be in\ntherapy for 50 years and if you're not\nworking with the right person you're not\nhealing so\num\nI think that that's a difficult thing\nmy mom it's it's almost like\nshe has acknowledged obviously\nacknowledged everything that has\nhappened it happened to her\num but I do feel she's the one person in\nthe family who I still do talk to\num and we've done a lot of therapy\ntogether we've done a lot of work\ntogether you know I I did leave things\nout in the book\num one which\nI wasn't going to speak about but have\nopenly spoken about which I think is\nimportant\num when we speak about the grooming of\nthe perpetrator and how strong that\nactually is on a child\num there was a few times that my mom did\nwalk in when things were happening to me\nand he had so much control over her that\nshe\nhe told her to leave and she did\nand so again for me as a child\njust having that moment is like okay\nwell\nthis is just what we do and Mom\nobviously is okay with it but in my\nmom's words if you were to speak to her\nnow about it she doesn't you know it was\njust like\nyou know nothing was there it was just\nhe had\nabused her so long and and in her life\nthat he had this control over her like\nnobody else and so\nthat is what enabled him to be able to\ndo it to me\nbecause he knew that he could control\nher and you know he didn't abuse me when\nI was by myself he abused me at parties\nI mean people were upstairs people were\naround it wasn't like you know I was\ndropped off and in a room with him and\nthings were happening it was like there\nwas many adults around when this was\ngoing on and that's why I talk a lot\nabout just in general you know know\nwhere your kids are like know where they\nare I mean I don't care how well you\nknow somebody I just you know I have a\ndaughter now so that's obviously been\nreally\num sort of the Catalyst for me writing\nthis book too because\nI\nfeel like it's so important for her to\nyou know obviously when it's appropriate\nin her life for her to know my story for\nher to know where I come from so that\nshe can understand that\nyou know Mommy may have overreacted in\nthis situation but I can understand why\nand that I'm working on myself and I am\ndoing my best and I do think that\nso often as parents we\nwant to just shove everything down and\nthink that that's the best way to do\nthings and then just say okay well this\nhappened and I'm just moving on and I'm\nnow I'm going to be a parent and I'm\ngonna parent my child and I I've watched\nthat happen in my family with my\nfamily's children and it doesn't fare\nwell\nyeah it doesn't and again I you know\nwant to continue to acknowledge the The\nBravery to you know begin to engage\nthese these conversations because for so\nmany of us you know your mom even\nincluded like you're sharing\num it becomes just what we do right we\nget so afraid of and in those moments\nbrought right back to the moments where\nwe were a child and dependent and unable\nto exert a different level of boundaries\nand power and say no I'm not leaving\nwhat's happening here right and I think\nthat that story um or that moment you\nknow that was incredibly painful for you\nyou know kind of from Mom's lens you\nknow it's really illustrates how that\nand all of the trauma stored in her own\nbody can override right something even\nobjectively real\num that she you know entered into and\nand you kind of go into more and you\ndescribe\num you know this early tendency\num to you know that you taking on the\nrole of what you you say is kind of\ntrying to ease mom worries mom's worry\nand you acknowledge I'm still a good\ngirl mostly my priorities are simple and\nautomatic again this idea of automatic\nreally describing how these are wired\nthey're just our instincts they're what\nwe do and for a significant part of your\nyears\num your priorities simple and automatic\nwe're staying alive excelling at\ncheerleading dance or gymnastics and\ntrying to ease mom's worry so all this\nagain just kind of speaks to how\ninstinctual you were kind of feeling\nwhat was happening you were feeling the\nneed to ease mom's worries the need to\nyou know perform and Excel in these\ncertain ways as not only your means to\nstay alive but to stay safe because I\nthink for a lot of us you know in\nchildhood we develop adaptations which\nmight be performing like you did and can\nyou say a little bit of you know how it\nwas that you know gymnastics and that\nkind of physical practices of\ncheerleading and dance and everything\nthat you engaged in kind of what role\nyou think Looking Back Now that played\num for you so early on in term terms of\nnot only easing mom's worries but maybe\nnavigating what was happening for you\ninternally in the home\nI think it gave me an identity I think\nthat\nfor a really long time I\ndidn't know who I was without my\ngrandfather\nI didn't have an identity without him\nbecause\nI was introduced to the abuse at such a\nyoung age so I didn't know who I was\nwithout him\nand I know that sounds really twisted\nbut\num\nwhen he died I almost didn't know what\nto do with myself although I had so much\nfeeling of relief and and happiness and\nconfusion as to why I wasn't sad but I\nwasn't sad\num but I think it gave me a nice a sense\nof identity\nand I think also interestingly enough I\nthink it was\nsubconsciously A coping mechanism for me\num Dr Bruce Perry had said to me on one\nof our conversations you know you were\nhealing yourself without even knowing it\njust by moving your body and all the\nthings that you were doing in a healthy\nway you know so many of us when we've\nhad abuse\nthere's vast amount of things that can\nhappen obviously addiction and you know\nI had bulimia I was a cutter I did some\nthings that were not positive but I\nthink Dance and Gymnastics were a\npositive outlet for me to get my\nemotions out\nand I'm really struck by you describing\num your identity right being connected\nwithin this relationship with your with\nyour grandfather and I you know I think\nit's very understandable when we're in\nchildhood you know we're hypothetically\nright needing to have a free safe secure\nspace to begin to explore humans who are\ncurious about who we are many times\nright based on how we're interacting\nwith them simply to say we learn who we\nare we do develop our identity in\nrelationship with those core caregivers\nthat we're reliant on so you know from\nthat psychological lens when we you know\ntalk about this you know very elusive\nconcept sense of self and identity and\nwhere that comes from I mean you're very\nbeautifully describing the reality of it\nwe're not solo on an island when we're\nborn we're actually embedded in at least\none primary relationship with whoever\nthe caregiver is that is you know tasked\nwith keeping us physically alive though\noften we're embedded in a dynamic\nrelationship with a family with other\npeople like you're saying this was\nsomeone who I spent consistent time with\nso I think through that lens it's really\nunderstandable and astute for you to\nkind of acknowledge that there was part\nof my identity that was kind of adhered\nto the abuse that happened before me and\nyou you go on\num again to another I feel like I'm\nplucking a lot of comments that you know\nI for very different historical reasons\nagain resonate with personally and\nanother aspect of your identity you\ncomment on\num when you kind of catch yourself I\nthink apologizing for something and you\nsay why am I apologizing I've been\nworking on this\num this is when you know a shift has\nhappened in terms of your awareness of\nthe abuse at this part of the book and\nYou Begin your healing Journey so why am\nI apologizing I've been working on this\nI know why I say star sorry for every\ndamn thing it's because deep down I\nblame myself for what he did I also\nblame myself for causing my family Pain\nby stirring the pot and making them look\nat the reality of our past my sorryness\nis stored in my bones I want it out so\nagain kind of highlighting these\nidentities and even this responsibility\nversion of an identity that I do think a\nlot of victims carry with them that they\ndon't necessarily talk about you know\nbecause it feels like to blame myself\nfor what happened to me like how could I\ndo that I'm a child and you know that\nmature part of our mind Zooms in it's\nlike well you shouldn't do that\num though in reality I think what you're\ndescribing is a very real part of the\nidentity process which is that we do\nassume a level of responsibility and you\ndescribe it so beautifully\nthank you yeah I think that I always\nfelt that I didn't have shame and I\ndidn't have guilt for what was done to\nme because\nin my brain I didn't\nand I didn't realize how much it was\nactually just stored in my system and\nthat it was coming out in these other\nways because it's very easy to say oh I\nknow it wasn't my fault I know that I\ndidn't do anything wrong I know well of\ncourse you know that because\nyou were a child and this person was an\nadult and this was not okay and that's\nwhat the world says but it doesn't mean\nthat\nit's not stored somewhere in your body\nand coming out in different\nways and I think such an important thing\nand I think why it's so difficult for\npeople to really get to a healing space\nwhen you've gone through something so\ndramatic traumatic\nis because\nwe cannot heal around the people that\nhave made us sick\nand that doesn't mean that I'm when I\nspeak about my family I know my\ngrandfather was the Catalyst and the\nperson who made me sick who who who did\nthis abusive you know thing to me over\nand over and over again but\nthen the family starts moving in this\ntoxic you know sort of way\nand when I started branching off and and\ntrying other things and other healing\nmethods and doing other other sort of\nwork I it almost felt like I was\nstanding under an umbrella alone and I\njust wanted like all my family to like\nget under the umbrella and you know I'm\nlike over here going like no come over\nhere like we can do this like it's it's\nactually possible we don't have to live\nlike this and we don't have to\nwalk on eggshells around each other and\nbe triggered all the time and and we can\ndo this in a safe space and I realized\nvery quickly that I could not do that\nand that was a difficult one for me for\nsure\ncan you say a little more about that as\nyou're you know shifting it into healing\nbecause I you're describing I think very\nnatural something I hear quite often\nfrom members of the community which is a\nvery understandable like want to bring\nour loved ones Under the Umbrella\nespecially if we know that you know they\nwere part of these dysfunctional\num Cycles so how was you know kind of\nwhat were the moments when you came to\nrealize or you know what were the\nfactors that helped you and how was it\nthen to come to that you know what can\nmany of us be a really devastatingly\ndisappointing reopening up a wound in a\nlot of ways moment or Choice points of\nlike well what am I gonna do now you\nknow I can have this want and at the\nsame time I can see what's you know\nhappening in reality\nyeah I think with my father it was very\ndifficult I haven't spoken to him now in\na year\num and he was a difficult one for me\nbecause\nrealizing that my dad is a complete\nnarcissist was something that I really\nhad to come to terms with and he did not\nhave an easy life and this is what I\nmean about the trauma just passing down\nhe didn't have an easy life and went to\nVietnam when he was 18 and was in the\nwar for two years and then when he came\nout he never did any work to sort of\ndeal with it or you know utilize the VA\nin any way and so I know that he lived\nwith a lot of pain and a lot of scarring\nbecause of that\num\nbut I think a it's a generational thing\nI think that generation isn't doing what\nthis generation is doing thank god\num and with him it was difficult because\nI would get on the phone and I would try\nto have these conversations with him and\nthey were never conversations it was\njust him you know kind of like a broken\nrecord saying the same thing over and\nover and and\nwith that said he was supportive of me\nwriting the book and saying you know I\nthink it's going to help a lot of people\nand I think you should do it\num\nbut\nwe were always having the same\nconversations and nothing was ever being\nresolved from them\nand so\nsomething had happened over the summer\nwhere my daughter was affected and in\nsense of she was left out because nobody\nwanted to be around me and so\nI had to explain to her you know to sit\nthere with my eight-year-old and for\nthat was the moment for me that changed\neverything because I saw my family's\ntrauma bleeding out onto my child who\nasked for none of this and it was the\nexact thing I was fighting for and now I\nhad to have a conversation with her\nbecause of it that I didn't want to have\nto have\nbut because she was left out and her\neight-year-old mind she said mommy what\ndid I do why doesn't anyone want to see\nme why can't I see my cousins I love my\ncousin's mommy I'm so uh so it was such\na painful moment as a parent\nbut also such an eye-opening moment for\nme to acknowledge that no this stops\nlike right here she is not gonna feel a\nsliver of how I grew up a sliver of of\nthis is my fault what did I do because\nshe's a beautiful human with a beautiful\nheart and she's a child and she deserves\nto feel loved and safe and accepted and\nall of the things that I never was\nand so for me I kind of just sat down\nand I wrote my father a letter because I\nknew trying to talk to him about it\nwasn't gonna happen and I you know sort\nof said all the things you know these\nare the things that happened when I was\na child that really haven't now affected\nme and I'm trying to work through them\nand I left the letter saying you know\nthere's options we can heal Dad this is\nnot I'm not saying goodbye to you I'm\nsaying we have to do things differently\nor I can't do them at all\nand I never heard back from him after\nthat\nthank you for sharing that again as I\nimagine you know bringing that to mind I\ncan even hear the emotion in your voice\nand I want to acknowledge you yet again\nKimberly for your your choice in that\nmoment\num as difficult as it was to honor what\nyour truth was to you know tell your\nvery young daughter the reasons to give\nher you know the explanation of why\nshe's having the experience of\ndisconnection of distance of people not\nwanting to be present in her life\nbecause that's a gift\num I think a lot of us you know we we\nthink for very well-intentioned reasons\nthat we're protecting our children by\nyou know not telling them certain things\nthough much like in your own childhood\nwhen you don't have someone explaining\nto you why things are happening that are\nyou know causing you suffering or why\nanything that's happening we don't have\nthat level of understanding we will come\nup with an explanation and when we're in\nthose Prime developmental years that the\nversion of the explanation that we're\ngoing to land on is is not that it's not\nmy fault it's actually the way you you\nknow beautifully as we just talked about\nit's that there is something inherently\nwrong wrong with me I'm the cause of\nthese behaviors because developmentally\nwe can't understand otherwise so parents\nlike yourself who are having difficult\nconversations and and telling our kids\nyou know another version of of a reason\nwhy she's having those painful\nexperiences of disconnection is such a\nsuch a great gift and I think this\ninvites us to talk a bit about you know\nkind of your your process of getting you\nknow finding out that you know you you\nwere pregnant as you're beginning to\nacknowledge like we talked earlier of\nyour inner child and right this space\nwhere all of this wounding from this\npast you know is housed within you and\nall these coping tendencies that you've\ndeveloped over the years from\ndisconnection to right channeling it in\nwhat could be you know functional or\nadaptive Society you know ways of being\nactive and also some some non-adaptive\nones kind of really again highlighting\nall of this trauma inside of you and now\nbecoming to realize that you have this\ninner child space this glimmer and it's\ncarrying the wounding and also the spark\nthat is you and now you're being given\nthe information right you have another\nyou have a child Along coming along and\nnow you are going to be the parent and\nyou again as you've done throughout the\nbook\num you touch on I think an important\nconversation for other you know women to\nhear expectant mothers people who are\nyou know already mothers themselves\nsomething that's not so talked about\nwhich is what is the impact then of of\nyour own past when you you know are\nhaving your own child and you write\num about nursing and the first time we\ntried nursing my abuse memory surged up\nfrom deep inside of me the closeness the\nsensations the feeling of giving one's\nbody over to another can cause can\ntrigger flashbacks stress hormones even\ndissociation and again I want to just\nthank you for so candidly describing\nthat you know this very joyous occasion\nright that many of us I think shame\nourselves out of when we do have these\nexperience of it not being joyous of it\nbeing difficult of it even as you have\nhad experience of bringing up right\nthese very difficult painful moments so\ncan you speak to a little bit about kind\nof what your journey of finding out that\nyou were pregnant kind of you know\ngetting ready to have this this child\ncome into your life knowing this kind of\nhistory that you've carried you know\ninto this experience and also these\nmoments early on which which weren't as\njoyous as I think so many of us\nanticipate Parenthood to be were\nactually quite difficult\noh yes so difficult I\nwhen that started happening with the\nbreastfeeding that\nreally\nwas devastating for me\num\nI feel\nI felt like\nyou know I had done so much work and\nthat he was just like following me\nand that he was never gonna go away\nand that was really hard\nsorry no no I mean thank you for\nallowing your emotions to to be so\npresent here and like I said I have the\nidea that a lot of listeners are going\nto be greatly impacted and maybe their\nyou know Journeys are going to be unique\nto them but I do think\num these are moments where you know\nwe're with a child we are you know\ntrying to be that cycle breaker and and\nhere comes right this past is not only a\nreminder of what happened to us but you\nknow I'm sure full of in a lot of ways\nfear and like well what happens now and\nyou know how do I provide this nutrient\nor what happens now logistically\num you know in terms of feeding my child\nto what happens emotionally you know\nbecause then it gets it does get\ncomplicated now you have this little\nbeing with all of this hope and you know\ndesire to carry all these beautiful\nthings you've been doing for your own\nhealing and your own inner child into\nthis relationship and it it does and it\ncan feel like quicksand like well wait a\nminute now I'm I don't have that\ntraction\num that I once had and again I just want\nto thank you for allowing the emotion of\nit to come forward because I've spoken\nand worked with a lot of you know\nparents mothers in particular who carry\nso much shame for admitting these these\nmoments where their past does come to\nwash them in the present in these you\nknow again moments of what's supposed to\nbe or anticipated to be something\nemotionally completely different than\nwhat's actually happening and I think\nit's more humans like yourself that are\nbeing honest in these ways that are you\nknow going to relieve the shame that so\nmany carry when these moments are part\nof the reality much like when we enter\ninto romantic Partnerships like I was\nkind of sharing earlier and we reach new\nlevels of healing I mean when we have a\nchild I mean talk about our own inner\nchild and us going right back to\nChildhood and having not only more\nconsistently those older patterns at the\nready but these really acute moments of\noverwhelming emotion\nand I think too that's why it's so\nimportant we've gotten into a society to\nwith the whole breastfeeding thing and\nwhen that happened to me\nI\nI think it's so important not to judge\nhow people do things and you have no\nidea what might be going on for them I\ntried to push through it with her\num and just kind of said to myself okay\nyou could deal with whatever's going on\nyou can still breastfeed her but I saw\nher getting anxious like you know she\nwas an infant and I could feel her\nfeeling my anxiousness and for that in\nthat moment\nher being so little\nit was really incredible to me I'm like\nwow this little being can feel already\nshe can't even talk she can't you know\nthere's a million things she can't do\nshe can't survive on her own but she can\nfeel my my anxiousness and so I just\nstopped breastfeeding all together and I\nstarted pumping and that's how you know\nI wanted to continue to give her breast\nmilk and that was for both of us the\nemotionally the safest way that we could\ndo it\nand again I want to just commend you\nbecause that is quite a difficult\ndecision especially with all of the\ninformation that you know we get around\nthese particular parenting decisions and\nwhat we need to do and you know to speak\nto your point I mean children just like\nyou are at some time we are feeling\nbeings we are so attuned\num oftentimes more so than the adults\naround us because they've become so\ndisconnected and squashed that intuition\nyou know for all the conditioned reasons\num though children are that pure state\nof awareness and again making that\nchoice to acknowledge that I might wish\nthis was wasn't the case I might be\narmed with all the information of why I\nneed to you know make this choice you\nknow such that as a breastfeeding though\nthe radical honesty quite literally that\nyou've had to have with yourself to say\nyou know what my body is sending the\nopposite signal that I want my body to\nbe sending in that moment that then my\nchild needs in that moment which is\nSafety and Security so that they can\neven process the nutrients that your you\nknow body is giving them and really\nhaving that moment of Reckoning where\nyou know we do look and it's of no fault\nof your own of no ill intention you were\nhonoring your body that was carrying\nthat wisdom that was saying you know\nthis doesn't feel safe for me right now\nit has nothing to do with the child at\nall though it allowed you to live into I\nthink that most aligned Choice um which\nfor societal reasons for conditioning\nreasons you know because we're holding\nourselves up to an expectation so few of\nus I think and I think more and more\npeople are beginning to honor and what\ntheir body is saying armed with now the\ninformation that you know those signals\nthat stress that you felt you know\nevidenced and felt and saw maybe in your\nchild's body is impacting the child and\nso being I think brutally honest allowed\nyou to make the choice that created then\nthat safe container of experience even\nif that was through the bottle not what\nyou intended intended or hoped\num yeah to be through and I think again\nthat's just such a testament to attuned\nparenting to really being present to\nkind of what we are where we are how we\nare how we're feeling and knowing that\nthose are going to be communicated those\nstates of stress of overwhelm of\ndisconnection even if we wish it weren't\nthe case\num if it's still stored in our bodies it\nis the case so as you know past this\num period of time where she was you know\nso little so dependent\num kind of what else have you seen in\nterms of your parenting Journey\num acknowledging that again you have\nyour own inner child right that you're\ncontinuing to show up in service of and\nnow you have a developing I think you\nsaid she's eight years old now\num were there any other I guess moments\nor periods in terms of parenting in and\nof itself where\num you that you found particularly\nchallenging based on again your own your\nown history your own past\nI think the biggest thing that I try to\ndo with her and I say this quote in the\nbook\nand I say it when I in my when I'm young\nwhich is the truth feels so good why\ndon't we say it more and it it's such a\nsimple thing but it's so true\nand I've learned that with her because\nshe's an amazing being and she's just\nthis honest wants to know all the things\nand I've just really tried to do the\nexact opposite of what I was\nI I don't even want to say taught\nbecause I think I just learned from\nwatching of what how things were\nsupposed to be or you know what my life\nlooked like at that time\num\nso we just have a policy in this house\nwhere we always tell the truth and as\nlong as we tell the truth we never get\nin trouble and we have a open and honest\nand loving relationship and I think the\nbiggest lesson for me with her\nespecially when it came to my family was\nhaving her understand that just because\nyou're an adult does not mean that you\nare a healthy adult does not mean that\nyou're doing the right thing does not\nmean that what you say is Right does not\nmean the way you're treating a child is\nright I think that that's been my\nbiggest lesson with her because I was\ntaught well this is we respect our\nelders this is just what we do and it\ndoesn't matter what they're doing to you\nor how they're treating you this is what\nyou do and so I've done the opposite\nwith her where I say to her just because\nit's your Aunt or just because it's an\nadult doesn't mean they're making good\nchoices and doesn't mean they're making\nthe right decision\nand when were her as a child if we don't\nwork through it and deal with it it\ncomes out in our adult life and\nunfortunately it comes out on other\npeople and that's why mommy surrounds\nyou with people that don't do those\nthings\nwhen she asks questions because\nobviously her her cousins were in her\nlife for a long time so she's had a lot\nof confusion around okay why all of a\nsudden is this they're not in my life\nand I miss them and I love them as do I\nbut I try to help her understand that\nyou know it's such a cliche thing to say\nbut her people hurt people and it's just\ntrue and if you are not doing the work\nand you're not healing yourself it is\nultimately going to bleed out in every\naspect of your life\nand that's just the reality of it so\nthat's kind of our Mantra in the home\nI'm just so inspired uh Kimberly from\nthe the honesty to again the reality\nthat so much is I think in terms of\nthese conditioned beliefs where whether\nit's cultural or based on again a\ncertain age I do think we've taught\nchildren to defer right to the world\naround us to the adults around us to the\nmedia around us right to what the people\nof the block are doing or think we\nshould be doing around us or even our\nteachers what they're saying that we\nshould be doing um and I you know those\nthose moments of wisdom where you're not\nonly communicating that um to your child\nor you're living you know into that into\nyour own honest truth into you know\nspeaking so directly and candidly about\nyour own healing and pain and the\npatterns as they continue to affect you\nas I always say until we become\nconscious of you know what is creating\nthe decisions and the habits and\npatterns that are driving our daily life\nwe can't make those changes even if we\nvery much want to showing up in service\nof breaking these patterns and teaching\nour future your Generations differently\nreally comes in in action in these\nmoments where you're being honest in\nthese moments where you're you know\nteaching through lived experience of you\nknow honoring your child when they come\nand she comes to you with whatever is\nhappening and not just telling her to\nsquashed squash that intuition herself\nand as we get ready to end here I want\nto kind of affirm and attest to you you\nwrite a question or Muse a question in\nin your book probably on around the time\nwhen just for finding out you're getting\npregnant and or we're very newly into\nmotherhood and you kind of acknowledge\nwhat your real fear is and your real\nfear you want to say is what if I do\nnothing what if nothing I do will be\nenough to protect this child what if the\ncurse of is it Earl Earl Avenue follows\nmy baby too and I want to hear affirm\nyou that I mean you are doing what you\nneed to do to protect your child and\nit's not necessarily as I think so many\nof us think right while you are shifting\nand changing Dynamics and put putting up\nboundaries what you're doing at least in\nmy language is you're teaching your\nchild resilience to trust herself her\ninstincts how she can begin to then\nspeak her truth not only to you her you\nknow safe protected secure caregiving\nspace now though over time she will have\nthat resilience to affirm herself and to\nknow when it is that she needs to make\ndifferent choices to protect herself so\nI want to honor everything you've done\nin your own healing Journey all of the\nways that that will in my opinion\ngreatly impact your child and now the\ngift that you've given not only\nlisteners of of this channel here though\nreally the whole Global collective in\nputting out your new book which I'm just\nholding up for anyone who is viewing\nthis um glimmer\num really like I said when we began this\ntalk I'm just so inspired by Your Story\nby your journey by how much you share of\nit between these pages\nand I know that other survival survivors\nlike yourself who get their hands on\nthis book not only will they if you feel\nless alone I imagine they'll come away\nfeeling inspired with hope that they too\ncan begin to break if they have that\nsame fear you know am I going to just\nkeep these Cycles going you really do\nsend a resounding\num hope and possibility to all of us\nthat no you don't have to you can show\nup in different ways by making new\nchoices by having hard conversations by\nlearning and teaching them skills and\nmodeling new ways of being and quite\nliterally in my opinion you can not only\nchange our future Generations but create\nyou know and and impact humans to change\nin my opinion the world around it around\nus so thank you thank you thank you\nagain for pouring yourself into this\nwork for pouring this work out into the\nworld and for taking the time to have a\nchat with me today about all of it thank\nyou so much for having me I really\nappreciate it"
