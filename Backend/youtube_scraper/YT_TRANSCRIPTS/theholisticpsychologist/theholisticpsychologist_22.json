    "transcript": "with so much information out there about\nrelationships we're also now hearing a\nlot more about our needs this is a good\nthing because the more we understand\nwhat our needs are and how to get them\nmet the better we'll feel so today I'm\ngoing to talk about our basic emotional\nneeds and how we can get them met so\nfirst what are emotional needs just like\nwe have basic needs for survival meaning\nfood shelter\nwater we also have emotional needs that\nhelp us Thrive as human beings now of\ncourse we can survive without our\nemotional needs being fully met but when\nour emotional needs aren't met we can\nactually become physically mentally and\nemotionally unwell which is why it is so\nimportant to understand what our needs\nactually are because in reality so many\nof us are so disconnected from our needs\nwe weren't taught how to meet them or\nwhen we had needs in childhood some of\nus were shamed for having them so much\nof our healing is about getting back in\ntouch with our emotional needs when our\nemotional needs are met we're actually\nable to feel calmer more peaceful and\nwe're able to Simply Be\nourselves when our needs are not met we\nend up feeling hurt frustrated and\nresentful so now let's explore our seven\ncore emotional needs our first core\nemotional need is a need of belonging\nbelonging comes from knowing that we\nhave a purpose or a meaning in our life\nmeaning can come from having a\nconnection to our family to building a\nbusiness or a career to Simply Having a\nsupportive Community when we have\nmeaning and at the same time we feel\nconnected we feel we belong now of\ncourse there are so many different ways\nthat we can feel we belong But\nultimately when we feel supported in\nbeing who we are and when we're aware of\nwho we are we feel belonged our second\nemotional need is for safety safety\ncomes from Simply being in an\nenvironment where we can put down our\ndefenses where we can be relaxed and\nwhere simply we can be our authentic\nself it's a space where we don't feel\nlike we're being controlled where we\ndon't feel like we're being harshly\njudged when we feel safe in our body our\nbody's nervous system is able to go into\na parasympathetic State actually helping\nus connect to ourselves and the people\nand the world around us our third core\nemotional need is for\ndecompression today we live in a\nfast-paced always connected World\nlifestyle which can be a lot for our\nnervous system decompression is simply\nhaving privacy time space to just be\nquiet or to just be in solitude be in\nour own presence some of you might even\nfind yourself hiding in your car or\nmaybe in your bathroom just a couple\nmoments when you can have a second to\nregroup it is so important to begin to\nintentionally carve out time for those\nmoments to decom press especially if\nwe're sensitive to over stimulation or\nif we feel drained as a lot of do when\nwe're around a lot of people for a long\namount of time it is so helpful to begin\nto explore for yourself how you feel\nwhen you're around others and how much\ntime and space you need alone to\ndecompress to regroup to find your\nCenter again our fourth core emotional\nneed is for autonomy the easiest way to\nthink of autonomy is having a say in our\nown lives we get to choose our values we\nget to choose how we exist in the world\nI'm sure a lot of you can maybe even\nright now think of a time when you\ndidn't have autonomy where maybe you\nfelt pressured or maybe you felt\ncontrolled by another person you can\nprobably feel now how bad that\nfeels humans need the time and space to\nmake their own choices and their own\ndecisions or to be\nautonomous our fifth core emotional need\nis for\nintimacy we are at our our core social\ncreatures and our connections to other\npeople is one of the most important\nneeds that we share as human\nbeings emotional intimacy means having\nsomeone else that's attuned to us that's\ninterested in how we think and how we\nfeel and that values their connection or\ntheir relationship with us you can\nprobably even right now think back to a\nrelationship where you felt at peace\nwhere you felt safe and accepted for\nbeing who you are you felt safe and\nsecure in that relationship so probably\nyou wanted to spend a lot of time with\nthat person the opposite is also true\nwhen we don't feel that sense of\nemotional intimacy that sense of being\nknown by someone else we end up feeling\nlonely isolated and sometimes even\ndepressed our sixth core emotional need\nis for Challenge and growth we actually\ngrow through challenges or through\nstress anytime we're in a situation\nthat's outside of our comfort zone we're\nlearning about who we are about what we\nwant about how to solve problems this is\nwhy we need challenge in our life and we\nneed something to work towards when we\nhave something that we're working\ntowards we give ourselves an opportunity\nto solve problems that happen along the\nway to create new opportunities and\nultimately again to learn not only about\nourselves but to learn how to trust\nourselves all of these things bring us\nconfidence and end up helping us grow as\nhuman\nbeings the seventh core emotional need\nis for self connection just as we have a\ndeep need to be connected to other\npeople we also have a deep need to be\nconnected to ourselves a major part of\nthis self-connection is having\nselfawareness being witnessed seeing\nclearly our own behaviors learning how\nto also witness our thoughts and our\nemot\nreactions this includes our ability to\nself sooth or to calm oursel after\nstressful situations a lot of us end up\nseeking comfort from other people which\nis equally important but also important\nto make sure that if and when someone\nisn't available we have the tools to\ncalm ourselves we have the practices to\nbring ourselves back into a calm\nregulated State I want you all to begin\nnow to take some time begin to reflect\non your own needs in each of these areas\nyou might notice that in some of these\nareas your needs are fully met and maybe\nin other areas your needs aren't yet met\nat all and that's okay that's a very\nnatural part of Human\nRelationships stay tuned next time I'm\ngoing to talk a little more about\npractices that you can begin now to help\nbetter meet your core emotional needs\nand as always I'd love to hear from you\nin the comments do you feel like your\ncore emotional needs are being met and\nif not leave it in the comments the ones\nthat aren't"
