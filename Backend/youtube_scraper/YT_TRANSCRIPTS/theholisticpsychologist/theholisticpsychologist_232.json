    "transcript": "today i'm here with author carmen rita\nwong to discuss her new book which\nlaunches just this week why didn't you\ntell me\ncarmen is a writer and non-profit board\nleader whose board positions include the\nmoth and planned parenthood of america\nshe was the co-creator and television\nhost of on the money on cnbc and was a\nnational columnist for glamour latina\nmen's health and good housekeeping\nwong is the author of a series of novels\nand two best-selling advice books\nshe is the founder and ceo of malecon\nproductions where she develops\nfemale-focused media and entertainment\nshe currently lives in manhattan with\nher daughter i'm super excited for this\nchat here today\nso thank you carmen i'm super excited\nfor you to be joining me here today for\na chat when elena reached out to me and\ngave me a little bit of a blurb um\nyelena of course working for the\npublisher\nwhen she gave me a little bit of blurb\nabout what your book was about um i knew\nthat i was very interested in hearing\nmore about your story and since the book\narrived to my inbox i quite literally\ndidn't put it down until i finished it\nso now i'm super excited to meet you and\nand to dive into your new book why\ndidn't you tell me so thank you for\njoining me here today\nthank you so much for having me you know\ni'm a huge fan you're so fantastic i i'm\nsuch a huge fan\nand um every time you post\ni have a scenario\nin my life that it applies to\nso where's simpatico\ni'm not surprised to hear i'm honored to\nhear um and i saw so much of um like we\nwere chatting a bit before we hit record\nhere today so much of i think the way i\nthink about life and\nour families and our struggles you\nreally illustrated all of it um so when\nyou're saying i'm reading the post and\ni'm kind of pinging it your memoir did\nsuch a really beautiful job at kind of\nsharing the human journey illustrating a\nlot of again the struggles the concepts\nthat i talk about day in and day out so\nbefore we kind of dive into what's\nbetween the pages of this memoir i know\nyou wrote previous books i believe if\ni'm correct on on finances i think so\ntalk to me about um why a memoir why now\nand how did that come to be kind of what\nmade the decision for you to put your\nlife story down on these pages\nyeah i had i had a long history um in\nmedia covering uh finance so from a tv\nshow to magazine editor advice columnist\nand then a faculty professor i've i've\ndone it all but i've always wanted to\nwrite a memoir\num\nbecause i i want those people that i\ndidn't see myself or anyone who looked\nlike me\nyou know growing up in in certain places\nthat i had to live and in the\nprofessional spaces i was in and i was a\nhuge\nyou know book fan i mean i libraries\nsaved me saved me so much\nso\ni said you know\nmy story is actually an incredibly\namerican\nstory because people say to me they say\noh you're latina you're chinese you're\nyou're this you're that and this is such\nan american story and i felt like\nif i told it then other people could\ntell their story too and we could see\nhow\ndifferent yet\ntogether we are in so many ways and the\nother thing nicole you know this about\npeople and\ntheir psychology sometimes you just have\na compulsion you have not a compulsion\nyou have a\nuh to use a pregnant with it like you're\njust like it's in you and it has to\nhappen and it has to come out\num and then years went by and then about\nfive years ago i was like that's it this\nis what i'm doing\ni'm focusing on it thank goodness i was\nin a position to be able to do that and\ni wanted to leave it as a legacy to my\ndaughter but um\na lot of things happened in life and of\ncourse the pandemic which made it go\nfaster because life is so precious and\nwe're not getting any younger so\nthe privilege the privilege of aging is\nhappening so i wanted to make sure to\nget it down\nwell or the collective i can speak for\nthem a bit here um is very appreciative\nand i'm so inspired to see people like\nyourself really stepping into like\nyou're saying it just my story needed to\nbe told and my hope was that people\nwould would hear the resonance or the\nsimilarity in it and um very much\nemblematic and descriptive of my own\njourney where um you know i think that\nthere's a lot about my story that does\nkind of ping the similar no matter where\nyou're living um of course we're located\nhere in the states but regardless of\nwhere in the world you are i think the\nthe overwhelming initial response that i\nget at god as i myself started sharing\nmy part of my story that i of course\nthought i was so different around was\nhow similar your very beautifully made\npoint um i think that we ultimately all\nare so what was it like then i guess as\nyou began to sit down and write the\nprocess of i guess putting your your\nstory down in paper was it a comfortable\nkind of natural process because it had\nbeen so alive in thought for you or was\ni guess there anything surprising that\nit came up for you as you journey\nthrough then putting the paper pen to\npaper\nyeah i mean i've always been a writer\nsince i was a kid i've always i've\nalways written but i um and maybe we'll\nget into it i could not keep a diary so\ni very much kept a diary in my head\nand it was i made sure remember things\nto replay things to connect things in my\nhead\nbut what happened in the past several\nyears is um\nwell 15 years of weekly therapy nicole\nwhich is a a big privilege to say but i\nreally\nthat was such a change when you click\nwith someone when you connect with\nsomeone when you do the work as he would\nsay to me yeah but you did the work\npeople can just show up and take the\nappointment\nyou have to work at it and what that's\nwhat i did is i just constantly and\nconsistently was like i'm going to get\nat the bottom of this i'm going\nto figure this out kind of like crack\nthe mystery of my life and my mother's\nlife and how we all ended up here and\nsee her as\na separate person with her as not just\nmy parent but a separate human being\nwith her own past her own trauma her own\nwants and needs because when we have a\ndifficult relationship with a parent\nwe can't really see past it right\nshe had passed away many years ago but i\nwas like i needed to see past that so i\ndid a lot of work to do that and once i\ndid that like the connections\nnicole they flowed yeah they they really\njust everything kind of fit together\nvery well\nyeah so symbolic of i think coming in\ninto that alignment really does then\ntranslate into the connections the ease\ni think outward and i love actually kind\nof starting here because i noted some\nquotes i think i shared with you when we\ngot started i'm such a big quote person\nand um i think this this quote right\nhere so you say funny the things we\ndon't want to see once we're grown even\nthe facts in our hands or we don't see\nbecause we have zero curiosity to\nexplore things further because we trust\nthe word of others\nones we're supposed to be able to trust\nand i think this is a great place to\njump off because i think what you're\ndescribing in these lines is\nthe process or the way my brain\ntranslates is the process of becoming\nconscious like you're saying becoming\nconscious to this separate being that is\nmy mother and ultimately the\nrelationship and your you know carmen's\nexperience of that relationship and i\nthink a lot of us do have those blinders\non for many many different reasons that\nmake it difficult and the time at which\nwe come to consciousness about all these\ndifferent things happens at a different\npart of our life though as far as i'm\nconcerned that's where we begin the\njourney of of creating change so um can\nyou say a little bit more about kind of\nhow it was for you the things that you\nknow when you came to the awareness i\nguess that you weren't seeing some sort\nof things in your own life\nyeah well your subconscious really picks\nup on things right your whole life and\nit my subconscious i was always one of\nthose you know when you're raised in\ntrauma you're a hyper aware person yes\nalways little hyper aware not so much\naware of myself however or my own\nfeelings or my gut not really listening\nto that um but as i got older it kind of\nstarted to build\nand then those feelings of there's\nsomething\nwrong there's something different\nthere's some things people aren't\ntelling me\nwe all want to trust our parents\nnobody wants to\nthink about their parents\ni even hate to say it all out be liars\nright or making up stories nobody wants\nto think that it's very very hurtful\nbecause why would they do such a thing\nto you but i had to go there\nand then it was presented to me like it\njust all kind of came at me but to your\npoint about consciousness\nyou know as i did that as i listened to\nthat voice more and as i put these\nthings together\nlet me tell you you just see things so\nmuch more clearly and with a lot less\npain\nit's not that it's not painful\nit's that it doesn't become the top note\nit's like understanding\nthat as that person as a person\num you know and i was just very tired of\nliving in anger\nand call anger is\nvicious i mean when i first found out\nthe\nthe secret um\nyou know i drank too much i partied too\nmuch i was angry all the time\nand i really had to deal with that\nand dealing with that was an enormous\ndifficult thing to do but i did because\ni it was scary\nand it's not fun to live with\ni'm sorry and that's what you're\ndescribing i think carmen is such a\nbeautiful representation of of how\nadaptive we are we grow up in\nenvironments with circumstances and all\nof this you know unconsciously is is\nregistering is impacting us and to speak\nto your point you know when we are in\nthat state of dependency we need some\nversion of a connected caregiver to show\nup for us right and we do then confuse\ntrust and love and the dynamics of that\nrelationship for our reality because\nthat's all it is it becomes the reality\nthat we're living in and\nall the while behind the scenes\nunderneath piling up our you know\nemotions and adaptations and maybe\nself-harming or other harming patterns\nthat we are coping with everything that\nis still below the surface but some of\nus that get so good at distracting\nourselves that living in those adaptive\npatterns that we\ndo feel you know somewhat blindsided or\nlife does meet us with an opportunity\nnot to look away this one time and then\nwe have to i think kind of settle into\nwhat is is so and and from that place\ncan you tell me a little bit more about\nwhat you said when you talked about it\nbeing painful but but not as as painful\nwhat was that shift can you kind of\nverbalize what that was for you\noh gosh um\ni think it was spending the time and the\nattention to really\nseeing\nhow should i say this it's like\nyou once you do see your parents as\nseparate people\num which i'm sure takes time and\nmaturity and work and and all that you\nyou can't help but let go of some of\nthat anger\nbecause they're human beings like\nyourself\nand who hasn't done stupid horrible\nthings also too you know my parents were\nof a different generation where\nyou know we do tend to be products of\nour generation\nand and our the generational trauma\nthat's handed down we can make a choice\nto make things different but\ni would say that you know becoming very\naware\nof who she was what she went through and\nsitting\nin her pain\nright and a big part of that was was\nwriting down and examining what her life\nhad been like what was it like to move\nfrom a very close dominican family in\nharlem\nto\nnew hampshire which was like another\nplanet\nfor her back then\nno family none of the food she loves not\nthe music she loved other people nothing\ncompletely isolated and she was such a\nsmart\nspunky woman and\nyou know i could put myself in that\nand i was like my god like\nit's terrible did she deal with it the\nright way it knew\nno\nbut i understand it\ni don't know however yet which we will\nget to um\ni'm still grappling\nwith some not so great feelings\nabout on the on the other parent side\ni'm still grappling\ni think that's going to take time\nsometimes\nit takes time oh of course of course i\nthink you're describing the process um\nthis isn't a light bulb right we don't\nread a book about you know generational\nor intergenerational\nyou know habits and patterns or like\nyou're saying cultures and kind of just\nembody then that as our truth it is the\nprocess of shifting from right my parent\nas i think what you're describing really\nbeautifully is my parent as human\nseparate from my parent as their\nbehaviors as their actions in\nrelationship with me and then therefore\nhow all of that impacted me and what i'm\ncarrying with me right if we can create\njust a little bit of separation that\nthat is a human\nthat was acting in ways doesn't minimize\nthe deep pain the deep hurt the trauma\nthat you know some of us are carrying\nwith us though it does create a bit of\nthat separation and i think that's an\nincredibly important part of our own\nhealing journey too where we separate\nourselves right from our own actions\nbecause a lot of us might even have in\nour wake a lot of against self other\nharming you know consequences that we've\nthen merged with we've now become\nthe bad person who does bad things and\nhealing can i think begin when we just\nput a little bit of space in there in a\ncompassionate way that we are a human\nwho for many different reasons again\nbased in typically our and then\ntherefore our parents past experiences\nwith their own caregivers\ndo act in ways that can be painful\nhowever again it doesn't have to be who\nwe are at our core\nexactly this is something i'm trying to\nteach my daughter she's 15 years old and\nit's really hard as you know at that age\nin adolescence and you know you're\nreally\nyou internalize a lot and if you do bad\nthings you think you're a bad person and\neverything's black or white everything's\nbad and good and\nit takes some training out of that\nballistic if i can give this to her as a\ngift for the rest of her life\nearly\nwhereas it took me\ndecades\nlike that then\nyou know i'm very very pleased i you\nknow to have at least partially uh\nstopped that cycle\nwhat what a what a great gift too and i\nalso want to honor um you're you're\nright in i think the very important\ndevelopmental age because they're\nactually before age seven eight um the\nway our brains are are structured and\ndeveloped\nas a little developing human we can't\nunderstand the maturity or the\ncomplexity\nof this conversation we are very black\nand white you know bad things happen\nbecause bad people\nyou know do bad things and so children\ndon't have the ability in their actual\nbrain to see\nthis separation or this distinction\nuntil again they're in adolescence and\ninto their teenage years so anyone\nlistening to this\nthat has little ones out there you know\nreally honoring that it is really\ndifficult for a toddler to create that\nseparation when they are reprimanded\ntheir mind does make sense of it that\nthey've gotten in trouble because they\nare a bad child and again the more\nconsistently than that happens some of\nus age into adulthood\nwith that deep root of belief that we\nare our bad at our core so the gift\nyou're giving\nyour daughter in our teenage years is is\nreally foundational because chances are\nif she's human like the rest of us there\nmight be unsavory things that she\nchooses to do you know or reacts\ninto into the future though creating\nthat separation really is that shame\nspiral that i think many of us can get\nstuck in\nor\nright the ability to to show up\ndifferently in the next moment\ni want to go into another another\nquote um another piece that you wrote in\nthere as we're kind of diving into now\nrelationships and how impactful because\nwhen we're talking about the\nsubconscious a lot of what we're talking\nabout is all that we learned in our\nrelationships with others from our\nbeliefs to our\nown ability to navigate our own emotions\nto our own ability to navigate our own\nrelationships and if you listen to my\nwork a lot um you'll hear me often\nlocate that right in those early\nrelationships so\nyou speak of\nyour mom\nand you go you say you begin by saying i\nbecame terrified of her though i loved\nher and needed her so as we do our\nmothers when lupe was sad she could turn\nangry in an instant the mom who sat by\nmy bedside all night when i had\nnighttime terrors was now the one\nstanding over me as i sat on my bed\nscreaming that i was ungrateful and so\nmany other things that it all turned\ninto a jumble of sharp words i couldn't\nhear but could only file away into boxes\nin my mind close the lids push to the\nback and seal shut i filled the bot i\nfiled the boxes of fear and pain in my\nmind but the tremors they made within\ntheir combines escaped in the form of\nconstant anxiety and self harm\nagain just\nthe picture that you painted in that and\nthe resonance that i feel in terms of\nthis this deep rooted you know visceral\nfeelings of whether it's anxiety anger\nsadness again all imprinted and living\nbiologically physiologically within us\nagain all often a byproduct of those\nthose very very very early relationships\nthat we're not even conscious of until\nwe begin to i think look and experience\nthem in this new way\nand this is something you talk about uh\na lot about you know um\nwhen you you put those things away they\nwill\nsurface right and they will surface in\nbehaviors it will surface in choices\nthat you make sometimes not very good\nchoices and one of the things is you\nknow as i was writing this like i was\nreally thinking it helped me\nto think that of that filing of boxes\nright of putting those boxes away and\nhow they kind of\nif you like let's say you're a hoarder\nand you only have so much space right\nyou feel and they all start falling on\nyou it's like those are the really\nhorrible parts of your life where you're\njust over the top because you have to\nface\neverything that you've packed away\ni was i was trying to survive\nand this is one thing that i've done too\nwith this book is i've\ni used to feel incredibly guilty for a\nlot of the decisions that i've made\ni felt bad that i've had a couple bad\nmarriages i felt shame\nbecause of some things drinking too much\nor doing this too much that too much and\ni realized like i was a kid\ntrying to survive and parenting myself\nand my siblings and my parents\ni did the best that i could it's kind of\namazing\nthat i didn't completely destruct you\nknow so\nfiling those things away it's been years\nof unpacking but i can tell you\nthe relief the weight\nand the veil that's in front of you that\nyou you kind of see through this that\nmakes you do bad see people in different\nways and and ways that you shouldn't and\naccept people in your life you shouldn't\nwhen all of this kind of is cleared\nit's amazing\nlike i feel um i had a period of where i\ni describe it as you know when you're\nyou have a little spinny thing on your\ncomputer\nlike rebooting like i'm like doing a\nhardware upgrade this is not just\nsoftware it's like a hardware upgrade of\nlike rebooting so i i felt a little\nunstable or a little kind of to myself\nand a little\ninward but i also felt like i was\nfloating\nand it became a very physical sensation\nand um\ni just see so much more clearly\nbecause now i know why it's like oh why\nam i feeling myself attracted to that\nperson hey one second one second\nthat sort of thing hold up you know what\nwhere is that coming from\num\nit's kind it's it's kind of tremendous\nand that really helped me write this\nbook for sure well i think what you're\nvery beautifully carmen describing is um\nhealing you know and and i really\nsimplify healing as i often simplify\nthings into two main steps um and the\nfirst step is what i call the awareness\npiece right the coming to consciousness\nthe seeing\nthe things as they are the habits the\npatterns so like you're beautifully\ndescribing yeah i've done a lot of\nthings as a as a coping mechanism from\nthis very\nearly overwhelming environment where i\nwas given where i needed to assume\nresponsibilities that were completely\nyou know above my maturity level yet as\nwe all do we adapted and you did just\nthat and the byproduct of that you know\nwell into your adult years are all of\nthese behaviors that don't serve me for\na lot of us that in and of itself is is\nthe healing because we might have been\ncarrying shame or again harboring that\ndeep belief that you know what all of\nthis wasn't because i'm adapted to an\nenvironment because i'm that bad\nterrible human it's not worthy that i\nthought i was so for some of us having\nthat relief of saying no there's an\nexplanation there's a reason things make\nsense now\nthat could be the healing in and of\nitself so for the large majority of us\nthere might be that step two which is\nnow i now that i see this\ni want to begin to show up differently\nin some way so like you're saying now\nthat i feel this initial ping of\nattraction or this excitement or i feel\ncompelled to say or do this thing i can\ngive myself just that one moment to say\nhold on pause\nis this really what you want to say do\nact on\nnow or\ndo you want to make a new\nchoice because as far as i'm concerned\nif we're talking about change\nmost of the time we're talking about a\nnew a new choice so simplifying right\nhealing is can i become conscious of all\nof the ways that i am being honoring\ncompassionately that most of them\nprobably are an adaptation\nand can i create new space to change to\nchange the way i show up to show up in a\nway that might serve me and my\nenvironment differently it feels like\nmoving from reaction to action 100 yeah\nand that's what i that's kind of what i\nput in my head just remember not don't\nreact act and that's that simple\ndifference is the extra one second\nright that you need to kind of put\nyourself strongly firmly where you're\nstanding\nand really make a decision as opposed to\ndo what has been taught to you or what\nyou've turned into a habit\num because of\nwhat you had to go through when you were\nyoung yeah that that is the trans\ntransformational pivotal moment as far\nas i'm concerned it's can you locate\nyourself\nright here right now not in the past\nright not in the bedroom or in that\nearly adult or that young adult home\nwith the siblings around doing what you\nhave to do\ncan you show up here you know as the\nadult however many years later with new\noptions new choices new resources and\ncan you stand actually in that space\nbecause it's crazy how our mind works i\nmean we could be physically present in\nour adult body and as if we're that\nthree-year-old right inside that early\nhome reacting in that same which is why\ni mean if and i'll speak from my own\nlived experience which is why i know i\nlook a bit childish when i'm in that you\nknow reactive place i do stomp around\nlike a three-year-old or i do\ni'm not gonna talk to you and it's as if\nwe're literally frozen in time so all of\nthese resources all of this adult\nmaturity in this grounded sense isn't\npresent because i might as well be\nin that early adult home when the only\noption was to scream and yell or to take\nmy toys and run away\nyeah and in in doing the books like i\nhad to look back and look at those\ndecisions i made and the way i reacted\nto people and trust me a lot of stuff\ndidn't make it in there but the really\ngood stuff is in there and i'm just like\ni'm remembering things i'm going oh my\ngod i did what like why would i do such\na thing and oh that was over the top\nthat was ridiculous it was like because\ni wasn't angry at him i was angry at my\nmother i wasn't angry you know i didn't\nknow how to process my own pain or\nrejection or this that the other thing\nand so i acted a certain way\nit's very interesting and you kind of\nlearn and you go oh yeah no i don't want\nto do that anymore yeah yeah\nanymore 100 and talking about pain so\nanother quote um that i wanted to\nhighlight because i think this speaks to\nme\ni know in a lot of ways you say you show\nthat lupe's lack of boundaries created\nwalls in me no one would or could know\nall of what i'm thinking or planning my\nmotives and desires\nmaybe\never um and i'm kind of honoring here\nthe the group of us that you know maybe\noutwardly\nyou know we're not\nreactive or screaming or yelling or\nmaybe even making a presence at all\nmaybe we're not even connecting to other\npeople again because we have what you're\ndescribing as as walls um which again as\nfar as i'm concerned are a byproduct of\nlike you're describing those early\nexperiences with with your mom in in\nparticular so can you say a little more\nabout kind of how you discovered these\nwalls um within yourself and\nwell\nwhen you have a parent and it's really\nfunny somebody pointed out to me the\nother day it's like you know i think it\nwas a review of the book was like you\nknow lupe was\nwouldn't\nlet carmen have a moment of privacy\nright right but she was the one with all\nthe secrets\nand it's that form of projection right\nit's that whole like um whatever they're\naccusing you of\nthey have it that sort of thing you know\nthat was exactly it and so she i mean\nshe did that's awful she went through my\ndrawers every day when i went to school\nshe went through my closet she would go\nthrough absolutely everything\ni couldn't keep a diary that's why i was\nwriting in my head constantly um\nand anything i wanted to try to hide if\nshe were to find it i had to make up\nsome big story about it\nwhat you do is as a kid of course when\nyou have a parent like that is you learn\nto build walls and you learn to lie lie\num and that is as you know lying creates\na big distance between you\nand the person and the people that you\nlove when you lie so those walls were\nbuilt\nby her and me\num so it was a huge gulf between us\nalways\num even though i liked it you know i\ntalked to my mother's ghosts you know\nnow now and then um that we have a much\nbetter relationship by the way\nvery one-sided but um\nyou know making peace with that and\nseeing that it was because she was\nreacting to herself\nand the secret she was keeping the pain\nthat she had and she only did it to me\nshe didn't do it to my siblings\nso that was interesting\nand so and i think what you're\ndescribing here is\nso many of us i mean those of us who\ngrew up with siblings while we shared\nthe same relationship someone an\nenvironment or home at least\nwe could have drastically different\nexperiences because of the actual\ndynamics\nbetween you know ourself and the\ndifferent caregivers around us and then\nour siblings and i think to speak to\nyour point um and i have a very unique\nsituation too and i have two older\nsiblings who are 15 and 18 years older\nthan me so\nas far as my experience has been it\nmight as well have been that i was\nraised in a different family entirely\nthan\nmy younger siblings yeah then the two of\nthem and i know with your yeah you have\nthat kind of bit of a span and it's it's\nreally crazy to hear kind of the way\nthey conceptualize and describe my\nparents and the childhood that they had\nand how different\nthat is for me but i think what you're\ngetting to in terms of lying you're\nreally highlighting the importance of\nour truth whatever it is our thoughts\nour feelings our experiences and\nallowing them to be what we're bringing\ninto our relationship and for me um for\ndifferent reasons having built my own\nwalls and childhood being very\ndisconnected emotionally from my family\nnever seeking to quote unquote worry\nthem and increase the already overly\nstressed home i became very secretive i\nwould hide things and i had a family\nmuch unlike um lupe who let me who i had\na bedroom they never even came in as far\nas i i knew i was able to hide things i\nhad a whole\nsecret\nlife\naway from them and that is another form\nof a wall um into my adult years before\nmy mom my mom passed i know she didn't\nknow me there's a lot of things that she\nwould reference of not really knowing or\nbeing surprised by aspects of me that\nshe would discover in my adulthood and\nagain why is that\nbecause of that creation of there wasn't\nsafety it wasn't safe for me to\nemotionally say i had a bad day at\nschool or this is what's going on with\nme mom um just like you didn't also have\nthat safety so what do we do we adapt it\nwe lie we minimize we don't share we we\nsweep it under the rug we present\nsomething different so i know what that\ntranslated for me into adulthood was oh\ni had relationships i spent much of my\nadult life in new york city and i always\nhad a social life people around me i\nmean i was never alone yet i might as\nwell have felt like the most lonely\nperson in the most crowded room\nbecause that lack of right intimacy and\nactual emotion on the walls that we\nbuild the masks that we wear really do\nkeep us then disconnected from the true\nself and therefore we're never then to\nbe known by anyone else\nyeah yeah i mean it's a goal right it's\na goal\nwe're hoping one day i'm hoping that i\nhave enough years that i can i can get\nto that point but having the trust\nwith a parent which of course the book\nis about all the you know the lies and\nthe secrets kept from me that really\nseismically changed my life you know\nbeing able to know your children and\nknow yourself and then pass that along\nto other generations or to siblings\ngrown siblings or have these\nconversations\ni was able to have some of those\nconversations with my brother and it's\nit's almost infectious once you can get\npeople to think\ndifferently about the relationships\nwithin the family right i see you know\nyou've got this little ecosystem going\non\num and once you start changing you know\nmaybe not everybody's gonna like it but\nif someone's receptive to the idea of\nyou saying look we each grew up in a\ndifferent\nfamily\nwe didn't even have the same\nparents in many ways because if you\nthink about your own life and you slice\nit over the years\nyou were very different from this age to\nthis age and your life was different\nyour income your position your\nrelationships your everything and\nthinking about your parents and your\nfamily that way\nit helps with that ability to kind of\nseparate yourself and have a better\nrelationship\nyes and i think the next quote very um\nopportunely really because highlight\nthis um i write you right hurt people\nhurt people but that's not something\nthat's easy to think about when you're\nthe one being hurt especially as a child\nyet it seemed this saying held very true\nfor mom\nbirth of trauma i was beginning to\nunderstand the odds against her more and\nmore to feel more for her\nthan against her\nyeah for sure\nit is incredibly hard to do but if you\ncan do it it's so freeing to yourself\ni think part of the thing is that when\nwhen i\nyou know think about or when some people\nthink about forgiveness they think it's\nfor the person who's hurt you\nit is so much about you just letting go\nof that\num and a big part of me i you know\npeople ask me really good do you forgive\nyour parents and i'm like i don't know\nnicole don't be disappointed with me i'm\nkind of like i don't know\ni don't know if that's the word i think\nthe word is i understand\nand\nthat's\nit feels good to understand now\ndifferent levels of i guess forgiveness\ni don't know i don't know nicole you\nknow that's like as you said it's like a\nwhole process right\nthat takes time and work and\nyou know i hope to get it to even more\npeace and i'm hoping with this book and\nconversations with people like you and\nreaders in general who bring their own\nsituations to me\nthat we can all kind of\nmove ahead\nin that process\nyeah absolutely um and i think it is it\nis through like we were saying when we\nbegan here it is it is through these\nconversations it is through\nconversations first and foremost with\nourselves um i focus a lot on our own\npart of the recovery journey of the\nhealing journey and you know before\nwe're even sharing our awareness our\nunderstanding or where we are in our\nprocess you know of healing with anyone\nelse before we do go back to the family\nand say hey you know this this was what\nit was for me and you might have had a\ndifferent experience but this is what\ni'm going to honor we really do need\nthat that space because when we do go\nback into that system\nwe don't actually know\nwhat the reaction is that we're going to\nget from these others around us because\nwe it's important or at least it's\nhelpful for us to acknowledge that they\ntoo are locked probably in this system\nand in all of these habits and patterns\nright that they were that were an\nadaptation for them as well and i think\nsomething that's not often talked about\num i like to think about grief a lot in\nterms of our own healing and we don't\nthink about that i think it's\ncounterintuitive to think about the\nprocess of grieving when we're like\nhealing from something but as far as i\nsee it that is part of it right for a\nlot of us we are grieving those old\nbehaviors that once did soothe us or\nserve us we might be grieving\nrelationships that are now shifting and\nchanging as we're leaning into or\nspeaking our truth\nwe're grieving aspects of ourself right\nnew ways that we're going to show up\nthat are going to feel unfamiliar and\nscaring and we're leaving behind\nidentities you know relationships and\nstructures again that some of us have\nrelied on our entire\nlife so when we do go back and i know i\nexperienced this in my own journey to\nthese families of origin and begin to\nhave these conversations or just bring\nup you know these new awarenesses that\nwe're having sometimes it can be really\nchallenging\nfor the siblings or the other family\nmembers to begin to hear this new\nversion\nof events and i don't know if you've had\na similar experience or how it was for\nyou to be able to begin to i should say\nintegrate um some of these new truths\nand then even more so um how it is for\nthe family to have this now book out in\nthe world\nyeah\noh if you ask the toughest question of\nall right this is for me the toughest\nbecause it's the most currently\npainful question\num\ni you know you read the book i made sure\nyou know there are no villains\nin the book i treated everybody with\nempathy and respect\num\nbut not everybody wants their story to\nbe told\ni try to be careful right i don't name\nnames\num\ni know that my younger siblings who you\nknow were from my mother's second\nmarriage\num\nare not as receptive\nright uh but we're not as close i was\nmuch much closer with my brother he and\ni were we're the wongs we were the we\nwere the first the city kids right\num\nand in terms of my stepfather you know i\ndon't know\ni don't know if he'll read it i don't\nknow\ni don't know but here's what i've one of\nmy sisters who i'm very close with is\nthe one the first one after me\nshe's very supportive she says carmi\nit's your story\nyou need to tell your story\ni have my story we each have our stories\nand that's a tremendous gift that she's\ngiven me\num because she understands that\nand gets that\nand it's big but it's uncomfortable\nit's uncomfortable um but it's big i\neven uncomfortable i had my launch event\nlast night and i had my daughter was\nthere and my two nieces the twins the\nwong twins my late brothers daughters\nand they're 18 years old\nand people are asking me questions where\ni have to talk about some\nrather adult\nthings and things that they didn't know\nabout their father\nyou know or about me and afterwards you\nknow we're back home and it's late and\nwe're tired and of course we ordered\njunk food delivery and we're all sitting\nthere to the counter you know eating on\nthe kitchen counter\nand um they said i didn't know that\nabout daddy or i didn't know that about\nyou\nbut they loved it\ni said what else\ni didn't know about this i didn't know\nthis about poppy wong i didn't know this\nabout\nthey loved it because\nto them these stories are part of their\nstory\nit explains why their father was a\ncertain way it explains why our\nrelationship was a certain way\nit explains why one of them said to me\nis my mom your best friend\nthis is my sister-in-law my brother's\nwife and i said\nshe's my sister\nshe's my big sister\nand that's that's the truth so\nliving in that and handing that down\nthey weren't uncomfortable they were\nthrilled and not just because it was\ngossipy but because they really were\nlike i'm getting to know\nmy tia i'm getting to know my mom more\num and our stories so\nyeah it depends on who you are yeah and\nthat's such a beautiful point um even\nin the instances where the new knowings\nor information you know might not always\nbe pleasant you know maybe there's a\ndifficult story or piece of information\nto hear um and i do think a lot of us we\nprevent ourselves we censor we decide\nnot to tell\nour truth in fear of the impact that it\nwill have on these other people though\nto speak to that point even if there is\na\nmore upsetting or distressing reaction\nto whatever it is there is also the\nknowing of it and i you know i do think\nsome of us don't give\nthe\ngenerations you know the children or\nreally anyone to be a human on this\nearth is to be in as far as i'm\nconcerned an attuned creature so even if\nwe don't have the words or or the\nlanguage or the story that maybe now you\nyou know carmen come and offer somewhere\nin their later adult years\nthey have the knowing right it lives in\ntheir body they might have had the\nexperience or been impacted somewhere\ndown the generational line of that\nexperience so it's it's there it just\ndoesn't have\nthe the words the actual kind of\ncognitive understanding which so i think\nthat you very beautifully illustrate it\nwith your nieces is so incredibly\nimportant when it's then given or gifted\neven if it does come with the distress\ni think that shift can can bring\nthat awareness and having gone through\nand still to this day when i first\nstarted sharing online i remember my dad\num over\nout of concern for my mom who was alive\nat the time and her reaction there was a\nlot of conversation and questioning my\nway of nicole why do you need to use us\nas your example why do we need to be\nbecause you're mine\nright i'm like well because it's kind of\nthe only experience i had but i\nunderstand where they came from again\nthis very protected what will people\nthink\num you know place of concern and there\nwas many moments where i had to have\nthat you know a similar moment of like\nwell whose truth is this and how\nimportant is it\nfor me to say what it is with the hope\nthat even if it is distressing for my\nmom my dad or whomever it is to hear\nthat there is again going full circle\nthere's value in it not only for myself\nwho had the lifetime of watering down my\ntruth and telling people what they\nwanted to hear not to upset them so my\nown being right has now a new outlet to\nlive in the truth but like you were\nsharing initially\nthis is how we we change we share\nstories we see those moments of\nintersection of similarity and also\nthose moments of difference that make us\ni believe the most diverse varied and\ncooperatives species that you know we\ndon't always i think live into but it's\npeople like yourself that are sharing\nand i'm happy we kind of came down this\npath because you know it occurs to me\nwhen we're take when we're talking about\nourselves there is an impact beyond\nbeyond ourselves that a lot of us can i\nthink get caught up in\num and it's not to say to do so in a\ncallus in a cold way like like you were\nsharing empathetic understanding\ncompassionate and there's a way that\nthese things can be discussed that i\nbelieve can be of incredible value\nyes for sure and and going back to where\nwe're talking about you know lies and\nthings\nthe things that keep us separate when\nyou show up with that truth you're\ncloser\nyou're so much closer like i'm so much\ncloser with my nieces because we speak\nvery openly\nwhich sometimes they're not able to do\nwith their mom or with other members of\ntheir family um they know they can come\nto me with anything\ni yeah i'm that auntie right i'm back to\nyou but but even my daughter the same\nthing\ni don't want her to have to live in a\nspace where she cannot be herself and\nfeel her feelings\nit's something i was not allowed to do i\ncould not be sad i could not be angry i\nbetter wipe that look off my face i\nbetter you know all of these things\nmy goodness it it rots you it it\ndestroys it's really terrible i don't\nwant her to have to go through that and\nit's amazing when you stop that\nand that took training for me too by the\nway i didn't i didn't come out when she\nwas like a baby and i was like i know\nexactly what i'm doing i'm not going to\nrepeat anything that was ever taught to\nme\nno\nit took many years along i wish i was\nwho i am now at the beginning when she\nwas a baby but\nit's been you know a process and i i've\ndefinitely\nmuch more lean on that side of letting\nher be you're sad i'm not going to say\ndon't be sad\nwhich would be my instant reaction right\nit's not that bad\ninstant reaction those are the things\nthat come out of me that i\nknow reacting\nlet me just take a breath\nand it's\nhuge it really changes so much when you\njust take that one breath\nlife changing life changing\nthe modeling you know that we're\noffering it regardless of how ever old\nwe are when we you know begin a journey\nof knowing ourself of understanding you\nknow our past in a different way or\nshowing up newly um whatever time frame\nthat that happens the gift that we're\ngiving in that moment is is the gift of\nshowing change of acknowledging and i\nthink to speak to the point of truth and\nlying there's so much value even though\ni know a lot of us as humans and parents\nin particular we don't want to admit\nwhen we weren't so shiny in a moment\nwith our child we don't want to say hey\nmom messed up and you know shouldn't\nhave screamed and yelled in that way um\nyet those truthful moments where we even\nhonor our shortcomings in as close to\nreal time as possible are such human\nteaching moments because the message\nwe're giving our child is that a not\nonly is it okay to be human and to say\nor do something that we might not mean\nin a moment it's also okay to be honest\nand to share those things without i\nthink the shame that prevents so much of\nus from sharing that that's the big word\nshame that's the thing is that with the\nsecrets i mean the amount of uh shame\nthat lived in the house that i was\nraised in that lived in the family that\ni was raised in it was as if almost\nevery decision my mother made was out of\nsome kind of shame right a need\ncombined with shame\nled to the secrets\nand that\nbeing like you you read that passage\nabout me you know being in my bed where\nshe's like yelling at me and me feeling\nashamed of myself the way i've done\nnothing wrong\nthat shame is that little voice that you\nhear i try to turn that voice down i\npretend that there's a volume and i try\nto physically imagine myself as you can\nsee i'm a very visual person as i you\nknow but try to imagine myself turning\nthat down and turning up the other voice\nbecause i what i learned was like i\ncan't get rid of it\ncompletely\nbut i don't have to let it rule my life\ni don't have to let it make decisions\nfor me\num and i think that you know we can even\ninfect our friends with that\nwe can even you know because you see\nlike you're with friends they're like oh\nno i can't talk about or no and you can\nfeel and sense their shame and you're\nlike why not i it's all right\nlike it's okay\nand\nthey relax they feel more comfortable in\nthemselves\nyou can bring so many people to that\nplace with your story\nwith your process\nthat's what i was trying to do\nyes well carmen you in my opinion you do\nsuch a beautiful job your book is so\neloquently written like i said it's so\nrich not only in your own journey your\nstory to speak to everything we've been\ntalking about here today\nbut really illustrating i think the\nintergenerational patterning the\nsocietal you know structures that really\ndo get imprinted into us and we want to\ntalk about shame and how we carry with\nus into for some of us our lifetime\nthese early early experiences until of\ncourse we you know begin to to look at\nthem anew and this can happen at at any\ntime and the gift that you're sharing\nwith the world and sharing your story in\nthis way is is so great um and i'm so\nexcited to
