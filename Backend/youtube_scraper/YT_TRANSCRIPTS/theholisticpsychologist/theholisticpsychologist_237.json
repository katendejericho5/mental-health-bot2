    "transcript": "your mind and body messengers\nthis video will go over\nneurotransmitters\nwhat they are and how they affect us\nwe'll talk a bit about two particular\nneurotransmitters dopamine and serotonin\nand their effects on our wellness\nand then we'll end by exploring\ndifferent ways to begin to balance each\nof those neurotransmitters\nso as we get started what are\nneurotransmitters and why are they\nimportant\nso you can think of neurotransmitters as\nchemical substances they're released\nthroughout our body and they affect its\noverall functioning and our wellness\nthe two main neurotransmitters that\nwe're going to cover here in part one\nare serotonin and dopamine\nso let's talk a bit about serotonin\nfirst\nwhat are its main functions\nit enhances mood or in other words it\ndecreases the symptoms of depression\nit regulates our appetite and our\ndigestion\nit helps us control our impulses or\nthink before we act\nand it has a role in our cognitive\nhealth particularly our ability to to\nform and store memories\nso here are different signs that your\nserotonin might be imbalanced\nyou have worry or other symptoms of\nanxiety\nor obsessive-compulsive disorder\nyou might have a difficulty sleeping\nyou might be impulsive not thinking\nbefore you act and you might notice food\ncravings for carbs and sugar in\nparticular\nso here are some ways to increase your\nserotonin\nexercise moving your body\nsuddenly getting out in the sun as\nsimple as that letting the sun hit your\nskin eating foods that are high in\nomega-3 fatty acids some examples are\nmackerel cod liver oil walnuts sardines\nanother way to increase serotonin is to\nthink about or to imagine happy memories\nour mind is so powerful that the act of\nimagining this positive emotion can help\nincrease the serotonin in your body\nand of course so can supplements\ntaking 5-htp\nor cod liver oil which helps in the\nproduction of serotonin\nhow about dopamine what are its general\nfunctions\nagain like serotonin it enhances mood\ndecreasing the symptoms of depression\nit plays a role in motivation or it\nactivates our reward system helping us\naction on intentions ideas wants causes\nmotivation really simply\nit also activates pleasure it's\notherwise known as the feel good hormone\nwhen we're feeling good it's likely\ndopamine is playing a role\nit also plays a role in our attention\nthe more dopamine we have the more able\nwe are to pay attention\nso here are some signs of a dopamine\nimbalance\nyou have an apathy or really simply what\nthat means is a lack of pleasure you\ndon't feel pleasure at all you might\nfeel really flat blah\nlow motivation very similarly it's hard\nto action nothing really feels rewarding\nyou might find yourself not really\ntaking action at all as a result\na lot of times you'll feel mental\nfatigue or\nreally hard heavy in your mind hard to\nthink straight trouble focusing you\nmight see thrill or pleasure seeking\nbehaviors remember because dopamine is\nour feel good hormone sometimes we so\ndesperately try to activate the feel\ngood through our actions jumping out of\nairplanes doing things that are on the\nedge of life again trying to get that\nhit of that feel-good hormone\nwe might even suffer a low sex drive not\nreally have interest in or energy for\nany sort of sexual behavior or activity\nso what are some ways that we might\nbegin to increase our dopamine\nsuddenly again similar to getting out\nletting the sun hit your skin\nsleep\nmaking sure that you're getting the\namount of hours of sleep you need and\nremembering that sleep is when our body\nis actually sleeping not just the amount\nof time we're spending in our bed\nscrolling on our phones\nexercise sometimes these are connected\nthe more we're moving our body\nthroughout our day the more sleep we\nmight find available at night time\nmeditation is another great way to\nincrease dopamine start small maybe one\nminute each day that one minute will\nhelp increase your body's dopamine\nso will eating foods high in something\ncalled tyrosine\nexamples of this food are grass-fed\nmeats\npastured eggs organic dairy beans and\nother legumes\nand then of course there's supplements\njust like getting that sunlight on your\nskin stimulates vitamin d\ntaking a vitamin d supplement especially\nif you don't live in a climate where you\nhave sunlight consistently available\nprobiotics are very helpful\ndopamine is actually produced all over\nour body and particularly in our gut\ntaking a good probiotic will help your\nbody naturally produce the amount of\ndopamine it needs\nso how can we begin to increase dopamine\nwe can make a small daily promise by\npicking one of those activities maybe\nit's making a commitment to get 10\nminutes in sunshine or go to bed 10\nminutes earlier\nthe more consistently you are with those\nactions the more over time you'll begin\nto feel the effects of increased\nserotonin or of increased dopamine\nwhatever it is that you're lacking\ni'd love to hear from you do you\nresonate with any of these symptoms of\ndopamine or serotonin imbalance and how\nis it when you try some of these natural\nways to increase production in your body\nnaturally i'd love to hear from you in\nthe comments below"
