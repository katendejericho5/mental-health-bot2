    "transcript": "have you met your shadow\nthis video will explore what a shadow is\nhow it affects us and of course steps to\nbegin to meet your own\nso what is a shadow\na shadow consists of all of the\nundesirable parts of our self that we\ndeny that we repress or that we suppress\nas a result of our conditioning often as\na result of shameful experiences that\nwe've had in our childhood\nmoments where we were told not to\nsing or dance loudly not to show\nwhatever emotion we were having\nmessages we were given about what's\nappropriate or good or bad all are\nabsorbed by us in childhood the more\nconsistently we hear those messages both\ndirectly and indirectly spoken to us\nlived out around us\nthe more likely we become to suppress to\ndeny and to continue to avoid those same\nparts of our self\nthe issue is however those parts of us\ndon't go away\nthey often contain attributes\npersonality traits emotions thoughts\nthat are still present we're just not\naware of them or we're not able to see\nthem in ourselves\nusually there's two main categories\nnegative things things that we feel\njudgmental or critical about\noftentimes we\njudge those same attributes in someone\nelse while we turn a blind eye or we\ndon't see those aspects of ourselves so\nfor instance we might see someone and\nfeel like they're acting selfish call\nthem selfish and not be able to see the\nmoments in our life where we too can act\nselfishly\na little more counter-intuitively now\nsometimes you can be these can be\npositive attributes that are contained\nin our shadows or things that we\nidealize or celebrate of course in\nsomeone else we might see someone and\nawe at how confident they are and not be\nable to see the moments of confidence in\nourselves\nso how does this affect us why are we\ntalking about these repressed suppressed\nparts of our self that we can't see\nwhen we can't see them it doesn't mean\nthat they're not there and their\npresence inside of us actually affects\nus and affects the world around us\nbecause what we often do then is we\ncontinue to deny or dismiss those\nattributes in our self while at the same\ntime we project them onto other people\nwe become quick to judge quick to\ncriticize quick to label someone else\nthis can contribute to cycles then of\nreactivity of shame where we're shaming\nourselves when these attributes become\npresent or we're shaming other people\nwhen we see those aspects of them\npresent in them\nthis can continue or contribute to\ngetting locked in this cycle of judgment\nof shame and then continued repression\nof these parts of who we are\nso how do we begin to do shadow work or\nhow do we begin to meet our shadow we\nwant to practice witnessing it\nwitnessing it in moments throughout the\nday where you notice yourself being\njudgmental being critical maybe even\nidealizing\nother people or things in your\nenvironment i've included some prompts\nthat you can write down or note down and\nbegin to explore for yourself in your\nday-to-day life\nso notice\nwhat is it that you idealize or praise\nin other\npeople and a follow-up question then\nis what do i think that this other\nperson has\nthat i believe i'm lacking\nyou can begin to explore what traits\nyour parent figures or other loved ones\nthat you grew up with or around what\ntraits did you often find yourself\nfearing that you didn't want to have or\nsee within yourself and of course on the\nother hand\nwhat traits did you see in them that you\nwanted that you idealized\nanother way to explore another\nexploratory question for you all\nis what do you find yourself annoyed by\nwhat are your pet peeves what are the\nthings that when you're scrolling online\nyou feel disgusted by or annoyed by or\nupset by\nthese will all give you information\nright the goal of exploring and meeting\nyour shadow isn't to become more\njudgmental it's to objectively just view\nthese parts of yourself\nbecause what we see in someone else\nchances are positive or negative we have\nin our self too\nand the more present we become to the\nwhole of our experience just because\nwe're not paying attention to these\nthoughts these feelings these traits\nthese attributes doesn't mean that we're\nnot there the more we pay attention to\nthe whole of us the more we can feel\nwhole i'd love to hear from all of you\nlistening have you ever heard of a\nshadow and if you have have you met your\nown leave it in the comments below"
