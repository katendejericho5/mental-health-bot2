days so gabby first and\nforemost thank you for taking the time\nto have a chat with me about your new\nbook happy days\nlisten lady this is one of\ntop podcast on my list i said to my\npublicist and to you i said this is my\ndream\nam i your first interview\nyou are officially our first interview\non the south miller soundbird\nsomebody can't i'm like panting like a\ndog this is real i'm first of all so\ndeeply honored and grateful\nit's one of my favorite podcasts and i i\njust you know how much i adore you and\nand you've been a really big part of my\nown recovery journey and\ni just think you're a genius and i'm so\nhappy to be here with you\nand i mean that with all of my heart and\ni am so grateful to have my kitten in\nthe room with us as well\ni'd be a little purring in the\nbackground well thank you me and jimmy\nblue here we are honored i wish my\nkittens could be behaved enough to be\nhere they have to get locked in a room\nevery time i'm filming because they will\nbe crawling all over the table though\ni'm very happy jimmy blue is here with\nus um so speaking of your journey i i\nactually wanted to get started with\nasking you because i know you share a\nwhole ton of your story and even i think\nsomeone was it your publicist or your\neditor or someone was actually waving\nflags at you\nasking you if you were you know\ncomfortable with the degree of which you\nwere sharing so much of your journey so\nhow was it for you i guess the process\nof writing the book the process of\nhaving so much of your story now getting\nready to be out in the world for public\nconsumption how was it to be so\nvulnerable throughout those pages of the\nbook\nwell i opened the book as you mentioned\nwith this story from my publisher saying\nwe're nervous for you gabby you've put\nso much into this and it's just one\nfearful uncomfortable story after the\nnext and\njust you're you're we feel like you're\ntoo vulnerable\nand i and then they said you're not\nshowing your true\nstrength and my response was\nmy ability to be this vulnerable\nis my true strength\nnow\nthat\nis the bottom line here is that the\nbravery that it takes to go to the\nplaces that scare us and come out the\nother side\nand also share as to their point there\nwas there were some adjustments i made\nafter that big conversation because to\ntheir point\nthere even though i was going through so\nmuch for the past 42 years um i've also\ni've also had a lot of light and a lot\nof strength and a lot of power and a lot\nof uh\nservice and\nbeautiful gifts i've been able to\ncontribute\neven in the midst of going through\ndifficult times\nwhich is really important to start with\nbecause we can go through\ntrauma with a big t trauma with a small\nteam we can go through the journey that\nit takes to recover\nand still have fun along the way and\nstill do good things along the way still\nhave breakthrough moments and\nmoments of up leveling\nit can be a really beautiful path\nespecially with guidance yeah i love how\nyou're describing you know very\naccurately i would agree vulnerability\nwith strength and i actually want to\nread\ni\nplucked a couple quotes out that just\nreally struck me and\nthe first one is i am free from my past\nbecause i became brave enough to face\nthe deeper reasons behind my suffering\nand fearlessly show up for my healing\nessentially you go on to acknowledge and\nuncover a deep belief that i was\nunworthy of a life of happiness and\npeace and i think what you're describing\nnow right this other side of\nof the rawness of vulnerability of our\nstories and really describing it as\nfearless and strength and\nyou know i would throw it resilient the\nability to bear witness to all of our\nsuffering and\neverything that has happened to us and\nbecome now an accumulation of\nfor many of us the cycles of suffering\nthat we're still stuck in\nhow much that is for most of us the most\nfoundational the most beginning part of\na healing journey and how painful and\nraw it can be\nyeah yeah\nand that the bravery and the willingness\nto go there is the first step to\nresilience\nis the first step in the journey of\ncoming to the other side you have to uh\nmake that commitment\ni'm ready to go\nyeah\nso being brought up let's talk a little\nbit about you know the differences in\nall of the teas the big tea the small\ntea\nwhat you have come to realize and again\ni want to go back to another quote\nbecause i just think some of the\nlanguage you used gabby just so\nbeautiful\nyou acknowledged\nthe painful experiences we had as kids\nyou know kind of joining the collective\ninto this statement because i do think\nit resonates with a lot of us painful\nexperiences we had as kids were\nfractures in our energetic connection to\nthe love within us or the god within us\nand\nyou know so when you think about trauma\nin all of its forms and you you apply\nthis this beautiful language of it being\na fracture you know to the energetic\nconnection of love within us can you can\nyou say a little more about what you've\ncome to realize about our past and our\npresent our connection or disconnection\nfrom from love or from source\nyeah i'd love to share that from a\nspiritual perspective at a therapeutic\nperspective because\ni believe that when we have these\ntraumatic events in our childhood where\nour system gets overwhelmed and we can't\nbring ourselves back to safety or\nself-regulation\nwe have what in a from a spiritual\nstandpoint is almost like a soul\ndeparture\ni share in the book about how i had this\num this this shamanic healing young when\ni was maybe like 20 something and the\nshaman said i see you at this young age\nand there's a part of your soul being\nseparated and similar to the way i\nreferenced it as a fracture\nwhat i know to be true from that\nspiritual sense and from a therapeutic\nsense is\nthat\nwhen we have these\nmoments in time\nthat shock our system\nbig t trauma or small t trauma\nwe do in a way\nseparate\nin my case seriously i went into\ndissociation\nand left my left left walk just\nseparated from that memory tucked it\naway\nand forgot\nbut my body never forgot\nand then from a therapeutic standpoint\nyou know i'm now trained in ifs and\ninternal family systems therapy which i\nknow you're a fan of and\nfrom an ifs perspective we\nbecome\nthose moments in time\nbecome so severe that we exile those\nchild parts\nand we separate them\nand we put them away and we say no i'm\nnot going to go there under lock and key\nno thank you\nand then we build up all these other\nfragmented parts of ourselves to protect\nus from ever having to face those\nimpermissible feelings\nand so really what this\nwhat this book really is is it's a\njourney of reclaiming\nthose child parts\nand\nhelping them feel safe enough in our\ninternal system\nand really starts with just\nacknowledging that they're there\nacknowledging that they have been\nfractured and cut off\nand\nit's a slow study process people may be\nlike well i don't even know what that is\nand i guide you there and\ni understand that fracture very deeply\nand intimately\nso you're saying something really\nprofound and and that i talk a lot about\num in my work and in our circle which is\nyou know safety and we're really\nbeginning to understand and explore\nall of these parts of ourself right the\nthoughts we think the habits the way we\nfeel how we show up in our relationships\nour for a lot of us until we become\nconscious our general way of being\nbe has has been born out of at least in\nmy opinion\nthat desire for safety trying to find\nand create\nsafety for ourselves within whatever\nenvironment it was that we were born\ninto whatever environment we were living\nin whatever family structure that was\nwhen we didn't have consistently attuned\ncaregivers which is a a tall order to\nhave a human be\nfirst and foremost regulated within\ntheir own emotional selves aware of\ntheir own needs and then therefore able\nto\nbe safe space for someone else even if\nthat's someone else's that is their\nchild\nthat's a lot to do as a parent and\nfor the large majority of us who didn't\nhave that very receptive attuned\nself-regulating caregiver\nsomething led us into that shock feeling\nand oftentimes it was a consistent\nsomething of shock and of overwhelm that\ncreated these fractured parts that\nyou're describing and\nthen flash forward however amount of\ntime it is into adulthood\nwhat most of us become aware of first\nbefore we understand all the layers of\nit i do want to talk a little bit about\nthe parts and\nyou know how we can think and work with\nthem before we understand that\nwhat most of us come to the awareness of\nis how our general way of being the\nhabits and patterns that we're living\naren't serving us and you talk and share\num about you know kind of your\nyou kind of addictive like behavior for\nlack of a better word and the different\nways it was socially acceptable in love\nendless achievement\ndrive that i very very much relate to\nmyself um so can you share a little bit\nabout kind of your\nbefore journey of healing and what your\nsafety behaviors look like and and how\nthey manifested in the world so that for\nlisteners out there who you know maybe\naren't yet sure of the underneath might\nsee parts of themselves literally parts\nin their attempts to\ncreate safety\nyeah\nwell it all began in this book with this\nstory of me\nuh in a my beat up white toyota corolla\ni'm 24\nand a half years old\ni'm sitting in the car i haven't slept\nthe night before\nand i have this like you know empty\ngatorade bottle on the ground and i'm\ntotally hungover and\njust 30 minutes ago i was at an after\nparty and i'm in the car adhering to the\nalternate side of the street parking\nregulations\nand i keep pressing play and rewind on a\ncassette tape yes i'm dating myself i'm\ngoing back and forth with this cassette\ntape that i have listened to over a\nthousand times and it's a recording of a\npsychic reading that i'd had five months\nearlier and the psychic says to me\nyou're struggling with drugs and alcohol\nand i say\nwith a real quivering voice and i\nrespond it's not that bad\nand she carries on and says\nyou have two choices in this lifetime\nyou can\nchoose to carry on the way you are and\nit will be really difficult for you\nor you can get sober\nand make a major impact on the world\nand i keep rewinding and playing and\nrewinding and playing because in that\nmoment\ni couldn't contemplate what that could\nbe how could i\nhave an impact how could i in this\nmoment of cocaine addiction and\nalcoholism and\nsevere ego suffering codependency\nfull-blown terror and trauma in my body\nand and not even and no awareness of why\nno awareness of why\nby the grace of god i did get clean and\nsober half a year later\nand in my sobriety i really started to\ntry to\nheal and\ndeepen my spiritual faith and just went\ndiving deep into my spiritual practices\nand lots of therapy\nbut let's call it 11 years into my\nrecovery i still didn't know why\nwhy was i a drug addict why was a\ncocaine addict why was i a control freak\nwhy was i now workaholic why was i so\nseverely codependent why was i always\ntrying to\nto control every detail\nwhy was i\nwould fly off the handle whenever i felt\nout of control\nwhy why why why why\nand here i was it was 2016 i'm 36 years\nold i'd probably written six or seven\nbooks at this point i'd been on oprah\ni'd had so many beautiful opportunities\nin my life to be of service to people in\na big way but i was still\nmassively suffering\nand\nit was bad it got bad at this point it\nstarted to crack and crack and crack and\ni want to really describe this because i\nthink a lot of your listeners may have\nexperienced this or may in the future\nit's important to know that this is\nsomething that happens\nwith a lot of love and compassion i want\nto hold everybody in a beautiful blanket\nof safety but what can happen is we bury\nthose exiled experiences so deep\nthat we dissociate from them and so i\nbegan to start cracking cracking\ncracking and my mantra at the time\nnicole was i can't go on like this i\ncan't go on like this\nand then i had a dream\nand the dream was\nof being an adult confronting the fact\nthat i'd been sexually abused as a child\nand when i woke up from that dream it\nwas so real\nthat i just shut it down i was like no\n[ __ ] way i'm not going here it's\nunder lock and key never touching this\nagain it just feels way too real no\nthank you\nand a few days later i was in therapy\nand my therapist said a few things that\nreally ignited me into a full-blown\nmemory of a dissociation that i'd 30\nyears ago earlier had an experience\nand i remembered it in my body i\nremembered it in my\nconscious awareness i didn't have all\nthe details but i stepped into the\nmemory\nthat\nday was\nhorrific and terrifying and carried on\nlike that for many many months after\nbut it was also relieving\nbecause in that moment i said\nah\nthis is why i've been running\nthis is what i've been running from\nand so as we start to tap into and get\ncloser to an honor and recognize whether\nit's in a memory or just in a therapy\nsession or just in a book like happy\ndays or in a book like yours start to\ntap into\nthe why and become brave enough to\nwonder why\nwe can start to understand\nwhy we are how we are\nwe can start to have\ndeep and and profound compassion\nfor our addictive parts for our\nour\nour sort of misbehaved parts our parts\nthat are extreme\nand we can say oh okay i understand\nthere's a fracture\nthis this child part has been locked\nunder lock and key locked up not allowed\nout\nand\nthe journey of\nretrieving that part and the journey of\nreally soothing your system\nyour whole system\nis on the pages of this book and it\nshares\nmy journey to one like you said\nhelp people know they're not alone to\nhelp them recognize themselves in my\nstory or just in my suffering\nand to to\nreally see that there is a path out\nthat there's a guided path out\nand you're you're\nopening the door gabby to that path by\nwhat you're acknowledging right here and\nright now\nwhich is very much in alignment with\nwhat i believe to be true which is that\nthere there is a why\nright the patterns that we're living\nwe're born out of somewhere even for the\nmany of us i'm sure listening that that\nshare a similar deep belief that i read\nearlier that's similar to yours and a\nlot of ours which is of being unworthy\nbeing worthy of a life of happiness for\nme that last piece being a worthy of a\nlife of peace\nall i knew from such a very early age\nwas with stress was worry\nthere was very much a deep root of\nbelief in myself that i did not yet\nuncover as well\nthat was driving a similar dissociative\npattern of running for me trying to find\nthe outward achievement that i could\nsuccessfully attain\nthat would confirm or disconfirm that\ndeep rooted belief\nthat i i that i was indeed worthy if i\ncould find the thing that would\nclick in\nright and unturn what i have believed to\nbe true for the entirety of my 30-some\nyears by the time i began my own healing\njourney as well\ni could feel better about myself yet\nof course right those deep rooted\nbeliefs\ndon't ever get\nrelieved from something outside of our\nself especially when it's belief about\nunworthiness so when that door cracks\nopen and we begin to become curious to\nwhat that why is\num that is for many of us where our\njourney of healing begins and that door\nopening can for some of us offer an\nincredible amount of relief\nfrom\nshame that we've been carrying as we've\nbeen secretly harboring this idea that\nall of what's happening around me is an\nindicator of how unworthy i am that i've\ncaused it in some way while we can\nacknowledge\nthat our past happened to us\nright we can also then shift focus\nand empower ourselves\nto create the change right acknowledging\nthat we much we were very much limited\nin childhood and\nour why\nwas our best attempt at our safety at\nfinding\nourselves yeah yeah and i think that\nfirst for me\nit took me a long many years and a lot\nof different therapeutic processes that\ni share about in this book\nto get to the place to even touch into\nthe shame or to get to the place where\nit was even safe enough to to to witness\nthat this happened to me this wasn't my\nfault\nso and even still i'm working on it you\nknow i'm coming out with this book and\ni'm like oh my so much terror night\nsweats you know like i'm going through\nit right now\nand it's such a journey\nbut i do believe that it begins with\nbeing brave enough to wonder\nand\nwhen we start to\ntap into that awareness\nthat's the that's the door that opens\nthere's this beautiful ammo quote\nthat\nwhen an eggshell cracks from the outside\nit's broken\nbut when it cracks from the inside it's\nreborn\nwhat i love about that for this\nconversation\nis that those moments of cracking as i\ndescribed it when i was cracking into\nthe memory or hitting bottom with\nalcohol and drugs or just hitting enough\nof a bottom where you just look at your\nlife and like is this it i don't want to\ngo on like this i can't live in extreme\nhyper vigilance or i can't live in\nextreme anxiety anymore depression or\nalcoholism or whatever\nthose are the moments when\nwe crack open\nto the greatness of who we are to the\npossibility of who we can be and who we\ncan really return to because we already\nare that we already are that\nbut we reclaim our innocence\nand that's this this is a a it's a it's\na steady journey\nand it begins with that awareness\nand it also begins with a tremendous\namount of self-compassion\nbecause\nthe the\ni've been through this journey and i\ndon't know that i was cultivating as\nnearly as much self-compassion as i have\ntoday and if we can begin the\nconversation by witnessing what's been\nup\nand decide to show up for it\nbut through the lens of\ntremendous compassion for what we've\nbeen through and how we've tried to\nsurvive\nthe journey is a lot easier\nbecause that self-compassion can be the\nleader rather than that self-attack or\nshaming or blaming or judgment towards\nourselves\nso that would be a big thing i'd like if\ni had been where i am if i had known\nwhere i was going to be\nthen in 2016 or even in 20 2005 when i\ngot sober i would love to say to those\nparts of myself\nyou did the best you could\nand you've done a great job to get to\nwhere you are right now\nwell it's in that acknowledgement and\ni think you kind of mentioned more or\nless what i saw as kind of three\ncomponents\nof you know what i would call a healing\njourney\num and the first one is i think what\nwe're talking about right now which is\nwitnessing your suffering right\nwitnessing your pain witnessing your\nsubconscious mind and all of its\ntriggers and that deep wounding and you\nhave this one line where you essentially\nsuggest or utilizing this this concept\nfor yourself and your own journey you\nsay\npaying attention to the minute you want\nto run\nand so that witnessing is is the space i\nthink that we're talking about right now\nwhich is learning how to with compassion\nof course see\nsee all all of the self see all of that\ntendencies and the patternings that we\nhave and the desire to want to run and\nlearning how to then compassionately\nbear witness\nto to that depth of pain that most of us\nare still bringing with us into\nadulthood\nyeah in that in that chapter i\nreally reference this\nopportunity that we have to look at the\ntriggers in our life and then notice the\nfeelings that are behind those triggers\nand then notice all the ways that we try\nto avoid those feelings\nbecause\nthe triggers are activating a feeling\nthat's impermissible the exiled child\nparts of us\nand then the ways that we run from those\nfeelings are these protector parts\nthey're the parts that are trying to\nnumb it out\ncontrol work sex love porn\neven just spirituality can be a\nprotector part you know spiritual\nbypassing which is what i did for many\nyears and frankly all these protectors\nare good parts they all have a lot of\nimportant roles in our life\nthese ways that we protect ourselves but\nthe goal is to help them be less extreme\nyeah i love you introing this or\nre-introing this concept of of parts um\nyou know and i think that example here\nis so important acknowledging the\nwounding of the part so i feel unworthy\ni feel fearful i feel abandoned i feel\nrejected all the different things that\ncould be activated activate it in that\nmoment and then again what is my\nattempt to run how am i trying to\nreestablish safety what am i doing as a\nresult of that part and that deep rooted\npain or that deep-rooted fear and can i\nbegin to see clearly the whole story for\nmyself instead of just focusing on\nthe running or the shame or the yelling\nor whatever it is i did as a result\nunderstanding that we do have these\ndeep-rooted parts of us that still have\nstory pain experiences\nnarratives beliefs\ncoping mechanisms all from our childhood\nthat then do awash us and become very\npresent to us in real time and that's\nwhen you say kind of witness when when\nyou want to run and almost dive then in\nfrom that point\nand allow the space for that deeper\nfeeling of i'm scared i'm being rejected\ni'm scared i'm not loved right now i'm\nscared that what's happening is\nindication that i'm not worthy yeah in\nthis moment you know i think that\nthere's there's something important that\nmy therapist once said to me\nyour trauma shows up in how you brush\nyour teeth\nit's it's everywhere it's it's it's just\nit's\nwe build up a world around us with all\nof these protection mechanisms otherwise\nknown as protector parts\nto\nmanage\nthe impermissible to manage the child\nthat was abused to manage the child that\nwas neglected to manage this the\nsix-year-old that was told they were\nstupid whatever the trauma with the big\nt trauma with a small t is\nwe're managing managing managing\nand\nthese managers are in these extreme\nroles\nthat turn into addiction that become so\nextreme that they become burnout that\nthey can take us to the psych ward that\nthey can bring us to our knees with\nphysical psychosomatic responses\nand so\nwe\nwhat the goal is ultimately\nand this is back to internal family\nsystems but also it's quite very similar\nto my spiritual beliefs that i've been\nteaching for decades\nis that we have to\nestablish a greater\nextraordinary connection to what is\nknown as self\nand self with a capital s\nand some people might call that higher\nself or they might call it inner\nguidance system or god or universe\nbut it's a non-physical presence within\nourselves it's called self with a\ncapital s and it is compassionate\nit is calm it is creative it is\ncourageous curious\nand when we start to develop that\nconnection to self\nwe can then let self\nbe the leader of these extreme parts\nso rather than letting the extreme parts\nrun the show you know letting my 10 year\nold self show up to work and try to\ncontrol [ __ ] you know\nor letting my you know\nmy my rager part show up in my marriage\nwhen i'm activated you know i can let\nself show up this is a practice and i\ngive lots of methods for it in the book\nbut you can establish that connection to\nthat compassion that's why i mentioned\nthe compassion upfront\nyou can establish some curiosity much\nlike what you just said nicole when you\nsaid looking more closely what what's\nbehind this what do you need to feel\nright now what do you need right now\nas we develop this level of\nenergetic awareness of that self energy\nwe can then extend that self energy to\nthese extreme parts of ourselves\nand that would look like this it would\nlook like\nyou know let's say something got really\nmessed up but my in one of my old\ntriggers was like when things went wrong\nwith my work stuff and i was out of\ncontrol\nand one of the ways that i maintained\ncontrol over those impermissible\nfeelings was workaholism stress you know\njust trying to control everything\nreally dominant it was really not cool\nenergy and when something would go out\nof control like the website went down or\nthe webinar blew up or whatever\ni'd go [ __ ] crazy\nand god bless the people that used to\nwork\nand\nin those moments\ni would just not have the awareness\nitself i just went would go get\ndissociate and check out into the to the\npart that was so activated so i would go\nso into the controller part\nand now if something's not going well\ni can\nnotice the controller part start to come\nup\nand then i can\nliterally\ntune into\nself\ncompassion courage\ncalm\ncreative\nand start to\njust\nbe the witness of that part and simply\nbegin a dialogue with it\nwhat do i notice about that part\nwhat does it need from me right now\nhow can i\nsupport that part in this moment\nhow can i extend compassion to that part\nhow can i calm that part and soothe that\npart\nand this is a practice i mean i've been\nin therap in this ifs therapy for 10\nyears and i just did the training so\nthis is something that comes very easily\nto me now and it's not something that\nsomebody's going to get overnight but i\nwanted to really explain the\npossibility here\nwhich is that you have an internal\nparent that's [ __ ] awesome\nand\nwhen you connect to that internal parent\nknown as self\nyour life becomes so much easier\nbecause you're no longer extremely\nrunning in all these extreme managing\nways\ni even love um the fact that when ifs is\nbuilt on and the language it uses is\npart\num i think for so many of us that can\noffer healing here as well like we were\ntalking about earlier\nour actions don't make us who we are\nright because a lot of times our actions\ncome from this deep wounding and again\nour best attempts at at survival at\nsafety um\nso\nthis idea that when i'm acting in my\npart it is just that it's a part of who\ni am it does not make me\nwho i am ultimately and this self-space\ncapital s that you're describing here\nyou know it is very much i think what\nwhat we're all journeying toward or\nwondering if we have inside of us this\nintuition this guidance right this\ncenter being and it is i want to\nhighlight\na being state because a lot of us i see\nlook into our minds we think it's going\nto talk to us in the very narrative\nbased way that most of our thoughts do\nthis intuition this guidance and in\nreality at least the way i experience it\ni describe it it's\nour knowings don't come from our\nthinking mind they again come from this\na different state of consciousness where\nwe're in our being if you ask me where\nwe're connected to our heart space\nwhere we're actually embodying a\ndifferent level of consciousness and i\nthink this applies into the second\nfoundational pillar if you will of\nhealing that you offer which is creating\na new vision and rewiring\nyour brain and i'll even add in your\nbody and i know that you do share a lot\nof the body based stuff the somatic\nright in terms of\nthis journey is about\nmore than just thinking thoughts in a\ndifferent way it's quite literally about\nembodying self and self energy and doing\nthe body or the somatic work to actually\ncreate that level of safety and of\nconsciousness so that we can begin then\nto hear the mutterings of that intuition\nor of that capital s self yeah it's a\nbeautiful point because\nthe trauma recovery journey has so many\nlayers\nand it can and it's very gentle and it's\nand it can be slow it i i wish you a\nslow recovery because the slower you go\nthe more\ndetailed the\nrecognition of all those layers is and\nthe more you can comb through those\nlayers and start to peel back the onion\nand just get closer and closer to the\ncore\nand what i have experienced in my own\nrecovery is that\nthere was years of\nthis journey of spiritual development\nthat had to come first\nand then there was\nbody-based somatic work that came\nthrough when i felt safe enough to go\ninto my body\nand there was emdr that came through at\na different time eye movement\ndesensitization and reprocessing which\nis\nbilateral brain stimulation which allows\nyou to really open up your window of\ntolerance to manage to\nto reprocess\ndisturbances\nand all these different therapies and\nall these different spiritual practices\ncame at the exact right time in order\nfor me and everyone's going to have a\ndifferent order but your system\ncan open you up to what's next your\nliteral literally your inner sense of\nsafety will say okay i'm safe enough\nto go there now i remember asking my\ntherapist why did i remember the trauma\nnow at 36 and she said because you were\nsafe enough to remember\nand she also said to me yesterday it was\nso crazy she said\nmost people who have a dissociated\nchildhood traumatic event particularly\nsexual in nature\ndon't the average age of remembering is\n52 years old\nthink about how much running\nthat one would go you know they don't\nreally start recovering and feeling\nbetter until they're like 67 you know\nit's like\nand they can start feeling better right\naway once they start to address it\nbut\nthat breaks my heart\nthat\nwe can live a lifetime or half a\nlifetime\nunconscious of unaware of the\npossibilities of safety within ourselves\nit is it's mind-blowing to consider\nand i think the hopeful side of it is\nthe reality that very thankfully and\ngratefully\nthere is not\na too late\nno no when i mean when i say that right\nis that our our brain now and i i share\nthis and i offer this because it\nwas only a\ndistant or not so distant past where in\nthe field at least in my field we\nbelieve that the brain was was done\nchanging at a certain age and into your\n20s that was it there was no possible\nreal possibility of your brain changing\nwe also very much in the field believe\nthat your body could only change the\nextent that its genetics would allow\nthat we were infinitely bound by this\ndna expression inside of us and\nof course while our dna you know does\nplay a role we now know that that isn't\nas true as we once thought our body and\nour brain is capable of of changing\nthroughout life of having this this very\nbeautifully painful journey of\nwitnessing as we're describing of seeing\nall of the different ways that we we are\nrunning and trying to create safety if\nit does happen for us into our 50s our\n60s our 70s there is still the\npossibility to create an incredible\ntransformation\nof of mind and of body and i think\nthat's the hopeful piece here and again\ni'm always reiterating that point\nbecause like i said for a very long time\ni i was even taught differently i was\ntaught very much in that old model which\nis very limiting it's very disempowering\nit does feel like you might as well get\nto this point and there is no returning\nbecause i've repeated these habits for\nso long and now my body is stuck my\nbrain is stuck and that's just simply\nnot true and all of the very beautiful\njourney and tools that you share\nin this book happy days really are the\nfoundational tools of creating that top\nto bottom transformation yeah because\nthere's there's also in your field the\nbelief that sometimes you have to fully\nremember and recall the whole story or\nyou know be able to talk it all out and\nthat's not true either because and i'm\nliving proof of that you can\nbring the bring the bring the\nstory back to the body you can actually\nattune to\nwhat energetic disturbances need to be\nundone in your nervous system through\nsomatic experiencing through\nemdr through eft\nthrough ifs as well but it doesn't have\nto be a full-blown recall of every\nsingle horrific detail that happened to\nyou as a child and i think that that's\nimportant to say because a lot of people\nmay be\nso like me so so so terrified of what\nthat historical experience might have\nbeen that to even contemplate uncovering\nmore details could be\ntoo\nextreme for their system and then in\nturn block them from actually doing the\ndeeper work\nand so for me i've noticed that\nthat the the body for me really reacted\nto trauma to your point there's a whole\nchapter in the book about the body\nand i i suffered with gastrointestinal\nissues for\ndecades\nand\nwhen i began studying the work of dr\njohn sarno this began to to really shift\nfor me\nand sarno really focused on he wrote the\nbook healing back pain and the mind body\nprescription the the thesis being that\nour physical condition our physical\nsymptoms are psychosomatic and that when\nwe have these unresolved\nexperiences in ifs if we've got exiled\nparts that haven't been tended to\nwe have impermissible rage impermissible\ngrief and permissible shame\nand then we\nbuild up our protectors but some other\nforms of protector parts are physical\nsymptoms\nso we can send that same\nwe can avoid that feeling of rage by\nsending it all to our back\nor we get so living in such a serious\nhyper vigilance that our gut our gut\ngets no you know stops getting blood\nsent to it and it just goes to [ __ ]\nright and so when we have these\nphysical symptoms yes they are indeed\nphysical yes they do often require\nmedical care and i believe in that fully\nand completely\nbut they also require a deeper\nexploration of what are the feelings\nthat live beneath them\nyeah i give a lot of methods in the book\nfor how you can begin to\ntap into and touch into those those\nparts of your body\nthat are trying to reveal something to\nyou as well\ni think it's it's beautiful to the\nacknowledgement that you're offering\nthat this isn't minimizing\nthe pain that many of us are carrying in\nour body i mean for some of us the\nsymptomology of the gastrointestin\nintestinal stuff um that comes as a\nbyproduct whether it's you know ibs or\nfor me it was an extreme form of\nconstipation right that can be very it's\nreal\nperiod and can be very very painful and\nvery limiting and so the way you're very\nbeautifully offering it as an\nopportunity to then also wonder about or\nget curious of if that in and of itself\nis that\nsymptom is coming from something deeper\nwhen you were talking and you said the\nword rage i'm remembering one of the\njournal\nthe journaling techniques that you\nsuggest in your book um which is called\nrage on the page right so the ways that\nwe can begin to create space in our\nworld and for some of us it might be\nthrough the safety of a private\njournaling experience where we are able\nthen to locate and to discharge the\ndeeper feelings how incredibly important\nthat space becomes on our journey\nbecause that deep feeling is just as\nreal as that symptom\nso the goal becomes how can i allow\nspace for both and then to almost\nrelease the valve\non what's fueling\nthe physical symptomology or whatever\nother pattern it is that of running that\ni'm stuck in or that i'm seeing\nyeah and i\ni love you brought up that method\nbecause it's really a sarno method and i\njust added to it but what it is is\nreally giving voice to the impermissible\nso i was having some tmj and i was\ntalking to my friend nicole sax who\npractices a lot of the sarno work and\nshe said well try this method that she\nadapted from sarno and she calls it\njournal speak and she said write for 20\nminutes about whatever you're feeling\nand then follow it with a meditation for\n20 minutes\nand so i did that but then i gabbified\nit because i always just think i'm like\nreally i am an extreme person there's\nextreme parts now that are not so um out\nof control are really helpful and so\ni i added in uh some binaural music and\nso that binaural music it's like the\nemdr music it stimulates the right brain\nand the left brain and\nas i mentioned earlier when you have\nthat bilateral brain stimulation you're\nable to process\nmore of whatever is unresolved and so i\nlistened to the emdr music\nwith just stimula it stimulated a tone\nin the right ear and a tone in the left\near behind the music and that starts to\nstimulate that bilateral brain\nfunctioning\nwhile writing about for 20 minutes\nwhatever i was\nrageful shameful\nangry even slightly disturbed whatever\ngot it onto the page gave it voice\nlist while processing it with this music\nand then follow it with a 20-minute\nmeditation while i'm still listening to\nthe music\nand that's when i can reprocess it\nthat's the reprocessing part that's when\ni can go into a deep meditative state\nand my subconscious can actually start\nto create new neural pathways and say\nwe can do we can we can feel these\nfeelings with a more settled energy or\nwe can see it visually in your mind's\neye\nand i do that every day for 40 minutes\nand it has changed my life\nchanged my life i sleep 10 hours and i'm\ni'm at ease and i know how to i know\nwhere to bring it to bring it all\nso getting it out is extremely important\nbut i also want to just say that rage on\nthe page may sound um too overwhelming\nto someone listening right now\nso you can just you know\njust\nshare on the page as well like may not\nit may not be ready to face into rage so\ni want to really acknowledge that for me\nand i'll just share my own journey in in\nwriting and free associative writing\num being someone who might not likely\nhave been able to even access or admit\nthat i have deep rooted rage or anger\nand i'm really still on that journey of\nallowing in for me all of my spectrum of\nemotions outside of worry and stress\nwhich i've had down my whole life so\nwhen i hear like anger and rage i might\nhave been that person so i appreciate\nthat offering and that suggestion for me\nit began with doing what i think maybe\nmany listeners have been\num introduced to as call and morning\npages yes which is just kind of free\nassociative writing in the morning and\nwhether or not you do the protocol of\nthree full pages maybe some days i did\nmaybe some days i didn't because\neven for me free associative writing\nabout neutral topics was very difficult\ni was not used to allowing myself to be\nin my self energy to be present to what\nwas alive for me or happening because\nvery much like you i was running i was\non my spaceship i was lost in thought i\nwas on my next to-do list check mark and\ni was i didn't ever had that space so\nkind of just to piggyback on that\nsuggestion and to a test that sometimes\nfor some of us writing being in\nself-energy sitting in one minute of\nmeditation to really connect with that\ndeeper space will be difficult at first\nand might even be overwhelming so any\njust neutral writing it's beautiful that\nyou brought up julia cameron and the\nmorning pages because\nwhat she was doing with that practice\nwas helping you clear space for\ncreativity and what is creativity self\nenergy yeah so\nyou know listen god is in all of it it's\nall the work that we've been drawn to\nand that you speak of here and in your\nbook and in my book it's all spiritual\nwork it's all about\nreturning to self returning to god\nwhatever you choose to call it\nand however you need to get there\nand i actually always say like i don't\ncare what you call it i just care that\nyou call upon it\nyep yeah we're actually this brings us\nto the the final foundational piece\nbecause i didn't mention i noted three\nand the third one is again the\nconversation you and i are having now of\nof surrender of surrendering and\nhonoring our deepest feelings our\ndeepest wounding that deep tendency that\nwe have to run to seek safety to claw at\nit whatever way that we can and still\nin real time over time\nlearning how to drop back into that self\nenergy and then to gift ourselves with\nthe opportunity to make new choices from\nthat space and i couldn't agree more\nwith you gabby\ni know sometimes people hearing\nspiritual it's a spiritual journey oh\ncringe spirit is in my opinion essence\nit's the uniqueness that is inside each\nof us that is always there\nmany of us are living in disconnection\nfrom that space because of all of this\ncondition patterning all these parts\nthat are running the show more often\nthan not so that essence\nis alive within each of us and it does\ncontain not only our intuition but like\nyou're very beautifully acknowledging\nnow our creativity i'll go a step\nfurther our ability to be truly present\nand connected to another being to the\ngeneral world the natural world which we\nare part of so ultimately yes this is a\nspiritual journey for all of us because\nreally it's just that journey back into\nthat deeper space of who we are\nyeah\ni i believe that\nyou said what i would refer to as a\nfaith statement when you started talking\nabout what spirit means to you and for\nme it means that there is an\never-present energy of love within us\nand around us that is always guiding us\nand supporting us\nso when we start to\nsurrender to that inner guidance\nwe are led we are led to the right\ntherapist we're led to this podcast\nwe're led to your book we're led to my\nbook we're led to the yoga teacher\nwhoever it might be we're led to the\nmedication whatever it is i speak very\nopenly about that in the book too we're\nled to whatever it is that we need for\nthe next level of our own recovery and\nso\nthat process of surrender really is a\ndaily ritual\nof noticing your fear noticing your\ntrigger noticing\nthe part of you that's activated\nand offering it up saying god self inner\nguide\nhelp me work this out\nand if that doesn't resonate you don't\nget it yet\nwhat i learned in my 12-step program\nthat just was so healing for me was fake\nuntil you make it i've been on my knees\nevery single morning for the past 16\nyears in my recovery and i say take it\nfrom me\ntake it all from me\nand there's a beautiful prayer that has\nbeen a cornerstone in my recovery and\nit's from a course in miracles\nwhere would you have me go what would\nyou have me do what would you have me\nsay\nand to whom\nand that prayer even before i had such a\nstrong faith statement that i have now\nthat that prayer was a string that was\nguiding me to my higher self and to my\nhigher power of my own understanding\nand so just begin with asking for help\ni think what you're also highlighting\nhere and it's\nkind of entering into a really really\ngreat wrap-up of this whole conversation\nwhich is really a testing to\nthe ongoingness the process the\nbeingness of this whole journey every\nday like you just mentioned asking for\nthat guidance every day\nright taking those moments to surrender\nevery day being present to ourselves in\nthe entirety of our parts and our\ncircumstances and our choices and our\ndesires to run and all of the different\nlayers of feelings that we have it's an\neveryday dot dot dot journey and again\ni'm saying this speaking to\nmultiple versions of past self and some\nversions i still entertain now that\nlooks for this done please this final\nbox that i can just put my black marker\nover and\nyou know say it's complete\nand again that even comes from that\ntendency for me for knowing for control\nfor having\na security\nthat's again outside of me and the more\nwe drop that back in the more we\ncultivate that connection we listen to\nthat guidance and then we get that\nguidance affirmed when life does start\nto change in whatever direction we want\nto see it changing in that confidence\nbuilds and then it builds a little bit\nmore and then that\nuncertainty of tomorrow still might feel\nlooming it feels a bit more manageable\nbecause we've rebuilt that connection to\nthat guidance to that self by the\npractice of\ndropping in by the process right of\nbeing on the journey that continues into\nthe infinite future\npeople used to ask me how do i live a\nmiraculous life and i would say well you\nadd up the miracles\nso\nas we\ntap into and tune into all the moments\nof miraculous the moments of oh i\nresponded a little bit differently\nyesterday or i took that tip from nicole\nand it worked we start to create a new\nmore spiritual proof in our body in our\nsystem and our nervous system and our\nbrain that we can change\nand the more we add up those miracle\nmoments\nthe closer we get to living a miraculous\nlife\nand when we live in the miraculous it's\nnot like we don't have problems you know\nbut we can show up for them with a\ntremendous amount of faith and grace\nand that can carry us\nand it's one of the things i admire most\nabout you nicole is\nthat your pursuit to that miraculous\nis we witness it every day on your on\nyour instagram handle and in this\npodcast\nit's it's so fun it's a joyful pursuit\nand you\nput so much\nlove into it and you really have fun\ngoing deeper\nand i think that's a really important\nmessage we started with it and i want to\nclose with it is that the journey while\nit may feel terrifying or treacherous or\nlong or i don't want to do that\nhave fun along the way\nadd up the miracle moments i appreciate\nyou\nyou acknowledging that of me gabby so so\nmuch and i do want to highlight how\nintentional sometimes we have to be even\nwith ourself in those moments of\nacknowledgement it can become so easy to\nforget\nthat you know what the things that i am\ndoing today are quite different than the\nthings i was doing five ten years ago um\nbecause that's now out of mind and all i\ncan see is the distance between what i'm\ndoing or not doing today and what i\nprefer to be doing or not doing into a\nfuture time so there's been so many\nmoments for me not only personally in\nbusiness where it does take the\nconscious intention of we actually had a\nmonth in our circle a couple months ago\ncalled celebrate you which the focus was\non that how purposeful we have to be\nabout acknowledging\nthose moments of change because most of\nus do just look right on to the next or\ndo see what we didn't do as opposed to\nwhat we did in that moment and taking\nthose moments to celebrate\nto acknowledge your way on the journey\nis is so incredibly impactful and\npowering and it's affirmatory it's like\noh okay right this is what's gonna help\ncontinue me walking forward even as it\nremains difficult in moments even after\ni backslide or whatever we want to call\nit i have that old reaction i do that\nold habit i do that old thing\nthat i want to avoid\nthese will be the moments that you can\ncall upon to say you know i did do that\nold thing and now i have just another\nopportunity just like i did many months\nbefore to do something new and yeah in\nmy opinion it's building those moments\nin two of acknowledgement of celebration\nespecially if again coming full circle\nyou do have as many of us do that core\ni'm not worthy that's going to be the\nfirst narrative that's going to be\noffered to your subconscious so when i\nsay being intentional that's what that\nmeans in practice stopping that and\nsaying okay thank you old narrative that\nkept me safe in this moment i am worthy\nbecause this is what i did differently\nand being compassionate towards\nso\noh there you are again\nvoice of unworthiness and i understand\nthat you would be here right now because\nyou're trying to protect me from feeling\nsomething\nand i have a lot of love and compassion\ntowards you but i'm going to choose\nagain\nand i'd love to see things differently\ni'd love to\ntake a walk with myself right now i'm\ngoing to open that book again i'm going\nto go listen to nicole\nand giving yourself the chance to start\nwith that compassion because\ncompassion is the antidote to\nunworthiness\nwhat a beautiful line compassion is the\nantidote to unworthiness i am gonna take\nthat one with me\num thank you gabby for all of your time\nyour energy your wisdom before we end\ntell us a little bit about\nwhen the book officially comes out when\nand how we can get our hands on it talk\nto me about happy days\nbooks out on 2 22 22.\nif you're hearing this before the 26th\nof february\nyou can get
