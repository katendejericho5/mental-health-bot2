    "transcript": "hello hello hello\ngood morning good afternoon good evening\ncommunity\nwe're getting ready to talk about dr\nellen's new book\nthe anatomy of anxiety and i know\nprobably for a lot of you as someone\nmyself who has struggled with anxiety\nfor as long as i can remember\nthe wisdom and the practical tools that\ndr ellen is shares not only\non her instagram account and all the\nsocial media that she puts out each and\nevery day which is how i crossed her\npath\nbut incredible incredible wisdom in this\nnew book\nso i'm gonna go ahead and extend an\ninvite to her but first really quickly\nwho is dr ellen\ndr ellen vora is a holistic psychiatrist\nacupuncturist and yoga teacher\nshe takes a functional medicine approach\nto mental health so totally resonate\nwith that myself\nconsidering the whole person and\naddressing\nimbalances at the root which is the root\ncause for a lot of what most of us\nstruggle with in particularly anxiety\nhello barry so nice of you to join us\nhere today\ndr ellen\nvora received her ba from yale\nuniversity and her md from columbia\nuniversity and she is board certified in\npsychiatry and integrative holistic\nmedicine and today she's going to be\njoining me in but a second to discuss\nher new book the anatomy of anxiety\nunderstanding and overcoming the body's\nfear\nresponse so there she is well that was\nseamless\nhi nickel it's never seamless\nwell it's not i tried to do my first\nquick aside tick tock the other night\nand talk about not seamless i'm so used\nto the instagram format of it so maybe\nthis just surprised me here you are\nhi\nthanks for having me here of course i am\nsuper super excited um and i'm imagining\neveryone here that's joining us live i\nknow anxiety is\nkind of one of those things that if\nyou're human at some point along your\njourney i mean i know for me as long as\ni can remember i very much resonated\nwith that experience of\nanxiety though i know for a lot of us\nwe've had those points in our life\nwhether or not it was a lifetime of\nanxiety as i know a lot of us carry with\nus or just those moments where things\nfeel you know really really anxious all\nof the time so i'm super excited to\nhear from you and first and foremost why\nanxiety um what kind of made you or\ncompelled you i know all of the\ndifferent type of work you do why is it\nthat a booklet anxiety is you're\noffering to the world yeah it was really\ntwo factors one was that i\ndidn't fail to notice the pattern which\nwas that every single person coming into\nmy office\nwas reporting anxiety you know it might\nhave been anxiety plus something else\nbut that was a pretty common theme so i\nsaw the scale of this problem and the\nneed and then the other thing which is a\nlittle weird is that um when it comes to\nthe full array of all the different\ndiagnoses that we treat in the mental\nhealth capacity in certain ways when\nsomeone comes in they say like my chief\ncomplaint is anxiety\ni'm a little bit like\nnot excited but like chomping at the bit\nto get started because with anxiety i\nfeel like there's so much low-hanging\nfruit and there's so many ways to\nrelieve suffering quickly and upfront\nand that's not always the case you know\nwhen someone comes in with something\nelse a heavier duty diagnosis i sort of\nlike roll up my sleeves and like okay\nwe're going to really get to work here\nanxiety i feel like we could have a\nconsultation i could send someone home\nwith a few actionable strategies and\nthey can feel better right away not a\nhundred percent but we can make some\nincremental progress\nthat's incredible news and i'm sure a\nlot of\neveryone all the listeners out there\nmight be feeling a little bit of hope\nbecause i know for those of us who've\nhad anxiety and definitely have\nexperienced the panic attack version i'm\ngoing to get out to speak for my my own\nexperience hopelessness really feeling\nout of control feeling like there's\nactually nothing you can do to to create\nchange or to learn to live with it or\neven to allow our anxiety or panic to\nfeel a little more manageable so hearing\nyou know that there are actually things\nand here you describe it as low-hanging\nfruit so tell me what you mean about\nthat i know you offer um two types more\nor less of anxiety is one of the main\nmessages in your book so can you first\nshare a little bit about what you mean\nabout false versus true and and isn't\nanxiety just anxiety or what are these\ntwo different types\nso yeah that's the central thesis of the\nbook and the part that i really hope\npeople take away so they can look at\nanxiety differently and feel a little\nbit more hopeful more capable of making\na difference in how they feel the idea\nis that rather than what we were taught\nin the you know in our training in the\ndsm that bible of mental health\ndiagnostic statistical manual i don't\nknow if you've burned yours by now i\ni think mine is you know holding\nsomething up somewhere\ncollecting dust so\nall of those ways of classifying anxiety\ni didn't feel that that was meaningfully\nsteering management in my practice\nbecause the idea behind it like is\nsomething panic disorder with or without\nagoraphobia is it generalized anxiety\ndisorder the idea is to point management\nand say well what's indicated here\nmedication or cognitive behavioral\ntherapy but those aren't my first line\ntools to begin with so a more useful\nclassification system that i just\nstarted to observe was dividing anxiety\ninto two types false anxiety which is\nthe avoidable anxiety and true anxiety\nwhich is purposeful anxiety\nand i want a caveat i recognize that\ncalling it false anxiety\nfeels you know that we can perceive that\nas somewhat invalidating and i want to\nmake it really clear that it's in no way\nshape or form intended to invalidate the\nvery real suffering in false anxiety it\njust speaks to the fact that there's a\nphysical basis and there's a\nstraightforward path out\nand it's not here yeah go ahead\nno condition\nit's just not here as like our deep\ntruth it is unnecessary suffering that's\nnot ultimately serving us\nright i think what i'm hearing and i\nreally appreciate that that clarity so\nyou know for everyone listening the\nsymptoms that we're having whether or\nnot it's coming from false or true\nanxiety are real you are feeling your\nheart beat out of your chest you might\nbe shaking i know for me i started to\nfaint um as kind of an extreme shut down\nresponse of a very overactive nervous\nsystem for me so again i'm really happy\nellen that you offered that\nclarification so that's real that's\nhappening in my body my heart is\npounding out of my chest i whatever it\nis that's happening is a very real thing\num however i think what i'm hearing you\nsay is what's driving it\nagain also very real um but before we\nget to the low-hanging fruit of what i'm\nimagining you're going to say this false\nanxiety what are some of those deeper\ncauses that we can begin to create\nactionable change around what is the\ngood anxiety why do we why do we need it\nwhat is that there for\nyeah so i mean that one i get uh pretty\ndeep and philosophical about but the\nidea here is that you know part of this\nis just what it is to be alive in a\nhuman body and the immense vulnerability\nthat comes with that so much of anxiety\ncenters around certainty control\ncatastrophizing and really anticipating\nworst case scenario outcomes which if\nwe're really if we keep peeling back the\nlayers and boiling that down in certain\nways it's\ndying and it's losing the people we love\nand i would add\nsuffering anticipation of suffering is\nalso a category and\nthat's\nyou know that's just what it is to be in\na physical body and we can't correct\nthat neither with holistic approaches or\nmedication nothing touches that um i do\nthink that within true anxiety there's a\nwhole section in my book about kind of\nseeking\nand exploring the questions of\nwell is there something beyond what\nmeets the eye happening here does that\nsoften the edges around the ultimate\nworst case scenario does it make loss\nfeel on some level less absolute but i\nthink that true anxiety is also\npurposeful\nit is this inner compass\nnudging us tapping on our shoulder and\nit's saying\nhey\nslow down\nsomething is not okay\nin your personal life in your community\nin the world at large\nand\nyou know we we tell people stop being so\nsensitive but the people that viscerally\nconnect to the suffering that's\nhappening in their communities in the\nworld\nlike this is not these are not the\npeople we should be telling to change\nright this is a gift it's the most\nessentially human pro-social empathetic\ncapacity\nand it's also i think here in a sort of\nprophetic role\nlike when people have a lot of true\nanxiety they are sensing how we have got\nastray\nas a culture as a species\nand\nso that anxiety it's not something to\npathologize\nit's not something that we could gluten\nfree or decaf coffee our way out of\nit's a true north and it's here to tell\nus like slow down listen to this and\ntake steps\nconvert that anxiety into purposeful\naction\nand then it doesn't feel like we're just\nwallowing in a helpless feeling of\nanxiety overwhelm it then we transmute\nthat feeling into one of purpose\nso i think what i'm hearing and i use\nthis term a lot so\nmembers of the community will be\nfamiliar with this it's a signal right\nand we we need that signal and even just\nthe kind of existential basis i know\nprobably people have heard that term\nbeing used and again i can i can\nremember back to early aspects of my\nanxiety where that was actually the fear\ni would lie in bed\nwith\nkind of contemplating two things either\njust this idea of death\nand i kind of describe it as it would\njust it would almost overwhelm i\ncouldn't even summon the feeling my mind\nmy very you know young mind of thinking\nthis about this idea for me it was of\ninfinity infinity of time never ending\nand it just was like conceptually\na lot for me and then i had that\ncompounded by because in my in my family\nhome with my mom who was suffering from\nchronic health issues and my sister as\nwell who had a couple moments in life\nwhere there were severe um things\nhappening for her and her life was\nactually you know at risk even before i\nwas born so now i had this very real\napplicable fear of death through illness\nin my home so i can remember back to\nlike i said being a child and kind of\nmusing over whether it was oh my god\ndeath and dying and ending loss i think\nthat's what we're really kind of uh in\nconflict around when we're in a human\nbody this idea of separation and that\ncould end and people i love could not be\nhere anymore and that's a big feeling\nand then again those of us who have had\nvery real risks or very real fears of\nrisk of death or health-related concerns\num i think a lot of times life death\nloss all gets wrapped up into this\nexperience of anxiety for a lot of us\noh what you're saying right now can i\nsort of just do a little thinking out\nabout it because it's bringing up a lot\nof things these are not like well-worn\nideas for me kind of half-baked concepts\nbut i think that i don't know a lot\nabout like your family of origin what\nyou've been through i've read your book\nyou know i have i understand snippets\nbut i think that\nespecially as a parent\nthere's this really tricky balance to\nstrike around like\nwhen you have a child it's like people\ndescribe it as your heart is walking\naround outside of your body it's like\nthe most important shoe in the world is\nso vulnerably just like out in the world\nthis unsafe world\nand\nand i think that you know if your sister\nis older and said this happened even\nbefore you were born so i just think\nabout like and this is some of the\nbeauty of your work is that to\nunderstand\nall these things that give us our nooks\nand crannies and make us up and and then\nyou know even when it's our caretakers\nour parents and how their behavior\nshaped us but then what they went\nthrough shaped their behaviors and you\ncan imagine if your mom went through\nfear around losing a child\nthen when you come along she doesn't get\nto give you that longer leash that helps\nus\ngrow\nyou know that anti-fragile understanding\nof ourselves resilience where we feel\ncapable because we have a parent who for\ngood reason has been traumatized by the\nfear of losing a child and so then\nthere's a kind of\nextra grasping and clinging\nand\nit's just it's super understandable and\nit's also tough on the kid all at the\nsame time\nyeah what you're bringing up i think\nwhat's what i love to hear here and i\nknow a lot of your work that you shared\nand in this book in particular is about\njust that that we're resilient because\nwhat we're talking about here\nis extending our capacity or expanding\nour capacity to be able to to do just\nthat whether or not we're of course\ndiving into the deep end of this\nexistential very normal human anxiety\nthat we're talking about here just\ngeneral stress of life right and i i\njust want to clarify that because\nsometimes you know i think some of us\nare of the belief the incorrect belief\nand the unhelpful belief because it sets\nup an expectation that's not attainable\nthat life is meant to be anxiety free\nand and speak to even this whole concept\nof you know kind of true anxiety that's\njust simply not not the case right and\nthat's what resilience means it's how\ncan i\nlearn how to tolerate little bits more\nof things that were stressful again and\noftentimes in childhood to speak to your\npoint i didn't have the attuned\ncaregiver because my caregivers were so\ndistracted in their own survival mode\nright dealing with their own the fire\nthat was very real right there for them\nthat it was of no ill intent they very\nmuch wanted to show up in a loving\nsupportive way for me to the extent that\nand i think a lot of caregivers out\nthere aren't even maybe aware\nof of our survival mode and of the\nimpact that that has on the loved ones\naround us so without having you know a\nmother just like you actually offered\nfor me right now right\nstanding next to me as little nicole and\nexplaining to me right this is a big\nfeeling you know this idea of death and\nloss and it's a lot to wrap our head\naround and to even just sit down next to\nme on the couch and explain to me that\nwhat i was feeling was normal in that\nmoment um for a lot of us who didn't\nhave that we're left to make sense of it\non our own and usually we end up feeling\ncompletely overwhelmed we can't make\nsense of it and then we figure out a way\nto continue to carry on life um and what\nthat looks like for a lot of us is\ncontinuing\nto live in a dysregulated nervous system\ncontinuing to maybe make choices that\naren't helping our body\nto go back in alignment and i even see\nso let's shift a little bit and kind of\ndistinguish true anxiety from from false\nanxiety because again these choices that\nwe're making that i definitely know\nmy caregivers were making my family as a\nsystem was making to put it bluntly\nwasn't helping things was keeping us\nlocked again with inflammation in our\nbodies unable to really balance our\nnervous system and not able to actually\nbreak out of those points of activation\nso so what is this false anxiety and how\ndo we know the difference and what is\ncausing some of\nwhat we would call false anxiety yeah\ngod i'm gonna have a hard time staying\nfocused on that single question because\nyou brought up so much and my synapses\nare fired\nyeah i mean i think i love where you\nwant to go\nlet's see if i'll keep to it but there's\njust one snippet of what you just said\nwhich is also for anybody who's parent\nin listening or who anybody who is just\nholding space for somebody else\ntherapist a friend\ni think people often feel like what am i\nsupposed to do what's the right way to\nshow up what are the right questions to\nask the right things to say\nand it turns out there's nothing fancy\nor high-tech about how to attune to\npeople it's in many ways it's extremely\nlow-tech it's ubu\nand you show up\nand you sit by somebody and you ask some\nopen-ended questions and then you convey\nwith your body language like that wasn't\na perfunctory question i really mean it\nlike you know how are you feeling about\nthis thing that's happening\nand i'm available to really sit with it\nand i think that we all have that power\nin that capacity to\nto attune to the people in our lives to\nour children to our friends in that way\nand it's powerful medicine we can be\ngiving for each other\nto your question um false anxiety\nlike so life is stressful and that's\ninevitable and i i always like to talk\nabout and cover ways that we can\ndischarge that stress we can cultivate\nthe relaxation response but false\nanxiety really speaks to the fact that a\nlot of the stressors in our body are not\njust from external events\nthey're precipitated by something\nphysical usually a state of physiologic\nimbalance that trips us into a stress\nresponse and that's the part that's\nunnecessary and it's happening so much\nin modern life not because we're doing\nanything wrong but because modern life\nhas built up all of these default\nsettings that have us eat in a certain\nway and drink certain beverages and\ninteract with our phones in our bed\nall of these things that are really\nmessing with our physiology and we're\nkind of jacked up and we're just\nbouncing like a pinball machine between\ndifferent unnecessary stress responses\nand it's creating a lot of what we\nexperience as anxiety and that's the\nunnecessary part and i'll add that\nwe\nlike we make meaning of that physical\nsensation because that's what our brains\ndo they're meaning makers like if you\nput a piece of paper and had two dots\nand a line like i know what that is\nthat's a face\nand if we you know skip breakfast and\nhave a um you know strong iced coffee\nand then some candy and nachos for\ndinner and we do scroll we're in a\nstress response and our brain says oh i\nknow why i'm stressed it's because of\nthis thing going on at work and this\ninterpersonal dynamic that feels uneasy\nand it'll swoop in with a narrative\nit'll tell us a story about why we're\nstressed and we never have any shortage\nof things to be stressed about\nbut\nif we could really omnisciently look\nunder the hood in that moment and know\nwhat was going on the reason we're\nstressed and anxious in that moment was\nsomething physical and actually\navoidable\nso the false anxieties it's things like\nblood sugar crashes that's a big one\nit's sleep deprivation it's being\ninflamed anything wrong going on with\nour digestive tract micronutrient\ndeficiencies\num\ni think about like everything going on\nwith screens what it makes us do to our\nneck musculature to our jaw to our eye\nposition so many ways it kind of creates\nsort of physical false anxiety\num\nthere's a lot that goes on with hormones\nthese days in modern life that also\nrelates to false anxiety the list goes\non and on it's basically to say there's\na lot we can do to at least chip away at\nthe unnecessary anxiety leaving us a\nlittle bit more resilient and calm and\nclear\nas we go to face the true anxiety that's\nso meaningful\nin how we show up in service in this\nworld\ni think what you're describing really\nbeautifully and the reason why you know\nyou are a holistic\npsychiatrist is you're really\nhighlighting\nthat communication between if we really\nwant to simplify it our mind\nand our body\nand they are in communication for a very\nlong time we just thought our mind held\nall the power and yes and even in my\nbook i talk about the power of thought\nand it can be really helpful um of\ncourse if we're thinking empowering\nthoughts just as much as thinking not\nempowering thoughts can be really\ndifficult however and to speak to a\npoint you made earlier about cbt not\nreally doing it um for anxiety and\nreally being in alignment for the\ntreatment of it even though for a very\nlong time even would still be the gold\nstandard in how we're taught to handle\nany of the spectrum of anxiety our mind\nis powerful however so is our body so\njust as much as our mind as we say top\ndown sending all these messages our body\nis sending just as many messages\nup to our mind and i would have this\nexperience and i share this story a lot\nbecause in in my intention in my essence\nwhatever we want to call it that makes\nme me i like to joke and say i'm a\nhippie at heart\nall i want to do is like peace size\npeace and love and chill like that's\nwhat i'm about like if i really kind of\npeel back all my layers however i\ncouldn't i couldn't understand why\nright if i had a hippie moment say for\ninstance i was having a moment alone or\na nice peaceful sunday and i just could\nchill the thing i've always wanted to do\ni kept finding myself whether i was\nalone or with someone else unable to\njust embody that peace unable to be\nstress-free unable to relax no matter\nhow much i try to remind myself that\nnicole there's nothing happening here\ntoday\njust like you described my very anxious\nbody because of all of for me the\ninflammation all of the messages that my\nnervous system my body were sending to\nmy mind before long\ni would become either racing with all\nthe reasons why i can't be giving myself\nthis day of rest or i'd actually have\nagitated something usually my\nrelationship if someone was present to\nme\nwith you know an irritant oh that look\nyou gave me this morning or oh you\ndidn't clean up the dishes and now i\ncan't have my stressful day so now i'm\ngonna rail on my partner and before long\ni'm back in my stressful moment and i\ncouldn't understand\nwhy for some time i thought it was\nbecause well genetically\ni have anxiety so someone who has\nanxiety never can rest that's just my\nlot in life what i came to understand\nwas what we're describing here was that\nno my body was having so much anxiety\nthat it was sending those signals to my\nmind and it was only a matter of time\nbefore my mind was off to the races or\nbefore\nyou know i was then creating something\nstressful to deal with and when we're\ntalking about a human body just going\nback in time we were our first\nenvironment right when we're talking\nabout like the impact that we carry that\nbegan\ninside of another human being meaning\nwhat is their physiology like how\nregulated and safe is their nervous\nsystem what are they eating how much are\nthey sleeping\ni love like how much are they\ninteracting with their bed or what is\ntheir relationship with peace and calm\nin their life and just to kind of\ncomplete my story for me\nlike you shared earlier very intuitive\nintuitively my mom had a lot of anxiety\nand being a mother who was pregnant\nlater in life she was 42 when she even\nfound out she was pregnant at first she\nthought she was sick because she started\nhaving the symptomology of a pregnancy\nand her first thought and this is so i\nactually came to learn this at her\nfuneral when it was a story told in\nlevity and jokes and it is a joking\nstory however i understand the truth of\nit now her first thought was i might\nhave stomach cancer that's that's\nclearly what's wrong with me because i'm\nnot pregnant i'm 42 years old so what's\nwrong with me must be something health\nrelated only to find out and of course\nshe was very happy that she was pregnant\nand then there was concerns about how i\nwould develop given her late in life but\nsharing that to describe thinking back\nto the mother right that we were born\ninto\nwhat was that environment like and how\nmuch of an impact did that have on us\nand then of course we're born into an\nenvironment where there are choices that\nwe're taught there are family structures\naround eating sleeping right all of\nwhich we don't really have to say about\ndefinitely not when we're an infant and\nagain all of which might be contributing\nto these deeper\ncauses for this false anxiety that then\nwe're saddled with for life\nyes well okay yes and\nso we're we're so imprinted by these\nearly life experiences even what we\nexperienced in the bloom even what we\nexperienced when our mom was a fetus in\nour maternal grandmother's womb it all\nin princess because the female fetus\nalready has um everything that will go\non to become her eggs that become her\noffspring while she's a fetus in her\nmother's womb so it's it's really deep\nand this is i think in many ways a\nbiologic basis for you know just how we\ncarry the trauma from past generations\nand we're plastic\nand i'm just you know eternally\nirritatingly hopeful and optimistic that\num there are things we can do and that's\nsuch a delicate balance because\ni'm really interested in people being\nhopeful\nwhile not um\nsort of\nwithout it seeming like blame and shame\nand judgment and that's a tricky line to\ntoe\nbecause you know what we've been\nindoctrinated with is this idea that\nmental health\nis a genetically determined chemical\nimbalance in the brain\nand that came as a relief originally you\nknow as a reaction to\nlike oh it's a moral failing you know\nand so to make it a disease model and to\nmake it objective and it's not your\nfault it's your genes was a beautiful\nimprovement upon like there's something\njust wrong with you you're just not a\ngood person and that's why you're\nsuffering in this way\nthanks fortunately this idea is done\nbut um in some ways it it conveys to us\nthis idea that it's our genetic destiny\nand that there's no way around it\nand i think that on some levels that's\nsort of comforting because it's like\nwell there's nothing i can do so i don't\nneed to roll up my sleeves and get to\nwork but it's also sort of discouraging\nand we feel stuck\nand and i also just think it's\ninaccurate and so what's really true is\nthat absolutely there's such a thing as\na genetic predisposition there's also an\nepigenetic predisposition if our\nmaternal grandmother was disenfranchised\nin her life going through stress and\ntrauma that impacts genetically our moms\nit impacts us\nbut also\neven though we have the genetic and the\nepigenetic predisposition\nit's a small piece of the overall puzzle\nand the environment which includes\neverything\nhow we manage stress how we sleep\nwhether we're getting sunshine whether\nwe have community in our lives\nconnection to nature\nmusic pleasure\nall of these things are also\nvery real determinants of our mental\nhealth\nand that's the part we can control\nand i don't say that as like if you're\nnot already doing all these things like\nthe meme like i'm taking a stupid walk\nfor my stupid mental health right it's\nnot like if you're not already doing\nthese things then your mental health\nissues are your fault it's not that it's\nmore like hey modern life has made it\nreally conducive for our environment to\nmanifest our genetic predisposition for\nmental health issues but let's\nlook a little closer let's get strategic\nand make some changes\nthat can help us feel better\nand they're not\nlocked away or gatekeeped by an ivory\ntower of medicine and that's what's so\nbeautiful about the work you do the idea\nof self-healers\nlike these are things that we can access\nin our own lives for free they're\nnon-invasive they're safe\nit's it's really the fundamentals\nthey're not patented they're not\nyou know no one's gonna sell these to us\nbut we can access them and it's about\nprioritizing communities prioritizing\nsleep doing some breath work making sure\nwe connect to nature making sure we have\npleasure\nrelationship to music and dancing\nand\nnourishing our bodies from a place of\nradical self-love um which is its own\nlonger conversation\nand i think that you know i would argue\nalso giving ourselves permission to\nwell first of all cry a lot more and we\ncan talk about that um but also to seek\nand to find what feels true for us\nin terms of\npurpose or making meaning of what it is\nto be alive we don't have to arrive at\nan answer but i think there's something\nsomewhat of a salve for anxiety even\njust living those questions\ni appreciate you you offering that\nbecause um so much of\nmy\npast journey and what led me to really\nhit pivot and begin to first wonder why\nthe traditional way i was thinking and\nworking not only with my clients at the\ntime but myself through my own anxiety\nhaving tried all different types of\nindividual group all different types of\nmodality you know in treatment\num i was finding myself really\ndisempowered would be stuck the number\none word i heard from my clients because\ni had all of the tools and all of this\nawareness yet in real time i couldn't\nseem to and because i was missing big\npieces of it i wasn't fully\nunderstanding my nervous system at that\ntime and until i did i wasn't able to\nlike we're talking about really get my\nbody on board to help me then to be able\nto in those moments be able to implement\nchanges i didn't realize how\ndysregulated my body was and how\ndysregulating a lot of the choices that\ni was making in my very modern life so\nto speak to your point i mean i know you\nlive in new york city i spent almost a\ndecade there my life in\nmy 20s\na lot of us are living in environments\nthat that are challenging the amount of\nnoise the amount of people um that we're\nexposed to daily our sleep habits the\ntechnology that people that most of us\nlive within our pockets that we go to\nbed with even at night\nall of these when we think about as i do\noften our natural state kind of putting\nus back on the planes um you know in our\nin our earliest groups or plans like how\ndid humans evolve i mean for most of us\nat least and i'm sure many of you on the\nlive that's not what life looks like for\nyou when you look outside of the window\nthat you might not even have access to\nin the room that you're in i mean i've\nbeen in new york city apartments where\nsome rooms didn't have windows right so\ntalk about\nthe choices that we make each day and if\nyou were to kind of give we talked a\nlittle bit about technology about sleep\nabout um community about nutrition\nwhat would you suggest is kind of the\nlowest hanging fruit that for those who\nare this is completely new information\nand you know it might feel overwhelming\nto have a list of five new things to\nstart to do tomorrow\nwhat would you suggest would be the most\nfoundational place to get curious about\nor to begin and what change can we go\nfrom there yes thank you for keeping us\non track and having some actionable\ntakeaways so here we go we're\nsimplifying this as much as possible\num i think one of the most impactful\nchanges that we can all make is actually\nto just have a boundary around not\nbringing the phone into the bedroom at\nnight not surprised you were going to go\nthere so but talk about this phone\nbecause i've been exploring and noticing\nall of the different ways\nphones affected me um phones are very\nreal part of our life so assuming\nthey're going to continue to be a real\npart of our life yeah they can still be\na part of our life um but that's the\nsacred boundary is basically what you do\nis you set up your charger somewhere\nelse if you're concerned about you know\nmissing important calls overnight you\ncan let the charger be just outside your\nbedroom door you know it can still be an\near shot\nbut not on your bedside table not a\nclutch to your chest while you sleep\nbecause the fact of the matter is if\nit's there it's the last thing we look\nat before beds first thing we look at we\nwake up we glance at it at 2 a.m when we\nwake up to pee\nand that's destructive to our mental\nhealth in a number of different ways\none is simply the blue spectrum light\nthat it emits\nthat's disrupting our circadian rhythm\nso it's basically sending this really\nconfusing message to our brain saying\nthe sun is rising good morning suppress\nmelatonin release cortisol even if it's\nfour in the morning\nand so light is so critical to\nregulating our sleep wake cycle and the\nphone is a really strong signal of light\ninto our eyes up to our brain so that\nalone is a factor there's also the fact\nthat we're in the attention economy\nsmart companies know their behavioral\npsychology and their neuroscience and\nthey know that if there's no natural\nstopping point we will scroll forever no\none has ever said look i got to the end\nof tick tock now let me put my phone to\nthe side and yeah wholesome bedtime\ncheck yeah finish tick tock for today\nand then there's like there's also the\nfact that you know they know to um the\nalgorithm is conducive to fear\nuncertainty doubt controversy this is\nwhat makes us rubberneck we give an\nincreasingly large share of our\nattention they win they get more ad\nrevenue more clicks more of our\nattention but our mental health and our\nsleep are the collateral damage\nso even just having that boundary around\nthe phone in terms of whether or not it\ncomes in with you to the bedroom that\nmakes a huge impact on our sleep quality\nand our overall well-being because sleep\nis one of the most important medicines\nfor every single mental health issue\nso that's number one\num basically you could go with sleep\nreally quickly i think so it's one of\nthose areas too where it's it's quite\noverlooked i think for a lot of us um i\ndon't think we were as realistic with\nourselves about how much time\nwe're getting in the bedroom and if we\nare in the bedroom i don't think we're\nspeak to your point spending that time\non\nallowing our body to calm to go into a\nsleep mode and as i used to tell my\nclients all the time sleep the process\nof sleep begins before you close that\nbedroom door and put your head on that\npillow and to speak to your point those\nof us who are scrolling or bringing\nphones into the bedroom we're not we're\nnot cueing our body and that it's it's\ntime to sleep so once even we put our\nphone down right now our body needs to\nsettle and so we might be spending more\nhours in time trying to sleep than we\nare actually at successfully sleeping\nand so for me just to share quickly my\nphone and putting up that sacred\nboundary was foundational um for my\nrelationship with my body anxiety and\nsleep in particular because\nhistorically i wouldn't go to bed\nwithout my phone next to me in case\nsomething happened at home i was always\nwaiting for that call that was going to\ntell me that that final shoot so all of\nthis is so interconnected to anxiety so\nmy first boundary was how can i go to\nsleep and what i what i would\nrest myself assured with was\nmost of the time i was living far from\nthe people who would be having the\nemergency so my mindset was if i got the\ncall at 3am versus 6am when my eyes\nopened right what real difference there\nthe emergency will still be there in the\nmorning and i'll tend to it once i've\ngotten a more complete night of sleep so\nthat was the first assurement i kind of\nstepped out of the bedroom for my phone\nand that was really helpful because i\nwould i would look i would look anytime\ni woke up i not only see what time it\nwas make sure no one texted me and if\nsomeone was on the other end now i open\nmyself up to whatever reaction i might\nhave based on whatever it is that i i\nsaw and then the next\nboundary that i'm always negotiating\nwith my phone is those of us who are put\nour phone away when do we choose to pick\nit up because for me i got very savvy at\nknowing that my phone can be my stressor\nwhen i'm having that moment like we're\ntalking about earlier my body is\nactivated and i want to know why i know\nexactly which pages that are going to\npiss me off and i will go there and i'll\ntalk about doom scrolling and i'll do\nsome doom scrolling and i'll firm that i\nfeel the way i do for this particular\nreason\nand a lot of us do that so really\ngetting conscious around what is our\nfull relationship with our phone in\nterms of stress in terms of sleep and\nrelaxation\nand how can we hold ourselves\naccountable more or less and i'm still\nfinding ways that i need to hold myself\naccountable to what i'm doing on my\nphone because everything is available on\nour phones\nat any time\nyou brought up so much i hope you have\ntime because we gotta just touch on this\nbriefly i think one thing is like yes so\nif you are sort of waiting for that\nemergency call overnight um i too i find\nthat people fall into two different\ncategories one is if they know they\nmight get the call at any moment they\ncan't fall asleep so then it's actually\nabout putting the boundary recognizing\n6am would be early enough to handle it\nand other people if they know that they\nthat the ear is the phone is sort of out\nof earshot then they can't sleep and so\nfor them it's like set up the charger a\nlittle further away from the bed\nmake sure your settings are adjusted so\nthat a call from favorites or a double\ncall will break through the do not\ndisturb function and you can kind of\nrest assured that if in the event of an\nemergency you're going to hear the call\nand have your people know don't just\ntext an emergency which people typically\nwouldn't do\nand i think that the reason we sort of\nself sabotage and look at the pages that\nwe know will gin up our stress response\nit connects back to the way we're\nhardwired for community\nand\nthis is just it like on the proverbial\nsavannah of evolution\nhuman beings we were never\nthe strongest we were never the fastest\nwe were simply the ones who figured out\nhow to cooperate most effectively and\nthat's why we've survived and\nthis is why it's deep in our dna that we\nfeel safe when we feel held in community\nand if something is awry in our\nrelationships that's very distressing\nand\nif on the proverbial savannah it's a\nmatter of life or death in modern life\nit's different than that and i think\nthat you know places like social media\nthis is where\nyou're never going to\num have a shortage of people that\ndisagree or\nmisunderstand you or you know like it's\na place where we come without full\naccountability and we you know hurt\nwe're hurt people hurting people we're\nbringing all of our own\nstress and tension from our lives and\nkind of dumping it all over and i think\nthat\nwe can really fixate on that i know i do\nand it's like you can\nyou know it's a it's a weird it feels\nsort of like this self-destructive\npractice to be like these comments are\nreally messing up my nervous system why\ndo i continue to read them you know and\ni'll tell myself i'm looking for that\npearl of something useful here i'm\nlooking for the feedback that helps me\ngrow and change it's a little bit true\nbut i think it is also the way we'll\nobsess over am i okay am i liked by\nthe tribe um the community on the\nsavannah and if i'm not i better figure\nthat out otherwise i'm going to be\nostracized and\nalone\nyou know just me against the leopards\nand i think that that is why it feels\nlike something we really need to hone in\non but i think it's it's tough because\nwe're in the modern world where it isn't\nquite so life or death and we can\nsurround ourselves\nwith the people that\ncall us in but are ultimately rooting\nfor us to grow and change\ni got chills when you talked about you\nknow kind of our\nour evolution in terms of cooperation\nand those of you listening might have\nheard you know humans refer to as we're\nwired to connect we're an interpersonal\nspecies all of that really does kind of\nis is capitalizing or is it highlighting\nyou know that that that power that we\nhave because that is a power the ability\nto care enough and all this kind of goes\nback to what we were talking about\nearlier anxiety as a signal right us\nusing our bodies to sense danger and to\nkeep those of us that we are loved and\nsupported by and that are the most\nmeaningful us because of their\nconnection to our literal survival safe\nalong with us we aren't you know humans\non an island at all we need those groups\nof people and i think what you're\nbringing up is another layer\nof i call it learning we're in a\nlearning stage of humanity a lot of ways\nnow because this is the first time and i\nwas on i was speaking to someone\nrecently and we were talking about how\nin a lot of ways this is this i mean\neven when you and i connected on social\nmedia right this is the first time that\nwe are humans now in this global\ncommunity that is whatever the platform\nis that you're using where we have\naccess to other humans from around the\nworld and this is\nnew to say the least we didn't have that\nunless you lived in my little\nneighborhood i wouldn't really i might\nnot even know about your type of person\nbecause i wouldn't have been exposed to\nit and now every day at the click of a\nbutton\nright we have the ability to connect to\nsee\nyou know\naspects of us and our experience in\nsomeone else and to also see differences\nthat abound in this global collective so\ni think as as comforting as that can be\nand one of the main\nreasons i went online as a psychologist\nat the time he was told never to be a\nhuman right never to create a profile\nwhere you're just nicole and you're\nsharing god forbid about your personal\nlife so a lot of us in the field were\neven taught not to water down the\nindividual side of us\nand seeing that this was an opportunity\nto be an individual it still wasn't a\nnew space so now we all have these\nplatforms of individual self-expression\ninteracting with all other very diverse\nindividuals from around the world so\nwhile and i tend to be like you i tend\nto look at you know the hope of it\nbecause for me that gave me the\nopportunity to connect with people like\nyourself and people in the community who\nwere living a similar enough journey\nthat it felt relatable that then began\nbecame my community of people with whom\nto begin to build these deeper more\nauthentic relationships so that's the\nhopeful side of it but of course there's\nall of the challenge that that comes\nalong with i think navigating this\nglobal collective that we're evolving\ninto ah it's such a both and because\nit's a beautiful thing that like if\nyou're kind of a weirdo you know like\ni'm different than the people i went to\nmedical school with the people i train\nin psychiatry with i see things\ndifferently and that can be lonely and\nthen the interwebs allows us to find our\ncommunity and be like you see this the\nsame way as i do and that's like\nit's so grounding it's such a nice\nfeeling to be on the same wavelength\nsometimes\nand to be able to talk shop and bounce\nideas around and learn\nand\nyou know like writing a book you put it\nout into the world\nand it's your art it's your baby it's\nyour ideas it's imperfect and you put it\nout there\nand then\nit's just out in the world to be\nhated misunderstood liked whatever and i\nfind myself on a daily basis i come back\nto\ni sort of do it as a kind of like a\ni don't know like a prayer or a\ncommunication with my mom who's who\npassed away and i sort of have a\nconversation with her about the book\nand i i kind of asked for support in\nletting go of ego letting go of\ninsecurity\nand just like keep coming back to the\nidea of what's my intention here\nand it's like\ndo like show up and do my reasonable\nbest\nat creating something that can help\npeople and then release it and remain\nunattached from the outcome\nand when i say my reasonable best i\nreally like you know i wrote this book\nwhile working as a mom with very\nunpredictable child care in a pandemic\nlike you know which felt important in\nterms of my writing process was like i\nwas really\nin it in terms of\nyou know i'm writing about how do we\ncultivate calm and resilience in the\nface of strife and it's like okay i have\nsome very real world data to work off of\nand\num and i think you know i think that's\nactually really an important takeaway is\nthat when we try to do our best best and\nshow up and give everything our 150\neffort and bend ourselves into a pretzel\nand squeeze out any possibility of\nfailure\nlike\nwe\nwe drive ourselves crazy and we still\ndon't completely control the outcome\nand so i really think it's such a good\nself to anxiety to give ourselves\npermission to show up and do our\nreasonable best something you can feel\nproud of\nbut it's sustainable and it doesn't get\nyou out of balance\nand so yeah i think the internet is an\ninteresting both and with this we can\nfeel so seen and so connected and so\nmisunderstood\nall at the same time but i find what's\nso protective is\nall i can do is do my reasonable best\nput it out there trying to help and let\ngo\nyeah i was actually\num i want to honor you i was watching\none of your stories the other day where\nyou were\nwalking your your child to the school\nand kind of not acknowledging your\nintention that you were just sharing\nhere which is that you know there's a\nlot going on in your life and having\nbeen through a book launch myself i can\nonly imagine what your schedule is and\neven carving out those moments to just\nbe present to the walk to school however\npresent you were able to be of course\nand i think that's where this idea is\nperfectly and perfect or learning how to\njust you know be where we're at in any\ngiven moment\ni know as someone who has a history of\nalways setting bars up so high for\nmyself and always trying to get it all\ndone and be perfect and check all the\nboxes over here professionally and then\nbe perfectly present to everyone else in\nmy life and again those are for a lot of\nus very unrealistic expectations and\nanxiety just bring the conversation very\nmuch full circle inducing one so the\nmore we can kind of peel it back and\nlearn how to embrace whatever it is for\nus our messiness in a given moment a\ncrazy book launch week and a couple\nmoments to be present you know on a walk\nto school um for for most of us in my\nopinion that that's where life is\nhappening um however when we're in our\nmind about all the other places we\nshould be we're really limiting our\nopportunity to\nwords you brought up earlier to be\nconnected to to be right kind of\nbeautifully attuned to whatever is here\nnow\nyeah that's beautifully said\nyeah\ni feel like we should oh yeah go ahead\ni was just gonna say we should maybe\ntouch upon the concept of psych meds i\nwonder if that's on anybody's mind\nwhile we have this conversation what do\nyou think of that direction you'd want\nto go absolutely yeah if you're open um\nyeah i think it's important because we\ntake you know it's in our name right we\ntake a holistic approach and like what\nthe heck does that mean nobody you know\nlike when we say it i think what we mean\nsomething similar which is\nwell we're not just thinking about\nmental health from like the neck up it's\num it's the whole\nperson it's the it really broadens in a\nlot of different directions it's it's\nyour genes but it's also your community\nand your connection to nature and your\ndiet and your gut health and your you\nknow everything in your environment and\nback generations\nand i think that um i think really\nholistically about mental health\nand\ni think that sometimes people perceive\nthat as being kind of like a um dogmatic\nor sort of adversarial stance against\nconventional medicine i think sometimes\ni do kind of get like a little saucy and\ntake an adversarial stance against\nconventional medicine working through my\ntrauma for my training but i think that\num\ni i really it's a nice thing about i\nthink i'm about 10 years into practice\nat this point and it's a really nice\nhumbling work because just as soon as\ni've latched on to any kind of dogmatic\nidea of like i've got this figured out i\nknow how to help patients\nsomething always kicks me in the teeth\nand teaches me like no you don't got it\nfigured out and you know that has\nhappened\nenough times at this point that i really\nrealized that like i actually am so\nsupportive of so many different\napproaches i'm not invested in being\nright about this approach to anxiety i'm\ninterested in reducing\nhuman suffering\nby whatever means\nand i think that\ni i've seen so many of my patients\nbenefit from medication\nand you know give the sort of like full\ncourt approach to the holistic\nstrategies\nand at the end of the day they needed a\nmedication as a bridge to get out of a\nplace and get to\nmore solid ground where they could start\nto do these practices\nand i've also seen\nyou know in a way that to me is like a\nmore important un underserved part of\nthe mental health population\ni've seen a lot of people\nnot find medications to be sufficiently\nhelpful\nand i feel like in a way you know if if\nmedics are working for you\nmy holistic approach is not intended to\nmake somebody second guess that or feel\nlike it's the wrong approach like\nif meds are working haul a lulu\nand like go forth you know if you've\nfound your path that's great um but you\nprobably don't need me because like the\nexisting system is working for you but\nthere's all these millions of people for\nwhom the existing system is not working\nand i think that it's for those folks\nthat i want them to know\nthere's reason for hope there's more\nthat you can do\nif you feel like you've been showed up\nand spit out by the mental health world\nif you feel discouraged like you tried\nevery medication and nothing's working\nor it works and then the effect fades or\nyou experience side effects whatever the\ncase may be\nit's those folks i want them to know\nmeds are not the only path up this\nmountain there are so many other things\nwe can do my book outlines like a buffet\nwhich is not to say you have to do all\nthese things it's that you reach for\nwhat feels doable accessible what\nresonates but there's going to be some\npath there that at least helps you in\nyour journey\nand\ni think if anything we're just missing a\nlittle bit of the informed consent in\nthat initial conversation about meds um\nwe need more time\nlike\npractitioners need more time with\npatients so they can actually talk\nthrough what's really going on with you\nwhat would really are some\nrealistic possibilities of what happens\nwith these meds what would it be like to\neventually get off these meds i think\nthat's missing from the conversation\nbut if you're on a med and it's working\nthis is great\nlike we just want everyone to find their\npath to feel well\ni appreciate you you going there uh\nellen and and\ndiscussing all of that and when i hear\nwhen i say and i couldn't agree more\nwith with this informed consent model\nand the need for an informed consent\nmodel because what i think we're both um\nacknowledging is needed is\nmore information right because the\npeople who are out there and i myself\nhave worked with and known personally\nmany people for that fall into that camp\nof medication didn't work and actually\nled me to only feel more disempowered\nbecause all along the way i couldn't\nhelp but wonder why is everyone else\ngetting better and i can't there must be\nsomething\nwrong you know inherently intrinsically\nwith me that that which is supposed to\neven the professionals maybe that are in\nfront of me telling me it's supposed to\nwork\nit's not working and before long what\nmost of us do unfortunately or what a\nlot of us have learned to do i should\nsay is to believe\neveryone out there and not our own\ninstincts that's saying you know this\nisn't working for you there is something\nthat this isn't feeling aligned for\nthere are symptoms that have now began\nin your life as a result of taking or\nwhatever the journey is so in terms of\nand that's why i love your work i love\nyour new book here the anatomy of\nanxiety it's because what what you're\noffering is is other information and and\nfor me that was life-changing not having\nhad access when i was in school when i\nwas on my own journey you know trying to\nfeel my own anxiety for a very long time\nto this information\nis what kept me stuck and that's one of\nthe reasons why i do the work i do as\nwell which is to present other\ninformation with our goal and not to\nspeak for you but i imagine it's very\nmuch the same which is to empower that\nhuman who has those instincts that inner\nknowing who is kind of knowing what path\nis aligned for them and which isn't and\nto begin to put more trust in that take\nin information from experts get support\nfrom those in your life but don't do\nthat at your own expense don't over step\nright that inner knowing so i you know\nsee such\nsuch a beacon again of hope in the work\nthat you put out into the world and in\nthe work that is between these pages of\nthe anatomy anatomy of anxiety because i\nknow that this is what this book will\noffer\npeople is the information to have a\ndeeper understanding of what might be\ncausing the symptoms that they're\nsuffering and the practical then\napproach the tools the how to now build\nthat bridge to begin to make change\nyeah and i think\nwe share this experience like that's\nthat's my story too is that i i was i\nwas sort of in a state of false\ndepression overlaid on top of a layer of\ntrue depression and\nand my process was really inefficient\nand it was so demoralizing to feel like\ni saw the right doctors i did what they\nrecommended and at a certain point it\nwasn't helping they're like okay i can't\nhelp you and that's devastating when\nyou're like wait i'm so broken that this\nlike they don't even know what to\nsuggest next and so you can feel so\ndiscouraged so hopeless\nand that's on top of you know when\nyou're struggling with anxiety or\ndepression you already see things\nthrough the lens of depression or\nanxiety things already feel overwhelming\nand hopeless and then you layer on top\nof that feeling like the conventional\nstrategies are ineffective and you're\nlike this is grim\nand i went on this 10-year journey of\ngoing down lots of dead ends like how\ncan i feel better\nand in the end it gave me a lot of tools\nand a lot of sympathy for like where\npeople get stuck and where they struggle\nand um in many ways the book is just\nwhat i wish i had\nand it's saying like let me let me\nconsolidate the learnings of 10 years of\ngetting my own health back into balance\nand 10 years of medical practice and put\nthose learnings in one book so that\nsomeone who is feeling stuck and is\nreally struggling\nhas somewhere to turn and has some\nsuggestions to try\nand\nand i really like that you brought up\nlike trusting ourselves and you're\nexactly right like it's not to\ncompletely\nignore like you know experts and trusted\npractitioners and whoever in your life\nyou feel like they have something to\noffer take that in but always discern\nlike does this feel like a yes to me or\ndoes that actually not resonate take the\ngood leave the bad and never forget to\nlisten internally\nand i think our world conditions us to\nignore that i know i did i was for years\ni sort of silenced my intuition because\ni felt like it was not safe to be\nembracing intuition i didn't want to be\nseen as an irrational\nyou know crazy woman and i wanted to be\naccepted in the boys club i wanted to be\nseen as objective and rational and good\nat math and like so that's what i leaned\ninto but it was a betrayal of a part of\nmyself\nand eventually i learned to embrace both\naspects of myself but very much\nactually celebrating and embracing and\ninviting in my intuition as another tool\nanother compass for navigating the\nvagaries of life and i really like\nencouraging everybody to dust off their\nconnection with their intuition\nand we don't need to be ashamed of it\nit's really a beautiful compass\ni love this kind of ending here with\nthis idea of another and\nright all of this at once\ni think that's so much more emblematic\nof a human the complexity of us as\ncreatures and the more we can expand\ninto i have my intuition i can take in\nall this information from the outside\nworld and i can feel a million different\nways about one thing and you know the\nmore we can expand into that space where\nwe can become and another here's some\nextra tools it doesn't have to be kind\nof this one thing and oftentimes it\nisn't and we are very very complex\ncreatures so before we end here thank\nyou\ndr\nall of which that you put out into this\nworld and for this incredible book and\ncan you let us all know where we can go\nahead and find our own copy of the\nanatomy of anxiety yeah i mean you can\nlike as they say buy it wherever books\nare sold my personal bias is like try to\nsupport your local bookstore um try to\nsupport black owned businesses like you\nknow use your dollars somewhat\nstrategically but um you can get it\npretty much anywhere right now and\num and i really i really hope it's\nhelpful and i'm also really open to\nfeedback and gentle loving feedback\num because i really do want to learn how\nto meet people's needs better\nbut i hope that this is a good start i\nam so grateful for having connected with\nyou however long ago that it was and so\nexcited actually i said sit with you\nalongside of you
