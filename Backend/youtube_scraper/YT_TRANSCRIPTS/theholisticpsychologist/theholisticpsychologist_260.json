    "transcript": "this video actually comes from a\nquestion and comment that i recently\nreceived the question was asking how to\nfeel your feelings so this video will\ncover first what feelings are and why\nthey're important then we'll explore\nsome common reasons why many of us don't\nfeel our feelings and we'll end by\ntalking about how to begin to feel our\nfeelings\nso feelings are evolutionarily designed\nto give us information about how safe or\nunsafe our environment is to evolve as a\nspecies this was an incredibly important\ninformation\nfeelings are actually short-lived\nmeaning they don't last very long\nactually research has indicated they\nlast somewhere around 90 seconds\nas physiological events which simply\nmeans they happen in the body they map\non to sensation shifts or changes in our\nbody again giving us information about\nwhat's happening around us\nthey are based in an interpretation of\nthe situation not objectively\nnecessarily what's happening our goal is\nto decide if what's happening again is\nsafe and we can remain in our present\nlocation or if it's unsafe and we might\nneed to do something about it while our\nemotions are incredibly important to\nhelp us navigate life so many of us\nweren't taught by our caregivers how to\nmanage our own emotional feelings\nsome of the reasons why are many of our\ncaregivers didn't know how to tend to\ntheir emotions themselves\nthey might have been overwhelmed by\ntheir own emotions or our emotions and\nnot showed up to help support us\nwhen we're young we need that support we\nneed someone to help us make sense of\nthe emotions we're feeling we need\nsomeone to help support us when we feel\noverwhelmed and when we don't have that\nas a result of feeling overwhelmed by\nour emotions we might distance ourselves\nwe might check out we might shut them\ndown or avoid them all together\nsome of us even were taught messages\nmaybe from our immediate family\nenvironment influenced by culture by\ngender maybe from the mass environment\nthe culture in which we live\nsome of us were taught some emotions\naren't acceptable we shouldn't show them\nfor whatever reason\nwe might have been told to look on the\nbright side maybe we had experiences in\nchildhood where our emotions had a\ndirect impact or we were told they had a\ndirect impact on others around us stop\ndoing that you're making me mad might be\nsomething we have heard\nall of those messages for us get\ninternalized and then they become our\nbeliefs around emotions that some are\nunacceptable and should be avoided at\nall cost so then we do just that we\navoid them ourselves so how do we do the\nwork of feeling our feelings\nwe all have feelings again they give us\nincredibly important information to\nreconnect with our body and the emotions\nthat live in there and then to give us\nthe opportunity to practice some new\ntools where we don't have to check out\nrun away numb or distance ourselves from\nthese feelings\nso here are some steps\nthe first step begins with reconnecting\nto our body learning how to be present\nin our body remember emotions are\nsensations they live in our body if\nyou're like me as a result of that\nchildhood overwhelm you might have\ndisconnected from your body or gone away\non your spaceship as i call it\nfor us the work begins in learning how\nto reconnect with our body in a moment\nof quiet focusing on your body how does\nit feel are there any sensations that\nare alive that are present if you can\ntake that a step further and maybe\nidentify what feeling those sensations\nmight map onto is it sadness is it grief\nis it anger\nwhat's alive in your body i'm going to\nhit pause here suggesting that those of\nyou who are disconnected from your body\nspend some time on that first step\nthat's not one to quickly pass by to get\nto step two\nright we have to first identify the\nsensations that are alive inside of us\nbefore we can take step two being\npresent with those feelings\nallowing them to come to an end what i\nmean when i say that is notice when\nyou're playing a role in keeping your\nfeelings alive and usually that role\nbegins in your mind\nright when you\nfeel the event happening in your body\nand then you begin to tell yourself a\nstory\nmaybe you replay what happened that led\nto those emotions in your body\nmaybe you're rehashing an old past wound\nthat might have happened decades ago\nbecause you're remembering it in your\nmind\nright step two means being present in\nyour body understanding when you're\ntaking your emotion from your body to\nyour mind and obviously breaking that\nhabit so then\nyou can actually age your body in\nreleasing that feeling once we're back\nin our body and we're not in our mental\nstories\nthen we can begin to experiment with\nwhat works for you when you have that\nenergy that might be coursing through\nyou that you might be calling anger is\nnow a good opportunity to take a walk\nor for you might it be a good\nopportunity to take a bath to allow that\nfeeling to move through you and i pose\nthat as a question because only you can\nknow\nfor me i had to explore for myself\nwhat helps me release my feelings when\nit's sadness does that look different\nwhen it's anger for me sometimes it does\nexperiment get curious does something\naction make you feel better moving and\nshaking your body or to something more\ngrounding and relaxing finding a place\nto lay or be present on the earth would\nthat be more helpful\ni'd love to hear from those of you out\nthere who are beginning your journey\ninto feeling your feelings what\nchallenges are you coming up against and\nwhat's been most helpful in your journey"
