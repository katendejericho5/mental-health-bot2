    "transcript": "do you live from your heart\nthis video will explore the heart brain\nconnection\nit will introduce a concept called heart\ncoherence\nthen we'll explore ways to begin to\ncultivate heart coherence in our mind\nand body our heart and our brains are\nconnected by the vagus nerve and they\ncommunicate with each other sending\nsignals back and forth\nthe different signals they send are\nhormonal\nare electrical\nare with pressure or pulse waves and are\nalso energetic signals\nsending messages back and forth all day\nlong\nheart coherence is the variability in\nour heart rate\nas humans our heart rate actually\ndoesn't beat in a rhythmic pattern it's\nreally variable when we breathe in\nour heart speeds up when we breathe out\nit slows down we breathe in and out all\nthe time with our heart speeding\nand slowing throughout the day\nall of this is regulated outside of our\nawareness by something called our\nautonomic nervous system we don't have\nto think about making these changes our\nbody just does\nheart coherence\nis a particular pattern of communication\nbetween our heart and our brain that\nindicates a synchrony between all of the\nsystems in our body not just our heart\nand brain but all of the other organs\nthat our heart and brain communicate\nwith also sending messages\nto heart coherence or this particular\nrhythmic pattern that i'm going to show\nyou on the next slide\nit actually plays an incredibly\nimportant role in our mental or our\nemotional health allowing us to feel\nstable and to feel resilient\nit also plays an incredible role in our\nbody and our physical systems of\nsleeping our immune system how our\noverall energy levels when we are in\nheart coherence we feel like we have\nmore energy we sleep better and we're\nable to regulate our stress and our\nemotions much better\nhere are two examples of what a coherent\npattern looks like\nthis can be found when we experience\npositive emotions like appreciation love\ncare compassion gratitude\nour emotions actually create changes in\nour patterns\nincoherent patterns look like this\nwhen we experience frustration and worry\nwe fall out of heart coherence and we\nsuffer the effects of it\nso how do we begin to do the work\nwe begin to do the work when we first\nacknowledge that our body and its stress\nresponses are affecting our heart and\nour overall body functioning and our\nemotional functioning\nwe can begin then to take step two which\nis to create heart coherence to fall\ninto that rhythmic pattern and how do we\ndo that\nwe can do that by\npracticing our breathing by learning how\nto create calm if we are feeling\nstressed or worried and we can do that\nby elongating our exhalation like we\ntalked about earlier when we're exhaling\nwe're already slowing down our body\ncalming the stress calming the worry\nhelping our brain and heart fall back\ninto that coherent pattern\nwe can also cultivate heart coherence as\nwe begin to release those stored\nemotions the anxiety the anger all of\nthose emotions that are creating those\nincoherent patterns\nacknowledging them and allowing your\nbody to actually energetically release\nthem will allow your heart and brain to\nfall back into coherence\nwe can also practice cultivating those\nemotions of appreciation\nof gratitude yes we can practice\nemotions some of you might even have a\ngratitude practice or taking a moment to\nfeel or summon the feelings of\ncompassion can again help your brain\nand your body achieve those coherent\npatterns\ni'd love to hear from you out there have\nyou ever heard of this brain heart\nconnection or this concept of heart\ncoherence and if you have\nwhat success have you had with any of\nthese practices"
