    "transcript": "what's really causing your anxiety\nthis video will explore root causes for\nanxiety and of course how to begin to\nheal\nto get started before we understand what\ncould be causing our anxiety we have to\nunderstand the new science of\nepigenetics or simply we are not our\ngenes for a very long time we believe\nthat things such as anxiety and panic\nwere caused by the dna or the genetics\nwe were born with at birth\nwe now know that genetics are of course\npart of the story though our lifestyle\nchoices our environments play a great\nrole in whether or not we get the\nsymptoms of anxiety or the more extreme\nversion of panic\nso what are possible root causes then\nfor anxiety\nthe first one we want to explore is\ntrauma and the related dysregulation in\nour nervous system that happens when we\nexperience trauma no matter how far\ndistant in our past\nmany of us are living with an activated\nfight-or-flight response which causes\nthe same symptoms of trauma being hyper\nvigilant feeling our heart rate increase\nalways waiting for that next shoe to\ndrop maybe even scanning our environment\nlooking for the next threat\nfeels very much like what we call\nanxiety\nagain that is the result of our nervous\nsystem being ready for action\nbeing in fight-or-flight mode again no\nmatter if there is no\nthreat even\npresent that means that some of us have\nexperienced trauma early in our lives\nand never actually shifted out of that\nnervous system state so we walk into\nadulthood far beyond the years of the\ntraumatic experience still living with\nthose same\nsymptoms i know for myself that was very\nmuch part of my story\nsomething else we want to explore are\nlifestyle choices that may be causing\nthe symptoms that we call anxiety what\ndo we mean by lifestyle we mean what are\nwe eating we now understand that our gut\nplays an incredibly important role in\nour mental and emotional wellness why is\nthat our gut is also where we produce\nthe majority of our serotonin serotonin\nis the number one neurotransmitter\nthat's been implicated in anxiety the\nbelief is we don't have enough serotonin\nyou get symptoms of anxiety now again we\nused to think serotonin was produced in\nour brain we now know that our gut\nproduces the largest majority of\nserotonin if our gut is damaged if we're\neating foods that cause or poke holes in\nour gut wall\nwe might be compromising the functioning\nof our gut not able to absorb the\nnutrients and not producing the\nserotonin that we need thus resulting in\nanxiety a third thing happens when we\ncause damage to our gut toxins can leak\nout into our system causing inflammation\ninflammation can again\ncause symptoms of anxiety many of us\naren't even aware that the food that\nwe're putting in our body is not only\nnot nutrient dense it might actually be\ncausing that gut damaging holes and\nagain the inflammation that's causing\nour symptoms of anxiety\nanother incredibly important lifestyle\nchoice that might be contributing to\nyour anxiety is your sleep habits\nnamely those of us who aren't sleeping\nenough when our body is not rested we\ncan feel in our bodies those same\nsymptoms that mimic anxiety\nmovement\nwhen we don't move our body tension\nbuilds up in our muscles and we register\nthat tension as anxiety in our body\nlearning how to move our body in slow\ngentle ways even activating our\nparasympathetic nervous system through\nthings such as yin yoga can shift us\nfrom that fight or flight mode that we\ntalked about earlier to the opposing\nmode the calm mode of the\nparasympathetic thus decreasing our\nsymptoms of anxiety\nanother incredibly important lifestyle\nchoice to speak about that some of us\naren't even aware is a choice\nis our\nbreathing\nwhen we breathe from a very shallow\nplace or when we breathe very quickly\nlike we do when we're anxious we might\nbe contributing to our symptoms of\nanxiety\nfirst tuning into how you're breathing\ncan be incredibly important in taking\nthe next step\nlearning how to shift your breath deeper\ninto your belly\nslowing or elongating your exhalation\ncan actually shift you from that\nfight-or-flight mode causing those\nsymptoms of anxiety back into that\nparasympathetic mode of calm\nanother thing we want to talk about is\nour hormones\nhormones in particular are sex hormones\nthe amount of estrogen we have or\ntestosterone can contribute to our\nsymptoms of anxiety as can a newly\ndiscovered mutation that affects some of\nus which is the mirther gene mthr\nthose of us who have that genetic\nmutation\naren't able to absorb those b vitamins\nthat we talked about earlier\nagain contributing to low enough b\nvitamins that amplify the experience or\nthe symptoms of anxiety\nnow how do we begin to create change how\ndo we do the work i just gave a lot of\ndifferent choices lifestyles that we\nmight be living that might be causing\nour symptoms of anxiety we don't want to\nstart by changing our life from top to\nbottom because we'll overwhelm ourselves\nthe way forward is to pick one new small\ndaily promise in any of those areas we\nexplored earlier for some of you it\nmight be sleep\nfor others it might be paying attention\nto your breath noticing that you're\nbreathing from that shallow place or\nyou're breathing very quick\nshifting into what i call a deep belly\nbreath will help you come from fight or\nflight and all of the anxiety maybe even\npanic that goes along with that\ndown into that state of calm that all\nour body needs\nfor me i know for a very long time my\nlife was filled with anxiety my twenties\nwere filled with one panic attack after\nanother\ni took the same road i began to look at\nthe choices i was making each and every\nday i was able to identify that my\nnervous system was in fight or flight i\nwas able to identify the fact that i\nwasn't eating foods that were giving me\nthe nutrients i needed and i was eating\nfoods that were causing inflammation\nthat sent me down that cycle of anxiety\nfor decades so i began the same way\nmaking one small daily promise to create\nchange changed my lifelong experience\nwith anxiety i'd love to hear from those\nof you out there who are beginning your\njourney to explore the root cause of\nyour anxiety and of course to begin to\nheal"
