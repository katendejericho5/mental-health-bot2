    "transcript": "are you an empath\nthis video is on empathy\nfirst we have to understand the concept\nof hyper vigilance\nthen we can begin to unpack what empathy\nactually is and of course will end by\nhow to begin to practice\nso what is hypervigilance\nhypervigilance is a state of increased\nsensitivity and awareness to one's\nenvironment\noften it looks and feels like a scanning\nof the environment usually for threats\nand many times we feel our heart rate\nincrease and maybe even our breathing\nchange we're on alert we're even\nagitated\nmany times this is then followed by\nconditioned behaviors aimed at\nestablishing or re-establishing safety\nso sometimes it looks like worrying\nabout the people around us tending to\nthe people around us trying to make the\npeople around us feel a certain way so\nthat then we can feel safer\nthis state of hyper vigilance is\nconnected to our nervous system when\nwe're in this state we're actually in a\nstate of fight or flight our nervous\nsystem is activated\nso what is empathy\nempathy is defined as the ability to\nunderstand another's experience through\ntwo types of understanding\nthe first is emotional or the ability to\nattune or sense what someone else might\nbe feeling\nand then the second level of\nunderstanding is a cognitive or the\nability to see the world through\nanother's perspective\nso what is the difference here\nempathy happens when we're not in that\nstate of fight or flight activation we\nactually need to be in a much more calm\nreceptive mode called the\nparasympathetic mode of our nervous\nsystem\nbeing calm and open and safe and\nreceptive\nactually allows us to attune or to feel\nanother's emotional experience\nwhen we're in that state of\nhyper-vigilance or when our nervous\nsystem is activated we're not actually\ntruly sensing or feeling another person\nat all we're really hyper focused on\nourself and creating that safety for\nourselves so while we might look like\nwe're tending to the world around us\nactually our goal is aimed at changing\nour emotions not at\nbeing open and receptive and truly\nfeeling what someone else might be\nexperiencing\nso how do we begin to do the work\nbecause\nwe cannot enter an empathetic state we\ncan't truly sense another person unless\nour nervous system is safe we need to\ndrop down and do the work to cultivate\nthat balance in our nervous system\nsystem affects us\nand how to take care of our nervous\nsystem\nthis is the work in the body learning\nhow to regulate our body so we can shift\nfrom that fight-or-flight mode\nback into that calm receptive mode of\nparasympathetic so we can actually\nreceive\nthat information about someone else\nnot about ourselves at all i'd love to\nhear your questions on this topic"
