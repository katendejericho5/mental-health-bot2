    "transcript": "hi hi\noh my gosh and you're wearing your\nsweatshirt i am i am\ni believe in you i'm wearing my\nsweatshirt i have my book if i'm honest\nnow i haven't taken the sweatshirt off\nit is one of the coziest living\nitems that i own and the weather is you\nknow i would dare say not becoming\nchilly because let's be realistic i'm in\narizona but it's sweatshirt weather so\ni've been living in it thank you\noh you're welcome i'm absolutely\nthrilled uh that you love it and i'm\nglad that it feels cozy because let me\nsay self acceptance and belief in self\nis the coziest thing that you can feel\nin your whole life so that's awesome you\ngot that right and i have to say i'm\npretty selfishly jazzed that we get to\nspend some time together here chatting\nbecause i was just going into um just my\npersonal\nfeelings about you at this point we\nconnected so early on there's so much of\nour past journeys and our current that\njust resonates with me on a personal\nlevel so much so i've been honored to\nnot only cross your path now in virtual\nlife but to be so connected on our own\nhealing journey so you've been such a\npivotal person in my life and now with\nthis tool i am so excited like i said\ni'm pretty sure most of the community\nknows you knows your work and if they\ndon't i definitely want them to because\nthe way you deliver your tools is so\nimpactful and i'm super excited to have\na chat about your new book well thank\nyou and you know i gotta tell you i'm\nsuper emotional because um\ni also have to tell you that uh you have\nbeen very you've been present in my life\nfor a while\num your book was so deeply meaningful\nand um my husband has recently started\ntalking openly about his struggle with\ndepression\nand about uh childhood trauma and\nyou are\nliterally\nin bed\nyour spiral bound book we have your\nhardcover but when you sent me your\nspiral bound manuscript and how many of\nyou literally dr nicole's\nwork her book it has been so\ntransformational for you you are helping\nmy husband heal at a very profound level\nand so thank you so much it's a it's a\nreal honor to be able to see you and to\nget to talk to you\nabout\nkind of the intersection of what we're\ndoing and um i was just\nliterally\nwhen you wrote last night\nthat you found the book to be relevant\nand valuable and impactful i i don't\nknow if i'll ever be able to wear the\npair of pants i was wearing because i\nthink i had an accident\noh my god so well i mean that from the\nbottomless of my heart and hearing the\nimpact that my work continues to have in\nyour life that means the world to me and\nlike i said i'm super excited to now\nintroduce my community to your work so\ntalk to me tell me i mean i know you\ncame a long way um from the first book\nthe five second rule so\nwhat\nwhat kind of got you thinking in this\ndirection what inspired this new piece\nof work you've now put out well you know\ni feel like and you know your book\nopens with a face plant into the oatmeal\nright\nlike that you know both of us the dark\nknight of the soul i think is sort of\nwhat brought me to this work i have for\nbetter or for worse\nalways either fallen into a hole or i've\ndug one for myself and the result of a\nlot of the work that i've shared that\nhas really resonated is the result of\nneeding to figure out how to build a\nladder\nto climb out of a hole that i have found\nmyself in or dug for myself\nand you know the the five-second rule\nwhich i put out five years ago after of\ncourse a profound breakdown in my life\nand\nhas gone on to impact millions of\npeople's lives and i'm super proud of\nthe fact that it's had a huge impact in\npeople's mental health and clinicians\naround the world use it uh we had a\nwhole group of um\ninpatient nurses show up at the talk\nshow i was hosting to tell me that of\nall the tools that they have impatient\nwhen they discharge somebody the five\nsecond rule is the most powerful one\nthey've got because it's simple\nand it's easy to remember and when\nyou're somebody that has cascading\nthoughts that put you in a very dark\nplace counting backwards five four three\ntwo one is an incredibly powerful tool\nand you know even knowing uh dr nicole\nthat\nmore than 111 people have stopped\nthemselves from attempting suicide by\nusing the five second rule\ni'm going to stand here right now and\ntell you\nthat i personally feel that the\nhigh-five habit\nand the tools that i share in this book\nthat have such a profound overlap with\nthe same uh tools that you're sharing\nwith your community and with the world\nat large this is going to be a hundred\ntimes more profound\nbecause the five second rule will help\nyou interrupt patterns the five second\nrule will certainly help you push\nthrough\nemotions feelings triggers trauma that\ncan hold you back or make you feel\nparalyzed\nbut it doesn't actually heal\nthe deeper stuff\nthat is causing you so much pain\nand so back to your original question\nabout how i\ncame upon the high five habit is you\nknow i didn't sit down and say okay it's\nbeen five years i better write a book\nwith a five in it you know that would\nhave been wonderful\ni literally just woke up with a really\nfamiliar feeling in april of 2020\nand the feeling is one that you know we\nall have experienced in our lives and\nwe're all going to experience again\nit's that feeling of being completely\ndisconnected from yourself\nit's feeling completely overwhelmed by\nyour life\nit's feeling emotionally depleted\num and just\nabsolutely exhausted\nby the demands coming at you and the\njust\noverwhelming amount of stuff to do\nand so on one particular morning and\ni'll tell you kind of the two days in\nthis story that i think will really\nresonate with you and i would love at\nany moment for you to stop and help me\nunpack this\nbut what happened is i woke up and you\nknow the worst place in the world for me\nis to lie in bed\num you know being a victim\nyou know of sexual trauma having been\nmolested at the age of you know eight\nwhen fourth grade waking up from a sound\nsleep\nto having a kid on top of me\nuh that\nmoment of trauma even though on the\nscale of what could happen to you it was\na one-off incident it wasn't really\nscary it was confusing i immediately\ndisassociated\ni think that one experience locked into\nmy nervous system two things anxiety and\ndisassociation\nas a response to any\nkind of\nunnerving moment\nand the second thing it locked into\nplace\nis that for the next\noh boy i don't know 42 years\nthe first thing i felt when i woke up\nevery morning was something's wrong\nand i realized now that was probably a\ntrauma response\nto the things i experienced in childhood\nyeah and\nright\nyeah the first reaction i was having in\nhearing in bed in particular right the\nintimacy of being in bed in bed for many\nof us is where our thoughts you know\nkind of get the best of us and our minds\nrun whether it's right before we go to\nsleep or when we arise in the morning\nand i had\nanticipated you were going to talk about\nthat aspect of it so when you compound\nthe intimacy of bed and sleep and the\nsafety if we don't feel safe we can't\neven drift off to sleep and again\noftentimes our mind runs so if you\ncompound that with a trauma with a\nviolation then in that intimate space of\nyour bedroom where one is supposed to\nneeds to be safe then of course i can't\nimagine the impact that you carried even\noutside of your awareness when you say\ndissociation a lot of us disconnect when\nthings like that happen when we're too\nyoung it's too overwhelming it's too\nconfusing we don't have the support\naround us to make sense of it we leave\nhowever it doesn't mean it leaves us and\nfor many of us even waking in the\nmorning it's when our cortisol is the\nhighest again we have those racing\nthoughts we have the whole day ahead of\nwhatever that might bring\nand then again if for you you were\nawoken\nin the middle of the night with\nsomething so violating i can't even\nimagine what bed was for you even if you\nweren't fully aware of it it was still\nliving in your body in your emotion and\nin your in your spirit yeah totally and\nyou know the next morning when i went\ndownstairs because we were at this kind\nof like a big family trip lots of\nfamilies there all the kids in a bunk\nroom\num\nwhen i got downstairs my mom was cooking\nwith all the moms and\nshe turned around and she goes\nhow'd you sleep\nand i immediately wanted to tell her\nhere's the interesting thing\ni wasn't nervous about my mom's reaction\nbecause she's a farm gal i know she\nwould take that spatula and probably you\nknow clock the kid in the next week like\nthere would be stuff would go down\nall of a sudden froze because the kid\ni could see him out of the corner of my\neye\nand i didn't know what he would do\nand that was the moment that i locked a\ncoping mechanism\ntriggered by trauma into my being and\nthat is\nthe second you're worried about a\nreaction lie\njust say what you think\nis going to make the situation okay\nand so i did i said fine\nand it wasn't until probably 20 years\nlater that i actually consciously\nremembered this\nor that i um\nliterally started talking about it and\nthen i spent another couple decades\ntrying to unwind the trauma and link it\nall together and i can really take it\nback probably even further but that was\nreally a defining moment for me\nabsolutely well i want to thank you um\nfirst and foremost i should have thanked\nyou before i kind of entered in there\nfor sharing something so vulnerable um i\nknow how difficult for even for some of\nus coming to that truth ourselves right\nhaving that i'm even watching some\ncomments a couple people on this live\nright now are having light bulb moments\nit's really hard to look at our past\nexperiences with such raw honesty\nbecause then along with it comes all of\nthe feelings we have about everything\nthat happened and everything that didn't\nhappen to us so i really want to honor\nthat and i i have a question for you\nbecause you said something earlier and\ni'm interested on how these two connect\nand then of course how they connect to\nthe high five habit and the new tool\nwhen you talked about i i fall into\nholes\nright or i create them you said\nsomething along that language\nso how in your opinion do these does\nthat pivotal moment this tendency to lie\nto continue i'm sure to remain\ndisconnected from your authentic truth\nbecause i know a lot of us and i say\nthis on the heels actually of recording\na podcast myself on self-sabotage oh\nright so talk to me about falling into\nthose holes and how you believe these\ntwo obviously that pivotal moment and\nall of the coping that had happened the\nonion if you will led you to creating\nthose holes and of course now finding\nyour way out of it through this amazing\nnew tool\nwell you know it's so interesting that\nwe're starting here and it's actually\nperfect\nbecause\ni can say now\nbeing on the side of it and particularly\nnow that i've done emdr's psychedelic\nguided modalities i've gone head first\ninto healing trauma it's part of my\nday-to-day life\nto\nuh understand my trauma to to be\ncompassionate with it to heal it to take\ncare of myself the high five habit has\nbeen extraordinary in that regard we're\ngonna get to it in a minute but i wanna\ni wanna try to be as careful as possible\nbecause\ni\nreally get like viscerally uh like angry\nwhen i hear people talk about how you\nknow you're responsible for everything\nbecause i don't fundamentally believe\nthat i feel i can see\nthat\nbecause of things that happened to me\nespecially things that weren't my fault\ni whether that's the womb that you were\nuh you know in or your mother's this\nregulation because she was a team you\nknow a young teen mom like mine away\nfrom her family and on edge you know\nwhether you were in a household with\naddiction or mental illness or or\nabandonment or whatever\nlike none of that stuff's your fault but\ni can now see\nhow my own coping mechanisms\njust because i didn't know any better\nwere the things that kept digging holes\nin my life\nthe constant insecurity\nand trauma response that led me to\nalways be worried about what other\npeople thought always felt that it was\nmy job to keep the peace always one step\nahead of everybody to make sure i didn't\nget hurt and i think a lot of even me\nand the pace that i've lived at\ncomes from\nsleeping\nand waking up to something like that and\nso there's been this experience for me\nthat i'm now realizing that i was deeply\ninternalized if i'm moving you can't\ncatch me\nand if i'm one step ahead of you\ni can\nthink about how to be manipulate will\nnot even be i am being manipulative\nbecause i'm trying to manage your\nreaction to things but it was all coming\nfrom a deep place of pain\nand coping mechanisms that my little\nfourth grade brain grabbed in the moment\nand so yeah i take full responsibility\nfor the [ __ ] that i did\nand whether it was cheating on\nboyfriends or it was the amount of\nalcohol and addiction uh that i\nstruggled with at times in my life\nwhether it was um\njust awful gross\njealous catty comparison kind of\nbehavior whether it was squandering\nopera i mean where do you want to go i\nmean if i if i started to like tell you\nwhat i used to be like you'd be like oh\nrobin\ngirl holy cow i guess\nand it's a lot of it's in the book i\nmean i like you\nthe anxiety was so profound i have very\nvery few memories from basically 35\nyears until about eight years\nand that was even while i was medicated\non zoloft and i've only come to start to\nunderstand\nhow\none coping mechanism when you're in the\nfourth grade can spin out of control and\nbecome an entire pattern\nthat controls your life\nand you're so\nunaware that lying is a way of life and\npeople-pleasing as a way of life and\nand looking outside yourself for\nvalidation and for love and for support\nis a way of life\nand your work and this new high-five\nhabit and the process of writing it and\nthe process of studying it the process\nof uncovering all this research has\ntruly been a pathway back home\nlike i i literally feel\nlike that's what this is about and\ni know you've experienced this i know\npeople in this community have\nexperienced this\nyou know there's tremendous contentment\nand joy when you finally come back home\nto yourself and you reconnect with\nyourself there's also a lot of sadness\nbecause you realize for just how long\nyou have been\ndisconnected from attacking\nloathing criticizing\nand um i think one of the reasons why\nthis book is exploding so quickly just\nlike yours your work has\nis\nbecause it's hitting something that's\nfoundational for every human being\ni think you're you're really beautifully\nillustrating it when you say those words\ncome back home\nright we all and i think a lot of\nlisteners have heard this idea of you\nknow where's my authentic self this\nintuition how do i know my guidance i\nthink a lot of us do have this belief\nthat it's first somewhere outside or we\ncan acquire it or and ultimately i\nalways use that onion analogy because\nthat's how i feel it is you peel back\nthose layers and that home is within you\none of two things happen we either\nbecome so disconnected that we can't\neven hear ourselves\nor\nthe little we hear ourselves we've\nlearned not to trust ourselves and it's\nthrough those adaptations that you're\nvery beautifully illustrating whether\nit's the people pleasing i'm seeing a\nton of listeners resonating with people\npleasing that hyper vigilance that\nalways trying to keep the peace and then\nlet's extend it further because i would\ngo as far to say especially here in\nwestern culture\nsome of that when it turns into\npersonality gets rewarded when we become\nthe overachiever the busy person the\nperson who actually can't can't stop\nwon't stop right and there's a lot of\nexternal validation that we can then\nacquire by moving by plowing through our\ngoals and by keeping ourselves busy and\ndisconnected and i think what's\nimportant and i think i'm watching a a\nlot of listeners here unpacking their\nown trauma really realizing that that is\ncoming from a place yeah that it's\ncoming usually from a wounded place and\nit was our best attempt like you said\nback my fourth grade self that was the\nbest i could do and i say that speaking\nto all the shame that i know so many of\nus carry whether or not we're aware of\nit or not every time we don't trust\nourselves every time we negate our own\nreality every time we do look outside\nfor someone else's truth that's more\nvaluable than our own we're continuing\nto erode\nthat that feeling of self that self\ntrust and it does then look like a\nreally critical pit that so many of us\nare are living around and then we become\nand i love how you weave into science\nthroughout the book we become a\nself-validating machine\nso talk to me a little bit about you\nknow kind of what you've learned in\nterms of how we keep ourselves locked in\nthis is incredible it's incredible so\nthe so the morning that i discovered\nthis thing\num i'll kind of unpack this because the\nthe the first morning and the second\nmorning i know that you're gonna take\nthis like boom even deeper so here we go\neverybody buckle up\nso it's april 2020\nand you know i can't\nuse my normal coping mechanisms\nwe're all in quarantine\nso as i lose my dream job\nand my kids college experience implode\nand they're grieving and upset and sad\nand i'm terrified for my you know scared\nfor everybody and the front line workers\nand life is upside down and the anxiety\nstarts to kind of roll back in i can't\nrun to target\ni can't go to the coffee shop\ni can't distract myself by running to do\na speech i can't go see my friends all\nof the busyness by the way which i now\ncan see was a form of self-regulating\nstress and trauma\nthat if i'm on the run i don't have to\ndeal with the woman in the mirror if i'm\nmoving and the adrenaline is pumping i\ndon't actually have to sit and be with\nmyself\nmaybe i can just outrun this stuff\nand so i and even the genesis of the\nfive second rule\nthe genesis was\nif i move fast enough\nif i launch myself out of that bed maybe\ni won't be there when the anxiety hits\nso even that was like a perfect\nillustration of just push through it\ndon't deal with it\nit's a fast thing that has profound\neffect but it doesn't hit the source of\nwhat's causing all of the\nhatred and the tension and the pain in\nthe first place\nso i get out of bed five four three two\none i make my bed that morning so i\ndon't crawl back into it\ni feel exhausted overwhelmed we've all\nfelt this before whether you felt it\nduring the pandemic or you felt it\nbecause you lost a job or somebody just\nsays i don't love you anymore or you\nhate how you look we've all felt this\ni'm overwhelmed by my life i'm exhausted\ni can't face this i get into the\nbathroom i start brushing my teeth\nand\ni immediately catch a glimpse of myself\nand i think oh my god\nyou look like hell\nand then\nthe habit starts\nthat i really want us to unpack\nbecause every single human being i'm\ndiscovering\nhas a habit that is so destructive and\nnone of us are talking about\nbecause it's so subtle and it is so hard\nbaked into your mind and it's this\nevery morning in the bathroom mirror\nyou either ignore yourself\nwhich is a form of rejection\nor\nyou pick yourself apart and see all the\nthings you need to fix\nor what you don't like\nand this isn't\nyou know this is everybody\n50 of people\nare uncomfortable or will not look at\nthemselves in the mirror\ni'll admit i raised my hand took me a\nvery long time to really truly and\nthere's still discomfort there\nof looking at myself and i used to tell\nmyself what's okay i know how i feel in\nmy body and that's my marker i feel good\ntoday and that's all i need i don't need\nto look at that mirror and not really\nunderstanding that i was in that act of\navoidance something felt very intimate\nvery vulnerable\nbefore i even got to then the criticism\nof myself it just was for me pure\navoidance i didn't really care i mean i\nwould need mirrors if i maybe put some\nmakeup on and outside of that\nme and mirrors i didn't really i didn't\nhave a relationship with them at all not\nknowing again i told myself the story of\nwhy i believed i wasn't looking at them\nuntil i dove down and unpacked it and\nunderstood that there was a discomfort\nthere and still like i said remains for\nme\nwell same for me\nso i start picking myself apart i feel\nmy energy going down and you know the\ninteresting thing as i felt myself just\ngetting so defeated\nwhy'd you get up late you haven't texted\nnicole back the dog's not walked like\ni'm just like dragging and you know all\nthe research around emotional contagion\nso do i you know that this emotion and\nnegative space is going to impact your\nproductivity like we know all this but\nit's a habit i've been doing this for\nfour decades is how long i've been doing\nthis as part of my morning routine\nand so\nif you had walked in the bathroom that\nmorning i would have spun on a dime i\ndon't even like nicole i know this is\nterrible i'm so\nsorry you're going through this\nyou don't deserve this\nbut if anybody can face this you can\nwhat do you need how could like i would\nhave lifted you up i could not think of\na thing to say\nand here's the thing i wouldn't have\neven believed it because it didn't match\nhow i was feeling\nand i don't know what came over i\nhonestly believe it was the universe the\ndivine source saying all right we're\nready for this\nbecause it is so cheesy on its face\ni'm literally in my underwear\nalone with the dog at my feet\nliterally having the dark night of the\nsoul and i lift my hand\nto my tired reflection\nbecause the woman in the mirror\nneeded\na high five\nand in that moment lightning didn't\nstrike it wasn't like the heavens opened\nand you know purple light came in and oh\nthat's not what happened you know as you\nknow too like you kind of have this\nawakening and then it's like\nnow what uh no but i felt this like\nshift and i can explain the science it's\ncrazy i felt this shift\nand the energy wasn't lovely the energy\nwas more like oh come on you know i\nlaugh okay smell come on it's like get\nout there you know you're safe you're\nfine like i kind of shoved myself i\ndidn't even think like i didn't say it\nit was a [ __ ] but\nnicole\nholy cow the second morning\nthe second morning\nthis is when\nmy healing\ntook a quantum leap\nlike i can't even wait till you guys\nhear this like i cannot wait for\neverybody to experience this i wake up\nsame overwhelm\nsame just defeated down tired anxious\nstressed alone\nand i uh five four three two one get out\nof bed i make the bed i start walking to\nthe bathroom\nand i realize i am feeling something\ni don't think i'd ever felt my entire\nadult life\nand it was this\nyou know how when you're about to walk\ninto\na cafe and you're going to see somebody\nwho just love you like them so much\nyou're about to walk in what do you feel\ni mean anything from you know excitement\nto even that warm love i think that you\nare expecting to go and receive in that\nmoment yeah\ni actually felt that\nabout seeing myself\nhow powerful\ni am\nhad never felt that as an adult\ni've been excited to see an outfit\nor what my hair looked like\nbut i had never felt that\nsense of joy or excitement about seeing\nthe human being\nthe being right because i'm thinking too\ni'm like what\ni just went down a trip of what have i\nfelt excited about and if i were to\ncategorize it was the stuff i was doing\ni would say or the you know or even an\nevent it didn't have to even be an\naccomplishment you know as i began to\nheal as i began to shift a little less\ninto i have to achieve things it would\njust still be an exciting experience i\nhad planned coming up\nand i i'm having a really hard time\nhaving consistent or frequent memories\nof just me\nbeing enough and for me you know if i\nmap it on back into childhood one of my\nmajor copings too was that doing was\nshifting from right a little girl\nself-expressing in whatever way to\nthere were things that i was it was very\nclear i was good at very early on and so\nfor me that shift into doing and then\nthe excitement the warm feelings even\nthe loving connection i could even go as\nfar to say that my doingness my\nachievements my\nlike how i was in the world\nactually for me for a long time was\npoint of connections for me in my family\nrelationships in my friendships how can\ni serve you how can i show up for you\nfriend partner whomever\nand so for me it's hard to think of\nmoments where i felt enough\nexcited warm about me\nwithout action uncloaked just raw in a\nmirror\nyeah i can totally relate to that and it\ngoes back to something you said earlier\nyou also tend to get a lot of positive\nuh\nyou know emotion and praise\nwhen\nyou're achieving those things at least i\ndid too and i think that's why i chased\nit so much i'd fuse the doing with being\nlovable\nthe achieving with being worthy\nand so as i walk into the bathroom that\nsecond morning and the sort of profound\nnature of what was unfolding\nstarted to hit me\ni have this second epiphany as i'm\nbrushing my teeth\nand that is this\nevery morning\nthere are two\npeople in the bathroom\nthere's you\nand there's a human being in the mirror\nwho needs you\nthey're trying so hard\nthey're waiting for you to wake up\nand to realize that they're there\nthey need your encouragement they need\nyour support they need your love they\nare so tired of you picking them apart\nand thinking about all the things that\nare going wrong\nand as i put my toothbrush down\ni remembered the fact that yesterday the\nday before i had been researching how do\ni need to change right now because i\nhave all these people on my team how am\ni going to show up for my family and i\nfound this piece of research from\nharvard that says that if you take just\nless than a minute of intentional\nreflection\nabout how you're going to show up\nfor the people that you're leading\nand this could apply to your family\nanybody it changes your focus your\nproductivity it changes your mood it\nchanges how you show up your ability to\nimpact and for whatever reason in that\nmoment it all fused together and i\nthought well what if i do that for me\nand i asked myself a question i had\nnever asked myself before\nand it was this\nwho do you need me to be today\nlike i asked the woman in the mirror\nwho do you need me to be today how can i\nshow up for you\nand you know what kind of popped in my\nmind that morning was like well it'd be\nnice if you were kinder to me because\ni'm trying really hard\nand then the next one was it'd be great\nif you could muster up some optimism\nhere having fun today like you know it's\nlike\nhell throw me a life my mouth and as i\nthought about it i then went and i\nraised my hand and i sealed it with this\nhigh five\nand something like it just felt like\nthis fusion\nwith the person in the mirror\nand that's when i really got it\ni got that this is so much deeper and\nmore profound\nbecause what i'm actually doing\nis i'm i'm fulfilling my\nfundamental emotional needs\ni'm seeing myself\ni'm meeting myself where i am\ni am affirming my unique\nneed\nand i am celebrating myself exactly\nwhere i am right now whether it's\nchallenging whether it's exhilarating i\nam with myself\nright in that moment in a way\nthat i don't know if i had ever been\ni think it's really you know pivotal and\ni want you know want to reiterate this\nbecause i think it's such a great point\nof understanding back to that onion\nanalogy again when you said there's two\npeople right and i could go as far to\nsay that so many of us have different\nmasks different cells right the core\nlike we were just talking about is who\nwe really are\nthough so many times in our day to day\nwe are showing up in all of these\ndifferent ways playing all of these\ndifferent roles\nand there is an us that we need to and\nthe journey becomes about connecting\nback to\nso a lot of us are kind of at odds with\neven ourselves in so many moments\nbecause we're so practiced at showing up\nin all of these other ways that we've\nlost so much sight of the authentic core\nwithin each of us and what you're also\nillustrating i think that's so important\nis the daily the practice of that\nreconnection right and many of us start\nby\nnot knowing not seeing ourselves not\nknowing what there is even to see or to\nself-express\nfor me i share this story often i to\nreally when i came to the awareness that\ni like you and like many of us filter\nthe whole world through everyone else\nand what their needs may be\ni had a big gaping hole of knowledge i\ndidn't know myself i didn't really know\nthat person in the mirror i did know\nthat we do i believe as humans\nuniversally i don't care where you're\nsigning onto this live right now around\nthe globe\nwe have at our core\nthe desire to be seen to be heard to be\njust in full self-expression and for\nthat to be enough\nyet i didn't know who that person was so\ni share this because i do want to speak\nto the people who as we begin to look in\nthe mirror and for a lot of us it might\njust be a concept okay there's an\nauthentic self in there where i don't\nknow where that person is i don't know\nwhat that person needs yet\nand that's when we begin the journey to\nexplore because i like many of us didn't\nknow at first was profoundly\nuncomfortable with even beginning to ask\nthose questions what do i need right now\ncan i just be enough in this moment and\nit is the question that sets us off into\nthe journey and i share that because i\nknow a lot of us\nwe want to know the answers or we think\nwe should and then we shame ourselves\nout of even taking the journey into\nexploring those but for me i'll share\nthat's how my journey began not knowing\nat all with incredible discomfort even\naround stopping to even ask myself those\nquestions\nand of course like you said it does not\nhappen overnight i say there's no light\nswitch here oh i heal now\nand again i want to highlight the\npractice of it right because there's\nconcepts there's books there's you know\npeople and teachers and tools and\ntechniques and they're all in theory\nuntil like i say we bridge the gap from\ntheory into action and that's what i've\nalways resonated so much with your work\num from the five seconds five seconds\nthis idea of the tool how do i\npractically apply this and now of course\nthe high five habit how do i turn this\nidea into a daily action that can\nactually help me create the change that\ni'm looking for to a reconnect with that\nperson beneath and b\nto over time\ngrow to love them over time grow to love\nthem\ni love the overtime now here's how i'll\nunpack the experience of doing this\nbecause we've now studied it for a year\nthe science is so\nincredible about what we're going to\nteach you to do because we're going to\nteach you to take programming\nthat is already in your subconscious\nbrain and already stored in your nervous\nsystem\nand you've been giving it to other\npeople i'm going to teach you for free\nhow to aim it back at yourself and\nbenefit from it this is bananas and in\nfact dr nicole\nsome of this stuff i only learned two\nweeks ago and it's not even in the book\nbecause i spent a couple hours with dr\ndaniel amen he went crazy over this and\nexplained a bunch of things that i\ndidn't even understand using science so\nwait till you all hear this\nso\nwhen you do this i want you to start\nthis practice right after you brush your\nteeth because as you talk about a lot as\nthe research shows\nif you stack something new something\nvery very small you're more likely to be\nsuccessful in a remembering to do it and\nif it's tiny and small it's in your work\nit's a simple promise that you can keep\nand when you keep your word to yourself\nit's how you mend the years of betraying\nyourself and so this stacks really\nbeautifully in with all the stuff that\ndr nicole has suggested that you think\nabout when you start making and keeping\nsimple promises so we're going to brush\nour teeth right because we got to get\nthe gunk out of our mouth we don't want\nto spread dragon breath all over\neverybody let's also then use the high\nfive habit and let's get the gunk out of\nour mind body and spirit\nso that we're not spreading all of that\ninto the world now there's a couple\nthings that you're going to experience\nwhen you first try this i would expect\nthat you know a lot of you listening\nuh may not feel weird doing it but the\neverybody feels like okay really like\nthis is kind of weird i mean i know i'm\nwatching you too but even for you too\nthis is a little strange so you know i\nget it it's okay i'm gonna explain\nneurologically why you're gonna think\nit's weird\nthe reason why you think it's weird\nimmediately\nis because you have the opposite habit\nof rejecting or criticizing yourself as\npart of your morning routine right now\nso if i were to lose this arm my right\nhand and i have to suddenly write with\nmy left hand my opposite hand it's going\nto feel weird because it's new\nthat's great news that just means your\nbrain is learning something new okay\nso expect it to feel a little funky\nsecond thing is you're only going to\nhave one or one of two reactions to this\nit's either really positive\nso you go to raise your hand and you'll\nstart laughing a lot of people do that\nbecause it is kind of funny the first\ntime you do it\nbut that's also because every time you\nhave ever received or given a high five\nto somebody else\nyour brain drips dopamine\nso dr amon was also telling me the\nreason why you feel a boost in your mood\nafter you do it is because your brain\nreleases dopamine your brain doesn't\nknow the difference between high fiving\nsomebody else and you high-fiving\nyourself\nit gives you the exact same response in\nyour own body that's already programmed\nin there whenever you high-five somebody\nelse\nthe other reaction that's positive and\nmaybe you can help me unpack this is we\nget a tremendous number of people dr\nnicole who write to us and say is it\nnormal\nto burst into tears\nand i think it's not only normal i think\nit's beautiful\nbecause i think it's an emotional\ncathartic spiritual release\nof you finally\ncoming back home\nyeah\ni interestingly enough i am was posting\na couple weeks ago i think in about\ntears\ncrying\nright and all of the different emotions\nthat are released in you know the tear\nthe crying process it's not just i think\ntraditionally we think of sadness and\nsad um\nthe nervous system reaction behind the\nrelease you know it can engulf any and\nembody a ton of different feelings and\nit is and i think it highlights too i\ntalk a lot about our energetic being you\nknow describing emotions as as\nphysiological events and as energies in\nour body so especially if you've\nresonated at the start of our talk with\nme and you sharing i'm disconnected i'm\ndissociated i don't know how i feel\nchances are doesn't mean that you're not\nhaving those feelings\nchances are they're stuck they're\nstagnant and they're pent up inside of\nyou i will be the first to admit when i\nbegan my healing journey shortly after\nthe bowl of oatmeal the bowl of oatmeal\nwas just the beginning i probably spent\na good three to six months crying\nand i'm not i i mean historically i mean\nyes i cry at moments i'm not a hugely\ntearful person i go as far as like i\nwhen i was associated it was not a\nhugely emotional person stress i had\ndown i knew how to be stressed i knew\nhow to stress the world around me out\nany other feeling though right if i were\nto drop in and be vulnerable be sad be\nangry i would tell you i wasn't either\nof those things because all i really\nregistered was stress so that level of\ndisconnection right there was so much\nfeeling and when i began my healing\njourney i didn't even know why i was\ncrying half the time so the the bowl of\noatmeal story for those of you who read\nmy book was one of many in moments of\ndays even where tears were such a part\nand i couldn't explain them i didn't\nhave words if my partner lolly at the\ntime would have asked me like as she\noften did like what's wrong\ni mean through tears i would just i\ndon't know i didn't really even have\nwords yet the release of crying for me\nwas quite a consistent on the beginning\nof my journey and that's how i\nunderstand it all of those years\nof deep sadness deep anger deep wounding\nthat i ran from just like you kept\nmyself distracted from as i began to be\nyou know just a little more dropped in a\nlittle more consciously aware of myself\nand a little more safe because of the\nrelationship that i was in and was\ncreating for myself at the time i was\nable to then blow the cap off and out it\ncame so for me i would say tears was\nsuch an\nimportant release\nfor me to heal that wasn't just tears of\nsadness all the time a lot of times\ntears like i said have all different\nfeelings pent up in them\nyeah\nwell it's very common and i think it's a\nreally beautiful thing and i loved you\nknow when you talked about the energetic\nthing i immediately had this like\nfeeling of almost like plugging a cord\ninto a wall and that there's this sort\nof energetic exchange when you come back\nhome to yourself and you know people are\nwriting to us about the delight that\nthey're feeling and so that's incredible\nbut the more likely the more likely\nexperience\nis probably resistance\nand i want to tell you the three sources\nof the resistance that we've identified\nand there's probably even more but i\nwant you to know this is very very\ncommon\num\nfirst of all for those of us that have\nexperienced trauma or abuse or neglect\nor discrimination or poverty or all\nkinds heartbreak abandonment\nanything that you have survived\na lot of us drag that into the bathroom\nevery morning and it stands between you\nand the person and the mirror\nand you see it as evidence that the\nperson you're staring at if you'll even\nlook at them\nis damaged\nor unworthy\nor whatever you say unlovable\nand\nso\nthe resistance is this deep-seated\nbelief that because of those things that\nyou've survived you\ndo not deserve\nthe high five\nwhich is where the resistance comes from\nso i'm here to tell you if that\nresonates for you\nthe high five is a beautiful thing\nbecause you don't need to say a word\nyou can feel all that resistance\nthat's okay\nbecause the physical gesture and the\nprogramming in your mind\ndo all the work for you\nand you know if you have survived all\nthose things\nin your life\nyou not only deserve a high five you\nneed one\nand you need one to heal\nbecause you know if you can think about\nthe times where you have given or\nreceived a high five dr nicole what does\nthe gesture communicate whenever you\ngive it to somebody\ni think high five communicate\nacknowledgement right you see that\nperson and you feel\nsome version of favor you're celebrating\nsome aspect of what they're doing yeah\nit's like i love you i see you i believe\nin you keep going if somebody's having a\nbad day shake it off you got this\nand you've never in your entire life\nhigh five somebody thought i hate you\ni hope you lose\nyou're the worst\nyou can't do it like so if you can stand\nthere and say that person in the mirror\nis unlovable but the second that you\nraise your hand to high five yourself\nyour brain takes over and so does your\nnervous system because they know what a\nhigh five means\nso it is impossible try it try it you\ncannot high five yourself and actually\nthink something terrible about yourself\nbecause your brain neurologically won't\nallow you because of the programming in\nthere it's like trying to sing the\nlyrics to a different song\nwhile let it be is playing you can't do\nit\nyou know it's in your mind and so the\nmore that you make this a daily practice\nwhat ends up happening is you silence\nthe critic and the programming\nassociated with the high five starts to\nmarry with your own reflection\nnow another thing that happens is like\nform of resistance is all the regrets\nthat you have and the shame that you\ncarry\nso if you're human you have done things\nthat you deeply regret whether it's\ncheating or lying or addiction or\nhurting others or hurting yourself all\nstuff that you did by the way\nwhile you're trying to survive\nthings that you would\ngladly forgive dr nicole or mel robbins\nfor\nbut you drag it into the bathroom every\nmorning\nand you use that\nas evidence again to see a person\nthat is not worthy of celebration\nbecause of those things this was\nactually a really big insight because of\nchris my husband\nso\nwhen he got out of the restaurant\nbusiness the restaurants uh that he and\nhis best friend opened ultimately shut\ndown\nand it was interesting to watch that\nhappen because when they shut down his\nbusiness partner looked at the seven\nyear experience and was like\nit's restaurants you know i'm really\nproud of what we did we worked hard we\ndid a good job like we were great\nemployers like we had a great product\nokay you know whatever we did we\nreturned the profit nope\nlet's move on um\nmy husband couldn't do it\nhe could not do it\nhe had the classic experience of shame\nthe restaurant failed i'm a failure\ni did not know dr nicole\nhow deep of a hole he had fallen into\nbecause of the masks that he was wearing\nhiding his depression\nprobably not even present to the fact\nthat he was experiencing depression and\nthen of course once he started to\nrealize that's what it was feeling like\nthere was something broken\nhe has for seven\nyears\nstood next to me at the bathroom sink\nand looked in the mirror and seen a\nhuman being who's a failure\nand when i first started doing this and\ni said to him you know i think you\nshould try this chris like this has some\ncrazy impact on me\ni think this might help bring the light\nback in\nand he said\nthat high fiving yourself is the\nstupidest thing i've ever heard\nand as we unpacked what the stupid was\nbecause i said actually chris\ni think the reason why you think it's\nstupid is because you don't think you\ndeserve one\nand that's the heart of the resistance\nthat you are standing in such profound\njudgment\nthat you are refusing to give yourself\nthe forgiveness\nand the acknowledgement and the support\nthat you need to pivot and turn toward\nhealing\nand move in your life in the direction\nyou deserve to move it in and what's\ngreat about the high five is you don't\nhave to stand in front of the mirror and\ngo\ni'm great you don't have to do that and\nin fact it wouldn't work because for\nyears you've told yourself you're not\nbut the second again this is called\nneurobics it's a whole field of\nneurological research the second you\napply that physical motion your brain's\nprogramming takes over it silences the\nbeat down\nand you go\nthis and it doesn't mean yeah\nit actually is compassion it says i see\nyou\nyeah the last seven years sucked\nbut i'm still here\nand i still love you\nand i still believe in you\nit sends you into your day\nfeeling\nlike you have your own back\nand i would go as far to say that for\nmost of us\nthat compassionate acceptance is the\nfirst brick on that road too right the\nelusive self-love\nespecially i know a lot of people on\nthis on this live right now are you know\nvery aware of their narratives as i say\naround unworthiness or not being good\nenough and some of us aren't as aware of\nit though our actions our life the\nchoices we're making you know are\nreflecting that deep root of belief and\ni often make the joke of don't expect\nyou to believe how awesome you are as\nyou begin to step and walk through this\nresistance i almost say it's our\nsubconscious going to roll its eyes at\nyou right when you try to infer a lot of\nus\nfor a long time when people hear this\nidea think you know positive thinking\nand just write an affirmation and repeat\nit enough and before long you'll believe\nit that's really hard because at our\ncore we've been battling and we've\nactually been filtering the world to\nconfirm this really deep rooted negative\nbelief for so long that we're not\novernight going to believe how great i\nam we're not going to believe this\naffirmation at all and it's that\ncompassionate acceptance i believe that\nis that first step\ninto that journey so don't expect anyone\nout there who's\nbegan the high five habit or who will\ni'm seeing a lot of people getting ready\nto gear up and sign on to your challenge\ndon't expect to affirm yourself or to\naccept how great you are the first time\nyou look in the mirror especially if\nyou've been validating how ungreat you\nare how unworthy you are for so long\nit's going to feel uncomfortable and the\nfirst step in that direction is just\nlooking maybe at yourself showing up for\nyourself in that much more visceral\nvisual even way before we can expect\nthat deep rooted change because it is a\njourney and you know what i would\nrecommend if you can't look at yourself\nis look away but still do the high five\nbecause i want you to leverage\nthe programming in your brain we had a\nwoman write to us who had uh been\nstruggling with this morphia for 20\nyears\nhad not looked at herself in a mirror in\n20 years\nand she started with a high five looking\naway and it took less than five days\nfor her to be able to turn toward\nherself\nbecause the rejection programming was\nbeing silenced and there was a door\nopening up that allowed for the high\nfive i believe in you i accept you i'm\nhere with you and she says i can now see\ni don't even see a face\ni see myself\nand it's through that kind of acceptance\nand this is what you talk about all the\ntime like you are not going to heal\nor change your life by beating yourself\nup\nit's only with that first brick of\ncompassion\nyou know this high five habit doesn't\nturn you into a narcissistic jerk\nit actually brings more compassion and\nempathy to your own experience\nand that's the door opening for you to\nlearn how to truly love and accept\nyourself i knew i needed to love myself\ni didn't know how\nand you know the third form of\nresistance is what you and i know so\nwell because we've talked about it a lot\nand this is one that that comes up for\ntons of people and that is unless you've\ndone something\nthat deserves the high five\nlike you've hit the weight\nyou are the size pants your hair looks\ngood you have the money in the bank\nyou're driving the right car you're\ndating the right person you're doing the\nright thing your mom's like whatever it\nis the thing outside of you unless\nthat's happening\nyou don't think you deserve something\nand you know when you flip it and you\nrealize no your life is a marathon\nand we don't stand along the edge of a\nwalkathon in a marathon with our arms\ncrossed and go mile seven\ndo you see the pacer running i'm not\ncheering for you until you get to the\nfinish line and even that i'll see what\nyour ticket looks like no\nwe cheer for people clap for them\nhigh-five them every step of the way\nand that's what you need to be doing to\npropel yourself forward\nyour favorite sports teams they don't\nstart a game by standing with dr nicole\ni saw your last book it really blew you\nknow i don't know how this one's gonna\ngo that's not how you start a game\nyou literally ground down an optimism\nyou ground down in partnership in trust\nand faith\nand then you seal it with this positive\nenergizing gesture that aligns you on\nthat commitment you send yourself into\nyour day that way and the final piece of\nresearch that's really exciting and i\nbet you'll be able to even go deeper on\nthis\nis uh dr amon asked me he said so when\nyou leave the bathroom do you notice\nthat you feel a little more energized\nand i said yeah i'm assuming it's just\nbecause you know it's like hey yeah you\nknow he's gonna be cheesy is that what\nit is and he said no he's like mel\nno\nhe said just what you said about emotion\nand energy\nour nervous systems\nare wired for vitality they have\ncelebratory engine or energy encoded in\nthem and so there are all these gestures\nyou've done forever whether it's\ncelebrating somebody's scoring where you\nraise your hands or crossing the finish\nline or raise your hand hey wait hello\nraise your arms to hug somebody or raise\nyour arms to high five\nthe reason why you feel your vitality\ncome back\nis because your nervous system also\nrecognizes the gesture\nso you get dopamine you get the positive\nprogramming and you get this little\nboost\nof celebratory energy\nthat comes through your system to lift\nyou into the day\nso helpful because you'll when you\nlisten to my work i often drop things\ndown into the nervous system the reason\nwhy most of us are stuck\nliving again going back full circle to\nthis conversation living the habits and\npatterns the adaptations the language\nyou and i were using right based around\nwhat trying to create safety in our\nnervous system and then most of us\nbecome locked as that as a way of being\nthat becomes who we are a constant\nattempt at re-establishing that safety\nthat we never once had our nervous\nsystem and that's why i think i i find\nthis book so profound it's because\nyou're you're integrating the body right\nyou're not saying write an affirmation\nand practice it you're saying let's\nactually get our body involved let's get\nour nervous system let's actually create\nand that is i believe why the high five\nhabit produces right the depth of\nhealing that we're all looking for\nbecause\ni mean of course my my handle here is\nthe holistic psychologist right the need\nfor holistic healing is in my opinion\nhere and given you know everyone on this\nlive right here i think we're all aware\nthat we are in a body and that for many\nof us it's our body that's keeping us\nstuck and it's our body that holds the\nthe key\nto to create the healing to allow us to\nheal so what i find so profound is not\nonly are you giving a practical tool i\ncan't tell you mal i don't know if\nyou've been reading the comments there's\nso many people resonating relating with\ndifferent aspects of our journey into\nhealing and healing so the relatableness\nthe understandableness now here you've\ngiven us an action plan each morning no\nmatter how uncomfortable it is no matter\nhow deep rooted that unworthiness is\neven if you know don't even know yet\nwhere that came from you don't have to\nand that's what i find so impactful too\nhealing can begin now it can begin in\nthis next moment the next time you go\nsee a mirror and what we're doing in\nthat moment is so profound again because\nwe're entering our body into the\nequation and you have now a way to shift\nour body's energy and to create actually\nchange from the bottom up which is in my\nopinion how healing actually occurs so\nwhere can we find your book talk to me i\nhave a ton of people i'm actually seeing\nthat have jumped on that have ordered if\nyou don't yet wow\nmel robbins high five habit\nwhere can we grab a copy you can get it\nanywhere you want and honestly i also\ntell you i am reading the book\ncover to cover\nevery day for 15 minutes until we get\nthrough it on instagram and facebook\nbecause i know there's so many people\nwho can't afford a book right now oh how\nincredible okay\nfor me this is a vehicle\nfor you to empower yourself i may have\ncreated it but it's powered by you\nto empower yourself because like you so\neloquently said it is taking your body's\nwisdom\nand the the the\nprogramming that you've encoded over a\nlifetime of giving this\nto other people and you're aiming it\nback at yourself you're unlocking\nsomething that's already in there\nto help you heal to help you flip\nbetween the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic nervous system to help\nyou\nfeel yourself going\nlow when you get jealous or you start\ncomparison or you feel insecure\nand it's giving you a way to come back\nand locate\nall of that strength and power back\nwithin yourself and i know you talk\nabout this all the time too because\nthat relationship that you have with\nyourself it's the foundation of every\nrelationship that you have\nand what's amazing is that when you feel\nsecure with yourself\nit doesn't matter what somebody else\nsays because they can't say anything\nthat won't make you feel\nless secure if you love yourself if\nsomebody stops loving you yes it hurts\nbut it won't impact whether or not you\nlove yourself\nif you like yourself for real and you\nsupport yourself if somebody's a jerk to\nyou\nthat's okay it doesn't impact the fact\nthat you still like yourself\nand so knowing that you have a way to\ncome back into your body to come back\nand connect with yourself to support\nyourself through the ups and downs that\nis everyday life\nthat's the most incredible thing in the\nworld and so you can get the book\nanywhere i'll read it to you for free\nover the next month and a half online\nevery day\nand um we're doing a free high a five\nday challenge called the high five\nchallenge that starts october 4th it's\nwith a bill bazillion awesome inspiring\nfolks dr nicole's amazing for letting me\ntalk about this here i really appreciate\nit but it's literally just five days\nwe've already got gosh i don't know\nwe're getting close to 40 000 people\nsigned up from around the world\nyes and it is just five days of you\ngetting coaching on breaking through\nsome of the doubts and fears that hold\nyou back\nwe go way deep into the science on this\nyou get journaling prompts and more\nimportantly you get a community of\npeople that are going to be cheering you\nforward i'm gonna my commitment is to\nlaunch you so high you need a parachute\nto get your feet back on the ground\ni love that i love that and speaking of\ncommunity i mean your community is so\namazing that's i believe seeing on lives\nlike this right hearing you and i talk\nshare our story just seeing the\nresonance um those of us who who do show\nup you know and do share i i urge\neveryone to do that because i believe\nit's when we share our stories when we\nsee the humanity when i like i said i've\nwatched innumerable people say wow this\nis me right yeah you and i are on the\nscreen right now though we're human too\nand a lot of the experiences can help\ninform others so i love how vulnerably\nyou've always shared your journey how\nyou share so much of your journey in the\nhigh five habit\nit's just such an incredible aspect i\nthink of healing for all of us because\nlike you said we all\nwant relationships and until we really\nare truly in relationship with ourself\nuntil we can empower ourselves to\nnavigate our day-to-day life in an\nempowered way because like we said at\nthe beginning life happens things\noutside of our control happen on a\nday-to-day basis so where we can gain\ncontrol is how do we show up and can i\nstay connected to myself secure in\nmyself and trusting of myself even if\nthe world around me isn't showing up in\nthose ways and i could not agree with\nyou more that that happens when we\nre-establish the relationship with\nourselves when we begin to first shift\ninto that right accepting compassionate\nmode which then over time will allow us\nto become that cheerleader that so many\nof us so readily show up for everyone\nelse\nwe can actually look at ourself in that\nmirror and then\nshift into that acceptance that love so\nthank you thank you thank you like i\nsaid i i was so taken by your work so\ni'm so happy that i have my hands now on\na hard copy i am such an incredible fan\nof of you and your journey and your work\nand how freely you share with the world\nhearing you're reading this um that just\nis so amazing so thank you mal like i\nsaid at the beginning you've inspired me\non so many personal levels and i feel\nvery connected to you so it's been such\nan honor to support you and your new\nadventure so thank you for your time and\nyour energy and to clarify i saw a\nmillion questions this will be saved\nthis will be up on my igtv i know a lot\nof people tuned in halfway or maybe want\nto revisit your wisdom again so an\nabsolute yes this is not going anywhere\ni would never dare think of it so this\nwill live on my instagram and i'm\nsending you so much love mel as you can\ncontinue to navigate the rest of your\nbook launch week because i know all of\nthe craziness that goes along with that\nand thank you for carving up the time\nfor us today thank you for carving out\nthe time i love you i see you i support\nyou\nhigh five baby right back at you high\nfive mel have a good challenge everybody"
