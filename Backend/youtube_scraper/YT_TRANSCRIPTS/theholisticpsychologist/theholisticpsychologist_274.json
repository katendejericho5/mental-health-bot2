    "transcript": "this video will cover how to know when\nyou're an ego mind\nwe'll explore what ego mind is and then\nof course how to identify when you're\nshifted into that state\nto understand ego mind we first have to\nunderstand what the ego is\nso our ego is our i identity it's all of\nthe repeated narratives that we tell\nourselves about who we think we are our\nplace in the world our past our future\nthey really go on all of these\nnarratives of course are based in our\nlived experiences originating in\nchildhood however because our ego lives\nin our subconscious mind it continues to\nact as a filter for our current\nexperiences even beyond that childhood\ntime well of course into adulthood for\nmost of us so what is ego mind\nego mind is a state of consciousness\nthat we shift into when we believe that\nour ego or our story of us this identity\nthat our ego has created is threatened\nhere are some signs to know when you are\nin that state of threat or you're in\nyour own ego mind\none of the signs is you have a strong\noverall attachment to your identities to\nyour beliefs they quite literally become\nwho you think you are in a very limited\nway\nanother sign you're an ego mind is that\nyou then have a related tendency to take\ndiffering opinions differing beliefs\nvery personally because remember this\nidentity this belief whatever it might\nbe is who you are so you shift into a\nstate of defensiveness when someone else\nis presenting an opinion to the contrary\nanother sign that you're an ego mind\nis you often see yourself making\nconstant attempts to gain love to gain\napproval through external means through\nyour accomplishments through rewards\nthrough displays or gestures of love\nfrom somebody else it's an over reliance\nagain on that external validation\nanother sign that you're an ego\nconsciousness is you see yourself\nconsistently judging or shaming or\ncriticizing not only yourself a lot of\ntimes this happens in our own minds a\nlot of us then extend that judgment to\nothers to people that we know personally\nmaybe even to strangers on the internet\nanother sign you're in ego mind is that\nsimilar tendency to compare where you\nsee words like should or shouldn't in\nyour mind and again or can or can't i\ncan do these things this person can't do\nthese things\noverall it's this tendency to separate\nthings to be very rigid very black and\nwhite no room for gray and again a lot\nof thought the tendency to be lost in\nthought in general or lost in\nanalyzation and again when we're over\nanalyzing often what we're doing is\ncomparing ourself to ourself in the past\nor maybe to others around us\nso how do we begin to do the work\nawareness happens when we're able to\nidentify when we're in our ego mind\nbecause when we're in our ego mind again\nwe're reacting from a state of threat or\nwhat we believe to be a state of threat\noftentimes we're saying we're doing\nthings that we don't really mean at our\ncore\nso the work begins when you're able to\nidentify those moments when you're\nseeing your own ego mind show up in your\nown life i know for me my ego mind is\nstill very present in my healing journey\nwhen my resources are low when i'm\nstressed out when i'm not sleeping well\ni see that same old stories in my own\nmind coming up on repeat shifting me\ninto similar states of defensiveness or\nreactivity again not really reflecting\nwhat i really mean at my core\nso i'd love to hear from you out there\nanyone who's been practicing this\nawareness around their ego or their ego\nmind i'd love to hear when you see your\nego mind most active and also for those\nof you who this is a new concept i'd\nlove to hear your thoughts i'll be\nchecking out the comments below"
