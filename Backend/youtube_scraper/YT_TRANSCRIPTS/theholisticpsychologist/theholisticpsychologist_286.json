    "transcript": "this video\nwe're going to talk a little bit about\ntrauma trauma historically is a label\nthat has been applied to an event\nevents in particular that have crossed a\ncertain threshold\none might call them catastrophic events\nthese events\ninstances of physical verbal sexual\nabuse or neglect\nactive substance use or incarceration\nhave been known to cause\nemotional and physical symptoms well\nbeyond the event itself\nit wasn't until the 90s a groundbreaking\nresearch study\nexplored these effects in something\nthat's called the adverse\nchildhood experiences study this showed\nthat these moments\nthese catastrophic events in our\nchildhood carried symptoms with it\nwell beyond childhood into our adulthood\nthe reason being these events cause an\noverwhelm to our minds and our\nbodies we now understand however\nthat many experiences beyond these\ncatastrophic events\ncause the similar overwhelm it is\nactually the\nindividual's experience or perception\nof the event that affects how we respond\nor react to these moments\nin my version of an expanded definition\nof trauma\nit is actually the consistent stress\nthat many of us face\nwhen our needs our physical needs our\nemotional needs and our spiritual needs\ngo unmet this consistent stress results\nin the same overwhelm\nand often the same symptoms that these\nbig catastrophic\nevents once did so now let's talk a bit\nabout the different experiences in\nchildhood\nthat lead to these same symptoms\nremember when we explore these these are\nevents that happened consistently not\none-offs this is more often than not\nand many of us will see instances of our\npast\nin more than one of these categories\nthose of us who have had a parent figure\nwho denies\nour reality what this looks like in\nchildhood\nis coming home from school upset and\nbeing told by a parent figure\nthat it wasn't a big deal if this\nhappened consistently the child's\nfeelings of upset\nthat are understandable being rejected\nfrom our peer groups\nbeing hurt at school is very real for a\nchild\nwhen these things happen consistently we\ndefer\nto our parents we begin to believe that\nit wasn't a big deal\nour feelings the more consistently this\nhappens\nthe more we're unconsciously taught to\nignore our own intuition\nlearning that our judgment can't be\ntrusted and ultimately\nlooking to others to shape our reality\nhaving a parent figure who does not see\nor\nhear you this can look like those parent\nfigures who are overwhelmed by their own\nfeelings\nmay be distracted by chronic stress\nor in a complete state of emotional\nshutdown\ni know many of my family members\nfluctuate it to both\nwhen we're not seen and heard when our\nsoul or our essence doesn't have the\nspace to freely\nexpress itself that essence\nbegins to feel diminished and over time\nmany of us\nstop expressing ourselves completely\nhaving a parent figure who vicariously\nlives\nthrough or molds or shapes you\nthe most extreme example of this of\ncourse is the stage parent\nthough more subtle examples include\npushing a child to succeed\nor to become something that would make\nthe parent figure proud\nor even in the parent figure's mind be\nbest for the child the more consistently\nthis happens\nthe more we begin to defer our life\nchoices\nmaking them to gain the love and support\nof others as opposed to making them from\nour authentic self\nor essence having a parent figure\nwho does not model boundaries many of us\nwho have had parent figures who didn't\nmodel or who\nactively violated boundaries this can\nlook like\ngiving a child overwhelming information\npersonal information about the\nother parent could look like reading a\ndiary\nor barging in a room this lack of\nboundary\nresults in a similar lack of boundaries\nin the child\nand often guilt and fear around setting\nnew boundaries or limits\nhaving a parent figure who is overly\nfocused on appearance\nthis can look like parent figures who\nregularly comment\non a child's physical appearance their\nweight their clothing\ntheir self-expression or parent figures\nwho fixate on their\nown appearance modeling excessive\ndieting\nexcessive grooming exercising this can\neven look like parent figures\nwho wear masks in public maybe bickering\nin the home\npleasant to others when in public this\ncan result\nin a similar shape-shifting behavior in\nthe child\nwhere we become appearance driven or\nmotivated\nalways worrying about how we appear to\nthe world around us\nhaving a parent figure who cannot\nregulate their emotions\nthis can look like having parents who\nregularly projected their feelings\noutward screaming yelling slamming doors\nor who withdrew who became silent\niced or withdrew their love and\naffection\nthe more consistently this happens the\nmore as children we begin to lack our\nown emotional resilience\noften seeing these similar coping\nmechanisms in ourselves\nall of these examples i've shared again\nresult in\nsimilar coping mechanisms similar ways\nof being\nthat those big catastrophic events also\ndid\nthese events also result in a version of\ntrauma\nfor our emotional or our spiritual\nselves as children\nand many of us see instances of our past\nor our present in\nsome or many of these experiences this\nis of course a quick\noverview those who are interested in\ngoing deeper into these concepts\ncan check out my new book how to do the\nwork where i talk about these childhood\nexperiences and the impact\nthey continue as well as healing from\nthese moments in our current lives"
