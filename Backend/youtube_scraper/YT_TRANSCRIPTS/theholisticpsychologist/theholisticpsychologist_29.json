    "transcript": "today I want to share the truth about\ndepression depression is something we\ntalk a lot about in our society and most\nof what we're told is that depression is\na disorder that if we're depressed that\nthere's something wrong with us or that\nthere's something that needs to be fixed\nthis really simply is the way that our\nHealth Care system thinks and speaks\nabout depression that it's something to\npathologize but I want to share a\ndifferent model of depression I want to\nshare a model of depression as a\nresponse depression can actually be a\nnatural response to the loss of intimacy\none thing that we're not educated on is\nhow deep our need for emotional intimacy\nis as human beings and the simplest way\nto think about what emotional intimacy\nis it's having the experience of someone\nelse who's curious about you once to\nunderstand your thoughts your emotions\nyour experiences and who's actually able\nto see you\nthis mirroring from another helps us\nfeel a sense of belonging something we\nall deeply need and it actually helps us\nunderstand ourselves better we have so\nmany studies that show how having secure\nrelationships whether they're with\nfriends with families or with Partners\nactually makes us feel more confident\nmore resilient and even more physically\nhealthy but most of the messaging that\nwe receive in our culture is actually\nabout being hyper independent or not\nneeding anyone at all doing it all\nourselves which really goes against our\nmost basic needs as human beings and\nwhen we lose emotional intimacy the loss\nis really intense for us take a minute\nnow and think back maybe to a painful\nbreakup you had maybe it was a\nfriendship that you lost maybe it was\nsomething in childhood maybe you lost a\nparent maybe you lost a grandparent if\nwe didn't have anyone to support us or\nto comfort us these losses can actually\nfeel like a shock in our body we end up\nnot being able to concentrate sometimes\nwe're not able to eat we're not able to\nsleep because our body has gone into a\nfight ORF flight response we feel unsafe\nin reality what is happening in both our\nbody and our mind is that we're grieving\na natural human experience and a lot of\ntimes this grief especially if it goes\non for a long period of time ends up\nbeing labeled as depression so here's a\nreally common cycle that some of us go\nthrough we might experience some type of\nloss of connection maybe even a\nrejection we perceive that we're being\nrejected by someone that's important to\nus as a result we end up really\nunderstandably feeling hopeless maybe we\neven feel shameful our body in this\nmoment is actually going into a freeze\nState we begin to isolate we don't have\nany energy to connect sometimes we're\ndoing this as a way to soothe our\noverwhelming\nfeelings this now sense of disconnection\nus being separate from people a lot of\ntimes ends up being misinterpreted by\nSociety Society doesn't understand what\ngrief is doesn't understand how to\nsupport people when they're grieving\nultimately leading to more Bel\ndisconnection and so the cycle continues\nso if you're listening and you're\nfeeling depressed right now as a lot of\nyou are the most helpful step you can\nbegin to take for yourself is treat\nyourself with compassion and\nunderstanding around how you're feeling\nso whether you've lost an important\nrelationship or maybe you're like me and\nyou just grw up always feeling\ndisconnected take a moment to begin to\nfeel in your body where your feelings of\nsadness and grief might live maybe you\nmight feel a heaviness in your belly or\na tightness in your\nshoulders it is very normal to feel\nhowever you're feeling when you've\nexperienced a loss of connection and it\nis so important for you to develop the\nability to be patient with yourself\nwithout judgment and without shame as\nyou become present to all of the\nemotions inside of you so that you can\nfinally allow yourself to fully grieve\ni' love to hear from you in the comments\nhave you found yourself suck in this\ncycle have you sensed that maybe your\ndepression is actually grief I'd love to\nhear your journey below"
