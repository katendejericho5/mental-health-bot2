    "transcript": "All right, so I have a special\nguest here with us today I am\nsuper excited to introduce Dr.\nSusan David. So Dr. Susan David\nis a renowned psychologist and\nexpert on emotions, happiness\nand achievement. Her number one,\nWall Street Journal best selling\nbook, emotional agility provides\npractical tools. We love our\npractical tools here to help us\nnavigate our inner worlds our\neveryday thoughts, emotions and\nself stories. This is the single\nmost important determinant. So\nSusan believes myself included\nof our life's success. After you\nlisten to this video, you might\nwant to check out Susan's\namazing TED talk, and join the\nmillions of others around the\nworld who have listened to her\nspeak on her concept of\nemotional agility. So welcome,\nSusan, thank you so much for\nsharing your time and energy\nwith us here today.\nThank you, I'm so delighted to\nbe with you.\nWe're super excited to hear from\nyou. So I think a good starting\npoint. Because I know in my\nwork, I see and hear these these\nmyths as I like to call them\naround our emotions that a lot\nof us believe to be true. And I\nthink one of the predominant\nones that I'm up against a lot\nin terms of the work is this\nidea that stress or that\nnegative feelings, you know, in\ntheir entirety are something\nthat should be avoided. And any\nof us who have stress in our\nlives or who feel negative\nexperiences or emotions are\nsomehow wrong or bad that\nultimately the goal is to avoid\nthese such things. So wanted to\nhear a little bit from you on\nwhat you make of this idea. Why\nis it that so many of us believe\nthat stress is to be avoided?\nAnd what is your actual belief\nin terms of what stress and what\nthe role of it is, in our day to\nday lives?\nSo let's start off with the\nbasis of the question, which I\nthink is so important, which is\nthis idea of difficult emotions.\nAnd stress might be one of those\nexperiences, but we have such a\nfull range of emotions. And some\nof these are, you know, not\nnecessarily about stress, but\nthings like sadness or guilt or,\nyou know, feelings of\ndiscomfort. And what's happened\nreally socially. And there's a\nlong history to this is that\nthese emotions have become seen\nas negative. And therefore, bat.\nAnd there are a number of\nreasons for this. You know, I\ndescribed a little bit in my\nwork about how when I was doing\nmy PhD on this topic, it was\nactually like extraordinarily\ndifficult for me to get an\nadvisor, who would advise me in\nwork on emotions, which is\nbizarre, because this is in a\npsychology department. Because\neven at that time, emotions were\nseen as almost like either\ndisruptive, or the byproduct or\nend product of our experience.\nAnd what I mean by that is that\nif we got everything else,\nright, in terms of our thoughts,\nand in terms of our actions,\nthat our emotions would kind of\nsort themselves out. And really,\nyou know, part of the the\nhistory that we see of almost\nmaligning emotions is in\npsychology. But we also see this\nin society more broadly. You\nknow, this idea that emotions,\nespecially tough emotions are\nassociated with being\nirrational, they've become\nfeminized, and this is\nextraordinarily destructive. So\nfrom a psychological\nperspective, we know that our\nemotions have evolved, all of\nour emotions have evolved to\nhelp us to adapt. So when we are\nexperiencing something that\nfeels disconnected with our\nvalues, or disconnected with who\nwe want to be in our lives, we\nwill often have difficult\nemotions. And when we then see\nthese emotions as being, oh,\nthese are distractions, these\nare negative, I've got to be\npositive, what we actually do is\nwe shut ourselves off from the\nlearning and the value that\ncomes from those difficult\nemotions. So in in short order,\nwhat we do when we close\nourselves off from difficult\nemotions, is we actually close\nthe door to our ability to adapt\nand thrive in our lives. And so,\none of the core aspects of my\nwork is really speaking to this\nidea that tough emotions are\nactually part of our contract\nwith life. We don't get to have\na meaningful career or to raise\na family or to leave the world a\nbetter place without stress and\ndiscomfort. You know, the\ndiscomfort is actually the price\nof admission. To a meaningful\nlife. And so this is really the\nfoundational to my work and what\nwhat you know, and I know we've\nwe share this idea in many ways\nis that what this really pushes\nup against is avoidance of\ndifficult emotions, but also\nsystemic avoidance of difficult\nemotions that can often find its\nway through in, you know, what\nhas come to be called toxic\npositivity, you know, this idea\nthat, like, you've just got to\nbe positive. It is profoundly\nerosive of our individual well\nbeing and our community well\nbeing when we are not able to\nengage effectively with\ndifficult emotions.\nYeah, absolutely. And this idea,\nI'm happy you're bringing this\nup, you know, toxic positivity,\nspiritual bypassing, really\ninterestingly, I had a giggle,\nSusan, and I'm sure it's not a\njoking matter when you're\nsharing your your time in grad\nschool, trying to get someone\ndesperately to help you do the\nresearch on around emotions,\nsharing obviously, a very\nsimilar experience myself and\nmine was around when I was at\nthat time, at work, trying to to\nadvocate that was the word I was\ntrying to find advocate for what\nI believed was to be the\nutilitarian value of mindfulness\nof applicable approaches around\nemotional experiences awareness\nof our emotions. So somewhat\nsimilar, though, again, I was\nvery much told at that time,\nthat that wasn't a fruitful area\nof research, which is mind\nblowing, and brings us to, I\nthink, in the field kind of as,\nas a whole, our beliefs. And\nthis is emblematic in the gold\nstandard of treatment, which is\nCBT, this idea, right, that if\nwe just change our thoughts\nenough, we can reframe our\ncomplete emotional experiences,\nlike you're offering become\nstress free, because it's to be\navoided. And I see that at the\nsystem level, in terms of how\nthe field is, is is orchestrated\nwith that being the top\nprotocol, those of us in the\nfield and as you know, clinic,\nclients in the field, as well\ncome to see that that doesn't\nnecessarily work. And I also see\nthis in individuals, those of us\nwho, you know, maybe at times,\nin our past experiences have had\nemotions that have felt\ndebilitating, or the word that\ncomes up a lot in my community\noverwhelming. So I think we have\ntwo roads where we do get\nmessages. One is the the\nsystemic road where we're taught\ndirectly or indirectly, that\nsome feelings are to be avoided,\nor are a marker that something\nis wrong with us. And then we\nhave the individual pathway, or\nsome of us very real lived\nexperiences of being overwhelmed\nby our own emotions in the past,\ndo then seek to avoid them out\nof likely fear or some version\nof, you know, discomfort of what\nwill happen if I'm overwhelmed\nagain. So I think that's what's\nreally important here. I'd love\nto hear your thoughts on kind of\nthe individual pathway, because\nI do think sometimes we, we have\nhad emotionally overwhelming\nexperiences that we seek to\navoid into a future.\nAbsolutely. And I think that\nit's a it's a both end. And\nreally what I mean by this is,\nso many of our responses to our\nindividual emotions, and to our\nindividual lived experience are\nalso conveyed by what is called\na display rules. So you know,\ndisplay rules are the rules that\noften implicitly, and sometimes\nexplicitly converted people,\nthis emotion is okay and not\nokay. And so what can that can\nlead people into doing is almost\nbeing in a kind of emotional\nHouse of mirrors, where not only\nare you now experiencing the\nemotion, but you are also not\nable to extricate yourself from\nthis very real messaging that\nexists around emotions. And I'll\ngive you an example of like what\nthis looks like. And it's\nactually very interesting,\nhistorically, when we think\nabout these ideas, because we\nspoke about them within\npsychology. But there's, there's\na fairly interesting body of\nresearch looking at the gendered\nideas that come about around\nemotions, and how you know, if\nyou think about education, and\nhow education historically was\ntraditionally open to males, and\nwhat could be taught in, excuse\nme, and what could be taught in\nformal education was logic,\nstrategy, mathematics sciences.\nSo then what becomes associated\nwith the intangible stuff, the\nfeminine stuff is the part of\neducation that's not open to\nwomen. And so what happens is\nfemininity, emotion, emotions\nget connected in this way. And\nso what you learn up then having\nis this really interesting a\nnarrative in society that finds\nits way into the in Individual,\nwhich is that emotions are\nlogical. They are the good\nemotions and bad emotions that\nbe avoided. And then what\nhappens as we start connecting\nin with generational experiences\nand generational trauma is how\nthese disparities find their way\ninto families. Where your very\nreal experience as a child of\nmaybe being unseen, or of having\nsomething that feels really\ndifficult to you, is met with a\nresponse, often by a caregiver\nor parent that says something\nlike, you know, if you keep\ncrying, I'll give you something\nto cry about. That's says, If\nyou feel angry, go to your room\nand come out when you've got a\nsmile on your face. That says,\nWhen you feel sad, we don't do\nsadness. Yeah, we, you know all\nabout joy and happiness. And so\nwhat happens is, we start to\nlearn through our childhoods,\nhow to develop skills around\ndifferent emotions. And so I\nthink that this idea that there\nis this individual\nresponsiveness is really\nprofoundly important. And it's\nalso important to recognize that\nwe actually have our own display\nrules that have often developed\nfrom when we were very young,\nthat lead us into situations\nwhere we experience something,\nand we then Gaslight ourselves,\nwe tell ourselves, we're not\nallowed to experience it. And so\nthis is what I mean by the\nemotional House of mirrors. And\nso psychologically, what happens\nis, I often think of this\nlanguage, and I describe this in\nemotional agility, this idea\nthat, we can often have a type\none emotion, and the type one\nemotion is the overwhelm, it's\nthe stress, it's the disconnect,\nit's the sadness, then what we\ndo is we layer on a type two\nemotion, I shouldn't feel sad\nabout my sadness. And that is\nthat is where we start engaging\nin this vortex with ourselves.\nThat takes us away from our\nvalues, and our thriving and our\nflourishing and ourselves. And\ninstead leads us into a constant\nhustle with whether we are\nallowed or not allowed to feel something.\nYes, vortex, I mean, I keep kind\nof repeating that word, because\nI just think it, it is so so\nappropriate to use right here.\nAnd a big part of the reason why\nI've been advocating and you\nknow, I love your work, because\nit's very much aligned with\nthis, which is really honoring\nthe individual's experience of\nwhatever the thing is. And\nhistorically, in the field, we\nwere, we were taught to\ncategorize experiences based on\nthe thing itself, if it reached\na certain threshold, we could\nlabel something that happened,\nquote, unquote, traumatic, bad\nenough to cause negative\nconsequences to the self,\nthough, the reality is, it's not\nness, in my opinion, at least\nit's not necessarily a function\nof the thing anymore. It's how\ndid this individual experience\nthe thing? Did they have the\nresources or were they again,\nfallen into a state of\noverwhelm, and this allows for\nmuch more of us now, to honor\nthe effects that for many of us\nwere wounding moments in\nchildhood that happened\nconsistently where sometimes our\nfeelings wholly or only certain\naspects of our feelings weren't\nallowed the light of day or to\nbe expressed, we continue down\nthat vortex long enough. And we\ndo end up as an adult who's\ncompletely more often than not\ndisconnected from the self in a\nvery deep way. I call this a\nversion of trauma because I do\nthink that the way that we\nattempt to cope to deal with\nthat vortex like you're saying\nendlessly spiraling, exhausting\nourselves does carry very real\ntrauma to the emotional into the\nphysical bodies. And I love that\naspect of your work. So talk to\nme about I think this is where\nwe insert this concept of\nemotional agility. So stress is\na part of life, feelings have\nadaptive, you know, messages for\nmessengers for us are our\nadaptive messengers for us. Tell\nus a little bit about you know,\nwhat then emotional agility\nmeans, and ultimately, what it\nlooks like in our day to day life.\nSo thank you. I think that's\nsuch a powerful question. You\nknow, and one of the things that\nyou speak about earlier is how\nwe can become disconnected with\nthe self. And often what this\ncan look like as an alliance\nwithin connects with emotional\nagility is, on the one hand, we\nhave difficult thoughts and\nfeelings, and we push them\naside. So We say things like,\nI'm not able, I'm not allowed to\nhave those difficult thoughts\nand feelings. And that in a very\nobvious way takes us away from\nthe self. But another way we can\nmove away from the self is by\ngetting so stuck in our\ndifficult thoughts and feelings.\nBy becoming so immersed so so\nthe, the pushing away from is\nwhat I call bottling they're\ngetting stuck in is this idea of\nbrooding that we get so stuck in\nwhat our experience is, that we,\nwe develop a story around it,\nand the story starts to own us.\nAnd it starts to hook us and we\nare so in the story, we so\nimmersed in the story, that we\nare also disconnected from\nourselves, because we are more\nthan our story. We are also our\nwisdom, I believe that every\nsingle one of us has inside of\nus the capacity for wisdom and\ncalm and centeredness. We are\nour values. We are who we want\nto be in the moment. And so when\nwe get stuck in the story, be\ncoming definitional of who we\nare where it starts to own us,\nwe also start to move away from\nus from ourselves in a very\ndifferent way. And so what is\nemotional agility, perhaps a\ngood way to describe emotional\nagility is by its opposite,\nwhich is emotional rigidity.\nEmotional rigidity is the idea\nthat we have these difficult\nthoughts. I'm not good enough.\nemotions, emotions of sadness\nare feelings of disconnect. And\nsometimes these stories, these\nstories about who we are, what\nkind of life we deserve, what\nkind of love we deserve. And I\nthink what's really crucial in\nmy work is the idea that these\nthoughts, emotions, and stories\nare actually normal. Okay. And\nreally, what I mean by that is\nthat there's nothing inherently\nwrong or bad about any thought,\nemotional story. Fundamentally,\nthese capacities are capacities\nthat help us as human beings to\nmake sense of the world. When I\nhave an emotion that says, this\nfeels really bad, that emotion\nis often saying to me, this has\nrelevance to you, this might be\nimportant here, maybe you want\nto pay attention. So there's\nnothing inherently good or bad\nabout any thoughts, emotions, or\nstories. And I think this is\nwhere my work really pushes\nagainst this idea that if you\nhave a so called negative\nthought, you've got to push it\naside. Or if you have a so\ncalled negative emotion, now\nsuddenly, you're a toxic person.\nAnd, you know, you're You\nmustn't engage with, you know,\nthese thoughts, these emotions,\nthese throws on normal. So what\ndefines emotional rigidity is\nwhen we start hooking into one\nof these ideas or stories, in a\nway that leads to become\ndefinitional of us. In other\nwords, it starts to own us,\nrather than we as human beings\nas these wise, capacious\nbreathing, beautiful, messy\nhuman beings, rather than we\nowning it. So what that can look\nlike is emotional rigidity is\nwhen by default, you avoid\nparticular triggers. Those\ntriggers are difficult for you,\nbut you become avoidant of\nwhether it's a you know, a set\nof experiences like thinking\nabout what starts to happen, and\nthat is, it sounds empowering.\nBut actually what you do is you\nsystematically shrink your world\nand we don't become capacious\npeople. If we have a shrunken\nworld, we don't become capacious\npeople, if we are only able to\nrespond to a but not be. We\nbecome capacious people when we\ndevelop our capacity to be in\nthe world as it is, which is a\nfragile, imperfect, messy world.\nSo one form of emotional\nrigidity is avoidance.\nAnother form of emotional\nrigidity is an autopilot where\nwe just kind of I know this\nconnects a lot with your work,\nwhere we going through our lives\nin a days where we have\nsomething that we respond To in\nthe same way, time and time\nagain, our partner starts in the\nfinances leave the room, we have\na difficult conversation with\nour children, we have this\nautopilot response which is\nshutting down becoming negative\nstonewalling. This is crucial.\nThis is crucial because as we\nspoke about earlier, Nicole,\nsome many of the stories that we\nhave tell us that we should not\nbe compassionate with ourselves\nthat we should be punishing of\nourselves. And so being\ncompassionate with yourself is\nreally about saying, This is\ntough. This is messy, I'm moving\ninto a space of discomfort and a\nspace of potential growth. And I\ncan't avoid it. But it is\ndifficult it is. This is human\nand it's tough. So compassion is\na core part of emotional\nagility. Another core core core\npart of emotional agility is the\ncapacity to be curious. Why\ncurious, because so often when\nwe have had a challenging\nexperience, we also have a\nautopilot response to that\nexperience, we'll push it aside,\nwe'll engage with it in a\nparticular way, we'll find\nourselves telling the same story\ntime and time again, in an\nautopilot way. And so curiosity\nis really about starting to say\nlike, I'm experiencing,\nexperiencing a difficult emotion\nhere, what does this emotion\ntelling me about my values? What\nis this emotion telling me\nabout? Something that's\nhappening at work, where I'm\nfeeling undermined? And so my\nautopilot response is to just\nshut down and be quiet. But my\nvalues here of the discomfort,\nlike what is the value that this\ndiscomfort is pointing in the\ndirection of, Oh, I'm feeling\nuncomfortable because my voice\nis being silenced. So what is\nthe value that that emotion is\npointing to? And this is key,\nour emotions are signposts of\nthe things that we care. And I'm\ngoing to say that again, our\nemotions, signpost, the things\nthat we care about. So when we\nexperience a difficult emotion,\ndoesn't mean every difficulty\nmotion is signposting. But often\nwhen we experience difficult\nemotions, they signpost, that\nsomething we care about is at\nstake. So if you're feeling shut\ndown in a meeting, that might be\nsignposting that you value\nvoice, that you value your\nvoice, that for too long, your\nvoice has been unheard. And so\nif you can connect into that\nemotion, with compassion and\ncuriosity, you can then start\nconnecting with the third core\ncomponent of emotional agility,\nwhich is courage. How do I move\nforward in this context with\ncourage. And so I'll just end by\ngiving a very quick definition\nof emotional agility, which is\nemotional agility is, in\nessence, the ability to be with\nall of our difficult thoughts,\nemotions, and stories in ways\nthat bring us into the present\ncontext. So that the emotion of\nthe story isn't defining how we\nreact in that moment, but\nrather, other parts of ourselves\nare allowed to come forward. And\nwe're allowed to allow ourselves\nto move forward with courage.\nAnd so what this really means is\nthat these thoughts, emotions,\nand stories are data. But\nthey're not directives. Because\nI feel something difficult\ndoesn't mean I have to act on it\ndoesn't mean I need to avoid the\nsituation doesn't mean I need to\nhave it out with my boss.\nRather, they are data, not\ndirectives. So when we curious\nwith our difficult emotions, we\ncan learn from them. But what\nare we doing we are not being\ndirected by those emotions, the\nemotions on calling the shots.\nRather what we are doing is we\nare stepping into our values. We\nare saying in this moment in\nthis meeting in this\nconversation, what is the values\nconnected way that I can\ncourageously bring myself\nforward? So in other words,\nagain, you aren't acting into\nthe overwhelm.\nRather, what you're doing is\nyou're starting to say what is\nthis overwhelmed telling me once\nI've comments of about what's\nimportant here, and how can I\nstep into the value that is\nbeing signaled?\nAnd I think this this last part,\nyou know, acknowledging the\nstepping into it, You know,\nagain highlights the need to\nembody in new experience, right?\nIt's not just enough to imagine\nor to think differently in those\nmoments right to shift from that\nreactivity that lives in, as I\nsay, the autopilot, right. And\nall of these ways that we have\noperated on outside of our\nawareness to keep us either\nstuffed as our go to right or\nbrooding even for some of us as\nour go to. We are familiar in\nthere, and we're stuck. And we\nlike to just stay in there as\nhuman. So the way out often or\nalways, is doing things\ndifferently now in that space.\nSo even the actioning, of\nbecoming compassionate, becoming\ncurious, becoming courageous our\nways of being. And I think\nthat's the important shift.\nThat's what emotional agility\nactually means is learning how\nto operationalize a new way\naround our emotions, how to be\nwith them how to compassionately\ntake the information, and then\nreground ourselves into our\nvalues to be able to action in a\nnew way. And I keep highlighting\nall of these different forms of\nactioning. Because I believe for\na lot of us, we're stuck. We're\nstuck with increasing amounts of\ninsight. We might even know why\nwe brewed the way we do, where\nwe avoid our emotions the way we\ndo, yet, we're still stuck doing\nit the way we do. And what's so\nvaluable about your work. And so\nincredibly important is how\npractical you talk about, okay,\nwell how do I begin, I begin to\ncultivate curiosity and\ncompassion, knowing that those\nare actions, that's a new\nrelationship now that I need to\nembody with my feelings,\nlearning how to see them for\nwhat they are. And I just keep\nlike to highlight that, because\nagain, that disempowerment of\nhaving all of the insight of\nknowing why our patterns are the\nway they are, and not being able\nto actually develop emotional\nagility, for instance, is\nincredibly disempowering,\npowerless place to be. And this\nis actually the way we can\nempower ourselves to navigate\nthe ever changing uncertainty of\nlife, because that's what it\nremains. We don't actually know\nwhat comes tomorrow, we need\nthat agility to lie within so\nthat we can navigate the\nunknown.\nYeah, and I think that this is\nwhen people ask me like, Well,\nyou know, does your work connect\nwith resilience? there? Maybe\nthey, you know, they, then\nthey're certainly, and I can\ngive some practical strategies\naround this as if this is\nhelpful, but certainly, you\nknow, yes, you know, if you're\nmore able to be effective with\nyour emotions, you will be more\nresilient. If you more able to\nunhook from difficult\nexperiences, you'll be more\nresilient. But emotional agility\nis much more than that, because\nemotional agility is actually\nabout. I've used this word\npreviously in our conversation\ntoday, but it's about developing\nthe capriciousness as a human\nbeing the the open heartedness\nas a human being to walk forward\ninto the dock. Rather than just\ngo, oh, my goodness, where's the\nlight? How can I switch on the\nlight? So to me, resilience is\nlike often about saying, How can\nI switch on the light, whereas\nemotional agility is about\nsaying, the world is is\nuncertain? How can I have the\nskills that move me forward in\nthe dark and, you know, you\ndescribed so powerfully, I think\nthe practical aspects of my\nwork, which is, I think, if I\nhad to really define the thread\nof my work, and you'll see this\nin my TED talk that you refer to\nearlier, which is, my work is at\nessence about how we can better\nsee ourselves how we can better\nsee ourselves and see others.\nIt's very difficult to see\nyourself effectively, and to\nrespond effectively. When you\nare stuck inside the jar. You\nknow, you can't read the\ninstructions when you stuck\ninside the jar. And so, a lot of\nmy work is, firstly about what\nare the capacities around how\nyou develop self compassion?\nLike how do you actually connect\nwith yourself, you know, even\njust as I'm sitting here,\nthinking, you know, we are such\ntactile human beings. And there\nis such power. When we're\nfeeling overwhelmed in chest,\nyou know, you can see I'm\nputting my hands to my chest.\nJust grounding ourselves in a\ntactile way, is a way that we\nare compassionate. So there are\nways that we can start showing\nup to our emotions in in very\npractical ways. We can also stop\nstart to step out of our\ndifficult emotions step out of\nour stories. And I can give two\nexamples of what this looks like\nif you think this would be a value,\nplease. Yes.\nSo one example that I'll\nreference is just part of my\nwork is about emotion\ngranularity. So emotion\ngranularity is this idea that\noften when we experience\nsomething difficult, we'll\ndescribe it with these very big\nlabels. So we'll say I'm\noverwhelmed. Or we'll say I'm\nstressed. But there's a world of\ndifference between stress and\ndisappointment, stress and that\nknowing knowing feeling that a\nrelationship isn't working out.\nstress and the need for support,\nstress, and I'm just tired, I'm\ndepleted. When we label\neverything as stress or\noverwhelm, what we do is we put\nall of these difficult emotions\ninto a bucket, and we then store\naround that bucket, but we are\nunable to actually take\neffective action. So one of the\nmost powerful ideas is this idea\nthat when we become more\ngranular, granular with our\nemotions, when we say, I'm\ncalling this thing stress, I'm\ncalling it overwhelm. But what\nare two other emotions? What are\ntwo other options that are\ncoming up for me here? Oh, I'm\ndisappointed. Oh, I'm feeling\nunseen. What you're starting to\ndo is the very essence, the act\nof moving from the umbrella\nlabel into what are two other\noptions. What it literally does\nis it changes what in\npsychological terms, we'll call\nthe readiness capacity of us as\nhuman beings, you know, when you\nstart to say, I'm stressed at\nwork, oh, my goodness, like we,\nyou know, whereas when you say,\nI'm feeling unsupported.\nAlready, that act of labeling\nthat emotion or that experiences\nunsupported, starts activating\nwhat scientists call the\nreadiness potential in our\nbrains this ability to say,\nOkay, how do I get more support?\nOr how do I have that\nconversation with my friend? How\ndo I broach this difficult topic\nwith my loved one. So emotion\ngranularity is foundational in\nour ability to actually be able\nto take effective action to be\nable to get out of the job. So\nthis is what I call being able\nto not ignore the emotion but to\nstep out of it. So that's one\none example of something that's\nvery practical. Not, you know,\nsorry, did you want to,\nI was giggling, too, because I\nwant to thank you for that\nexample. Because I'm someone who\nloves to throw historically,\neverything into the stress\nbucket. And I've learned to how\nto differentiate sometimes I'm\nnot even stressed, I'm excited,\nsometimes I have a lot of things\nto do. And they're not\nnecessarily negative things. So\nas I historically just kept\nthrowing everything into the\nstress bucket, I didn't give\nmyself any opportunity to solve\nperhaps what was maybe solvable,\nsuch as not scheduled, so many\nappointments, get a little more\nsleep, if it is an exhausted,\nI'm tired. So for me, that was\nthat was integral advice to\nlearn that I am someone who just\ndumped everything into that\ncatch all and that did not\nactually let me understand the\nproblem or my concern in\nreality, and it didn't really\ngive me a way out. And now that\nI've been able to get a little\nmore to use your language\ngranular, I've been able to\nactually open the door for newer\nsolutions, how to solve the\nproblem that was once so big,\nbecause it was amorphous, it was\njust stress. Who knows what to\ndo with that into something that\nfor me felt more manageable. So\nthe whole while you were\ntalking, I was like, Okay, well,\nshe's calling my old self out\nright now. So I just wanted to\noffer that. I see examples of\nthat in me still to this day. So\ngetting really clear in those\nmoments when I'm just gonna say,\nOh, I'm stressed. No, am I\nsomething else that can help me\nfind a new plan forward?\nYes, it and it's so hard. It's\nso powerful. It's so powerful.\nAnd we do this in different\nways. And different people's\numbrella label is often again,\ngoing to depend on the display\nrules of their experience of\ntheir childhood, of the context\nof everything that's going on\naround them. So that's really\nreally important. Another aspect\nof being able to step out is\nthat that if we think about the\nway we often talk about our\nexperiences will say I am sad, I\nam angry, okay. I am\ntraumatized. I am being\nundermined, you know, and I can\ngive like 1000 examples because,\nas I mentioned earlier, these\nthoughts, these emotion, these\nexperiences, I mean if i if i I\nhad to say to you, you know,\nthink about why your big toe on\nyour one foot is better than\nyour big toe and your other\nfoot, you know, we will all be\nable to come up with a reason\nbecause our minds are constantly\nin the mode of criticizing\njudging, assessing, that's our\nmind doing the job that it was\nmeant to do. So what starts to\nhappen is one of the ways we can\nget stuck, we can get\nemotionally rigid is where we\nstart saying something like, I\nam set, I am angry, I am being\nundermined. It's so subtle. But\na lot of my work is really about\nthe way we language, about our\nexperience, and how the way we\nlanguage about our experience\nactually, either endorses that\nexperience in a way that keeps\nus stuck, or endorses our\nexperience in a way that allows\nus to breathe into a new way of\nbeing. And so I am sad, what are\nyou saying, when you say I am\nsad? You're saying I am. All of\nme, 100% of me, there is no\nspace, there's no space for\ncompassion, there's no space for\nwisdom, there's no space for\nbreathing or mindfulness or\nthere's no space for me to reach\nout my hand to my two or three\nyear old who's waiting for my\nbecause I'm so stuck in that I\nam. You know, if you think about\nwhat you're doing linguistically\nis you're defining yourself, all\nof you, 100% of you, by that\nexperience. And the example that\nI give them the metaphor, it's a\nlittle bit like, if you go\noutside, and there's a cloud in\nthe sky, I am sad, as you have\nnow identified with that cloud,\nyou know, you are the cloud. So\nlinguistically, what we can\nstart to do is we can start\nnoticing our thoughts, our\nemotions, and our stories for\nwhat they are. They are\nthoughts, they are emotions,\nthey are stories, then they are\nvalid experiences, but they are\nnot definitional experiences. In\nother words are not all\nencompassing experiences. This\nis really, really important. So\ninstead of saying I'm sad, I'm\nnoticing that I'm feeling sad.\nI'm noticing that this is my I'm\nnot good enough story. What you\nstart doing here is you're not\nbottling, you're not pushing\naside, you're not avoiding, but\nrather, you are saying, I am not\ngoing to be defined in my\nentirety by this experience. And\nso this is this is so powerful\nwhen you start naming your\nthoughts, your emotions and your\nstories for what they are our\nthoughts, emotions and stories,\nyou start creating space. So I'm\nnoticing that I'm feeling sad,\nI'm noticing that this is my I'm\nnot good enough story, what you\nstart doing is you start\nactually creating linguistic and\npsychological space. Again, so\nyou can step out of the jar. And\nto further that metaphor, that I\ndescribed earlier, as a human\nbeing, you are not your emotion,\nyou are not the cloud, you are\nthe sky, you know, you are the\nsky, you are capacious and\nbeautiful and messy enough to\nhave all of your clouds and to\nstill move forward in the world\nwith intention.\nSuch a such a beautiful picture.\nAnd you know, really honoring\nthe fullness, you know of our\nexperience and also honoring the\nthe past experiences that have\nshaped the way of being that\nmany of us wake up to see right,\nall of that patterning, all of\nthat, you know, distancing or\nbrooding whatever it might be\nfor us came from someplace. So\nagain, this doesn't mean that\nwe, you know, are in denial of\nthat which happened. It's part\nof our story, though, it allows\nus to, to expand and, you know,\nI love how you're highlighting\nthe power of linguistics. And I\nbelieve that often, the practice\ndoes begin inside our internal\nworld, becoming that observer\nseeing the language that are\ncoloring our thoughts, and\ncreating change there before, as\nmany of us want to actually\nchange in real time when now my\npartner says that thing and I\nwant to expand that space and\ncreate a new response in that\nmoment that comes once we've\npractice, practice, practice\nonce we are able to create space\nfor ourselves, because that's\nwhat complicates, at least in my\nopinion, our experience of being\nhumans. We have other people\nhuman being around us becoming\nreactive, right? Touching are\nactivating our deepest wounds\nall in real time. And now here\nyou hear someone like yourself\nand me sitting here speaking Oh,\nwell, we need space and to be\nexpanded in that moment, that\nall sounds like theory, that\nonly becomes possible once we're\npracticing once we're really\naware of how powerful Our\nthoughts are creating space for\nourselves so that the next time\nwe now interact with another\nvery complicated, messy human,\nright, we can both create the\nspace to honor all the rest of\nthe self, that might not be an\nexpression because we're\nactivated or because something\nfrom our past is trying to take\nover. Though, over time, we can\nexpand that space into our day\nto day moments, and really begin\nto create some change.\nIt's, it's so powerful, because\nI think it's it's really, you\nknow, what you spoke about, just\nat the beginning of that\nobservation is that you're not,\nyou're not turning your back on\nyour past. In fact, when you\nnotice your thoughts and\nfeelings and experiences for\nwhat they are, you are seeing\nmore of yourself. And the reason\nthat I say that is because you\nare turning yourself towards\nother parts of yourself, you\nknow, other parts of yourself\nthat are maybe in the shadows or\nhidden, or have been\novershadowed by this difficult\nexperience. And so that is like,\nsuch, you know, such a\nprofoundly powerful way of being\nand, and, you know, this idea of\nI am noticing, we can start\npracticing. But we can also\nstart recognizing that often\npeople will say, oh, but you\nknow, when I, when I get caught\noff guard by an emotion, it's\nlike the emotion just came out\nof the blue. You know, like, I\ndon't know how to do that in the\nmoment. But what I would really\nencourage is the recognition\nthat most of the times when we\nare caught off guard, there's no\nof God anything, you know, most\nof it is so patterned, so\npredictable. So autopilot, that,\nthat developing this, this\nrecognition, and even this\nacknowledgement of like, you\nknow, what is it in this\nconversation with my partner\nabout finances, or with my\nspouse about finances, that\nalways leads me into the space?\nWell, I've got this difficulty\nmotion and I'm noticing this\ndifficulty motion. And I can\neven notice that in the midst of\na conversation, I consider\nmyself, I'm noticing the urge to\nshut down. You can notice that\nin the moment and it's so\npowerful. But in extending the\npractice of emotional agility.\nWhat you're also saying is what\nare my difficult emotions, your\nsignposting? You know my\ndifficult emotion, my emotions,\nsignpost, my values, my\nemotions, signpost, my values.\nSo to go back to that example.\nI'm feeling shut down in this\nconversation. Yeah, about about\nfinances as an example. But it\ncould be anything else. And I'm\nfeeling activated. And I'm\nnoticing that this is my urge to\nshut down. There is then such\npower in saying what is this\ndifficulty motion signposting\nabout what is important to me.\nAnd it might be that that\ndifficult emotion is signposting\nthat this conversation is coming\nup against your value of\nautonomy. You know that that\nsomehow in the conversation, you\nfeel like you are having your\nautonomy threatened, or that\nthis is a value around fairness\nthat has been threatened. So\nthis is really important,\nbecause this is then how we step\ninto the power of the\nconversation, which is not about\njust Okay, now I'm going to shut\ndown and be quiet. And I'm going\nto try to have the conversation\nagain. It allows me to say to\nthe person to be in context, and\nto say, you know, autonomy is\nreally important to me. And I\nrecognize that when we have this\nconversation, when we have this\ninteraction, that's what I'm\nrunning up against. Or this\nfeels unfair, and this is\nimportant. So this is again,\nwhere you're not being held or\nmaneuvered or manipulated by a\npast experience, but rather you\nare stepping into your values\nand stepping into the present.\nYes, yes. And I think you know,\nultimately, your work, my work\nthe work that, you know, we're\nshowing up to do and is to\nempower is to empower, right?\nThat that stepping into that\nacknowledgement that that\nawareness that we are, you know,\nfull creatures that as the\nresult of many different\nexperiences are living in very\nconditioned ways, again, just\nusing the language for the\ncommunity here, right? And that\nultimately, it's safer, their\nchange is very difficult to\nactualize change to grow into\nour fullness. There are reasons\nthere are patterns, there is a\nstory that one could say we are\ntelling day in and day out. And\nthese very oftentimes reactive\nways, yeah, and disempowered\nways and powerless ways that\nwere showing up and I was having\na giggle in terms of this core\nvalue. Because things aren't\ncoincidental. I as much as I\ncould say, Oh, I don't know why\nI'm upset in this moment, what\nI've now learned of doing my own\ninvestigation, exploration\nwitnessing is for me, all roads\nlead back to whether upset over\ndishes not being done, or me not\nbeing heard in a conversation,\nall roads lead back to my value\naround having my voice and my\nexperience honored coming from a\nvery deeply wounded place where\nI didn't feel that I didn't feel\nfully attuned to in my family\nunit. So again, whether it's\ndishes left out, I'm upset. Why?\nBecause in that moment, I don't\nfeel like my voice was\nconsidered just as much as I'm\nupset. In a conversation with my\npartner for somewhat of the same\nreason I could be, you know,\nsurprised by the upset in both\nof those areas. Or I could do\nthe practical work, I could dive\nin, I can explore what is going\non in each of these moments what\nvalue to use, your language is\nbeing challenged. And for me,\nI've uncovered one of my deepest\nvalues, because it wasn't met in\nmy childhood is being seen, yes,\nhaving my voice and my emotions\nconsidered. So I will fight\ntooth and nail to make sure that\nhappens. And when it doesn't, I\nbecome very reactive. Of course,\nbecoming reactive is not the way\nto get one's voice. Right. So we\npeel back the onion. And from\nthat wounded space, I can\nunderstand I understand my\nvalue, I've been able to have\ndifficult conversations and been\nable to now actualize that value\nin real time, how can I have\nmyself heard, so that I don't\nbecome reactive. And I just like\nto share that example. Because\nwhen we dive down, a lot of us\nare having this one value, or\nthis one wound that is showing\nup all over the place as points\nof reactivity. But it's coming\nfrom that same space.\nIt's so you it's you make such a\npowerful observation. And, and\nit's something that I've spoken\nto in other parts of my work,\nwhich is, what's really\ninteresting is the very act of\nbeing owned by your forte,\nemotional story, even if the\nthought emotional story relates\nto evaluate. So in your\ninstance, in your experience,\nyour voice.\nWhen we owned, we actually get\nin our own way of that value. So\nit's, it's like such a kind of\nparadox, which is in the state\nof being reactive, you almost\nshut out any capacity for the\nperson to genuinely hear your\nvoice. And I, you know, you\nshared one of your core values,\nI'll share that my one of my\ncore values is autonomy. And the\nsame kind of situation, as you\nknow, anyone who watches my TED\ntalk will know, and I don't\ncompletely share all the details\nin that Ted Talk. Because it was\na 16 minute talk. But there's a\nvery difficult experience of the\nimpact of losing a parent at a\nyoung age, growing up in a very\nparticular community. And then\nthe after effects of what felt\nto me like a complete loss of\nautonomy. And so almost every\naspect of when I run into\ndifficulty is autonomy. And\nwhat's funny is that is that\nwhat that can lead to me, you\nknow, if I feel like my autonomy\nis being threatened, is I become\nresistant, I dig my heels in I,\nyou know, do all of those\nthings. But what's really\nfascinating is, I am not not\nacting with my own autonomy, you\nknow, it's rather the story,\nagain, that is owning me and is\ntaking my autonomy. So it's just\nit's just a really interesting\nobservation. I think. I think\nit's very powerful for people to\nbe kind of connecting in with,\nagain, this idea of, I can show\nup to my difficult emotions and\nstories. But they are data, not\ndirectives. What I'm trying to\ndo here is I'm trying to not act\ninto My emotions or react into\nmy emotions, but rather to step\ninto and respond into my values.\nAnd I think that's that, you\nknow, when you talk about\naction. That's the action. That\nis that is the work of moving forward.\nYes, yes, I think this is a\nbeautiful place, I'm going to\nhighlight this last sentence\nright action into lean into live\ninto our values. Right? I'm of\nthe belief that they've existed\nsince we came here, right?\nThere's this inner space, this\ninner knowing this full self\nthat as you know, our full\nconversation has been unpacking\nall of the ways that we aren't\nshowing up in full connection,\nintegration and service of\nthough it's there, and learning\nhow to lean into those values\nthat way of being embrace,\nright, the fullness that is us,\nthat is what your work is about.\nI love Like I said, how you you\nshare so much of yourself your\nstory, and the practical the\nOkay, how do we translate this?\nHow can I see these concepts in\naction? I know that our\nlisteners have probably gained\nso much value from what you've\nshared here today. It's been\ntruly an honor. Like I said, Dr.\nSusan, David, I've been watching\nyour work. I've been inspired by\nyour work. Since I've since I\nmet it. I forget how long ago\nthat was. So I'm truly honored\nto have spent the time with you\ntoday. Before we end, if you can\nlet us know anyone listening\nfrom the YouTube channel, who\nwhere to find you where to find\nyour book, emotional agility?\nWhere to keep connected with\nyou. Yes, so\nI wanted to just say the feeling\nis mutual. Thank you for the I\nthink the language and the\ncapacity that you are enabling,\nand that is being enabled at a\ncollector. I think it's just so\npowerful. For anyone who wants\nto connect with me, I'm on all\nthe different social media\nchannels, Susan David, my\nwebsite is Susan debbie.com. And\nI've got a free quiz there that\nabout 150,000 people have taken\nnow which is really asking just\na couple of questions about\nemotional agility. And from that\nyou get a free 10 page report. A\nlot of people find that really\nhelpful. My TED Talk, which is\non the gift and power of\nemotional courage, and then my\nbook emotional agility. Awesome,\nthank you. We'll make sure all\nthat is linked up so that you\nguys can find your way to Dr.\nSusan David. I definitely\nsuggest all of her work and all\nof the forum's her book is\namazing. Definitely go over\nfollow her work and stay\nconnected. And thank you again,\nSusan, for your time here today.\nThank you"
