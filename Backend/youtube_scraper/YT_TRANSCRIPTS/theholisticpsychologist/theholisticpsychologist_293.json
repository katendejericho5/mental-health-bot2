    "transcript": "incredible so thank you michael\nessentially i'm hearing michael ask if\nwe could sum up the work\nin a word or in a phrase what would that\nbe\nso first gotta admit two words\nthat came and that popped into my mind\nwhen i heard this question\nare probably words that for those of you\nwho have been following me\nhave probably heard me speak\nconsistently ad nauseam\nso my two words are conscious\nempowerment\nfor me i really believe that embodies\nwhat we're doing\nhere what the work is all about it's\nabout really tuning in\nto the choice mainly that comes with a\npractice\nof conscious empowerment really\nacknowledging that so many of us\nfeel disempowered we feel stuck because\nwe don't feel like we have choice\nwe feel like we're living reactively as\nmany of us are\nliving again from that autopilot so when\ni consider\nthe work you'll hear me often talk about\nhow it is an\naction it's a process of sorts and what\nthe process is\nagain for me it's an empowering a\nconsciousness\nso that i can show up as a conscious\nbeing in each and every moment\nas they definitely shift and change as\nwe grow as we age as our relationships\nchange as our world\nchanges around us however we can still\nempower ourselves\nto make choices choices that are more\naligned\nwith who we are now and again who we\ncontinue to evolve and change\nto be so for me the process of or the\nwork\nthe two words that come to mind for me\nare conscious empowerment\nwhat was it that came to mind when you\nwhen you heard this question from from\nmichael\nuh immediately the single word that came\nto mind for me\nwas and is consistency and i love\nhow we both naturally just went down two\ndifferent\npaths with this you're getting great at\nlooking sharing the\nthe stage too nicole's always used to\nbeing just dead on one person so this is\na practice it's great\num consistency for me is kind of like\nthe big macro house of\neverything so the conscious empowerment\nthat you're talking about\neverything all of the tools in the book\num to me literally live in this house\ncalled\nconsistency and all of these tools are\ninside of it and\nwithout that consistency nothing really\nchanges or\ntransforms so this conscious empowerment\nthe tools that the book gives you the\ndoors that it opens to allow you to\nchoose\nto make conscious choice to empower\nyourself to heal\nto go on this journey if you're not\nconsistent with that\nyou won't necessarily see any results if\nyou go to the gym once that's great for\nthat day\nand then you're not going to see any\nimprovement over time\nso i think what your conscious\nempowerment is kind of like the\nblueprint\nfoundation and then that conscious\nempowerment in choice\nthat married into this house of\nconsistency and really continuing on\nthis journey over and over\non a daily basis for me really\nencapsulates\nthe whole book so how to do the work\nconsistently\nyeah yeah absolutely and piggybacking\noff all of these three concepts now\nconscious empowerment and consistency um\nfor me i saw i\nlike overwhelmingly i believe that's\nwhat was lacking um in the old model and\nthe way that i had been working\num and seeing clients week after week\nyou know\nwhat i was noticing was incredible\ninsight coming from our conscious mind\nwhen the human was sitting in front of\nme when we have\naccess right to the things that did not\nwork for us in the past many of us able\nto empower ourselves\nwith the plan at least to make new\nchoices in the future\nyet what i consistently came up against\nin my own life and i heard from\nclients again week after week month\nafter month year after year\nis how unable to build that bridge how\nunable\nwe pretty generally and universally as\nhumans have increasing insight\nyet can't create change so for me that's\nwhy i'm highlighting right the idea of\nconsciousness we need how to learn\nto create a habit of living consciously\nall of the time and then piggybacking on\nthat\nconsistently outside of session because\nwhat i get\nsimilarly like the gym example like the\ntherapy example that's one hour\nout of many hours that were existing in\nany given week\nand what we're all i think becoming\nincreasingly aware of\nand actually a question that we're going\nto we're going to present in a few\nminutes\nfrom someone else who called in talked a\nlittle bit about why\ngenerally it is difficult to change for\nus humans we don't like\nto go into that unfamiliar territory so\nthe pull\nto stay in those ruts is incredibly\nstrong for all of us\nso when jenna's offering the consistent\nnow application of new tools new\nthoughts new behaviors\nit has to begin to lay down new habits\njust as consistently\nas those old habits were practiced for\nso many of us so\nwhen we think of now those three words\ntogether right conscious empowerment\nthrough consistency\nmaybe that is our full you know kind of\nco-lab co-created\ndefinition and when we are conscious\nagain we get we\ngift ourselves with choice um we can\nlearn how to live in alignment for some\nof us with\nour you know our passions our purpose\nthe deeper\nthings within us that we might not be\nliving in alignment toward and we don't\ndo that again when we're operating\nfrom that autopilot because we all know\nwhat's there for many of us it's those\nhabits and patterns that haven't\nbeen serving us so i think too we\nwe all know a lot as humans you know a\nlot i know a lot we\nas a world know or at least as a nation\nknow you know if we\neat less and work out more we'll lose\nweight yet the majority of the\npopulation\nis still overweight which shows us that\nknowing truly makes no\ndifference it's putting the knowing into\naction so\ni think michael if we were to stretch\nthis from a word or a phrase and just\nmake a complete sentence\nreally how to do the work is conscious\nempowerment through consistent action\nyes yes beautiful so conscious\nempowerment\nthrough consistent action again each and\nevery day we put up the tools on social\nmedia so those of you who are following\nalong\nhave probably heard this language before\nand then of course contained in the\npages of this\nof this book are the the action plans\nwhat are\nyou know the steps each and every\nchapter we talk conceptually\nyou know what what is the ego what is\nthe inner child how do these things show\nup in our daily life\nand at the end of each and every chapter\nthere is that practical application\nthere is the how\nto there is how to make this now into a\nhabit into our lives\nso for those of you who have the book\nmight be working your way through those\nexercises but to speak to jenna's point\nit is in action right changing building\nthe bridge from insight\ninto that conscious empowered consistent\naction\nor actually change first begins the seed\nof change becomes planted\nand it blossoms literally into\ntransformation\ni love it i just got really excited\nabout the book if you're new to\neverything that's being said\nyou're in a perfect place to both learn\nit and then when you get to those pages\nyou know at the end of a chapter when\nyou think oh this is amazing i've\nlearned something\nnow what do i do you turn the next page\nand it really is\na very practical application of well\nhere's what you just learned now here's\na way to apply it to your life and\nbefore we dive into the next question\nwhat you're going to do in one second\num just a note on how to live with the\nexercises\nright embed them in your life begin to\npractice them consistently i often get\nasked is there a\ngolden number of how many days right i\nhave to do this thing\nthere's no end point right until this\nbecomes an integrated habit until for\ninstance i learn how to live\nmy moments consciously more often than\nnot\nthat is when we end right so it's not\nreally an end point\nthere's no 30 days 60 days check the box\nand i'm done\nit's how long does it take me to\nintegrate this into my now\ndaily habit of being so for some of us\nthat means sitting with these exercises\ni know for me as someone who discovered\nin my own journey of self-healing\nhow unconscious i was living how strong\nmy autopilot was\ni created a habit of consciousness for\nwell beyond 30 days so for those of you\nwho have\nbeen going through the book that\nbuilding consciousness those journal\nprompts\nright in the beginning around becoming\nconscious to ourselves\nwe are not our thoughts everything\nembodied in that chapter didn't end for\nme after 30 days\nit's a lifelong habit that i'm still\npracticing so just a note on how to use\nthe exercises\nthese are lifelong exercises which is\nwhy we often suggest\nstarting with one area and really\nbecoming good and\nconsistent in that one area before we\neven build\nanother habit and again we're going to\ndive a little deeper\ninto change and all of that that comes\nup along with change but i just wanted\nto make that note before we dive into\nquestion number\ntwo\nmonica monica thank you michael for your\nquestion\nthank you everyone who called in with\nyour questions yes thank you everyone i\nthank you for saying that jenna we had\nso\nsuch an overwhelming response so many so\nmany questions\num as we often do we try to be\nintentional\npicking questions that we think will\nresonate with the most of you out there\nlistening though there was so\nso many questions there were even too\nmany to to count so thank you everyone\nwho had asked your questions and know\nthat there'll be many more opportunities\nto call in to ask questions it's\ndefinitely going to be a part of our\npodcast coming up\nso let me know whenever we're ready and\nwe'll hear from monica\nall right\nall right thank you monica um thank you\nif you're listening if you tune into\nthis later\num really great question we got\ndifferent versions\nof this question around loneliness\nfeeling alone\nrelational questions not feeling\nconnected to others um so we thought\nthis was a\ngreat kind of representation of\nsomething that's coming up for a lot of\nyou\nwhich is again not really feeling\nfulfilled possibly in our relationships\nmaybe having that deep feeling of\nloneliness\num so first i want to we want to answer\nthis i think in two ways\nand the first part of this answer\nis honoring the reality that many of us\nfeel alone\nbecause we don't actually feel connected\nto the first relationship our primary\nrelationship in our world in our lives\nwhich is\nthe relationship we have with ourselves\nmany of us have never\nyou know taken time to connect with our\npossibly\nour physical beings maybe for some of us\nemotionally\nwe don't allow our emotions presence and\nour lives\nand then there's obviously that deeper\nthat more essence spiritual based sense\nof self\nso many of us have a habit of not tuning\nin to ourselves so what happens over\ntime\nis we become more and more distance from\nourselves\nmore and more disconnected to the extent\nthat it can begin to present itself as\nfeeling deeply lonely because we are\nliterally alone in a sense we aren't\neven\nstaying in alignment or in connection\nwith the self\nfirst and i wanted to just pause on this\npart of the\nthe answer because i think logically a\nlot of us anticipate the answer to be\nsomething outside\nright finding the right person finding\nthe the person who to use monica's\nlanguage\ncan be supportive of ourselves or can\nhelp us\nmeet our needs now of course we are\ninterpersonal creatures we need\nrelationships as humans however the most\nprimary\nrelationship begins with ourselves and\nmany of us\nkind of overstep that relationship and\ntry to fill our cup as we say\nfrom the outside in or using external\nthings even such as relationships in\nother\npeople without really taking the time\nto connect with ourself first\nso reconnecting with ourself what does\nthat mean that means honoring the fact\nthat we do have\nneeds we're all living this this human\nexistence in a physical body\nthat has differing varying needs\ndepending on who we are as individuals\nwe have different emotional needs\nenergetic needs the things that make us\nfeel\nare quite different than the things that\nmake other people feel\nnow again i believe that we all have a\nuniqueness or an essence inside that is\nus\nthat desires to express and what a lot\nof us have done again is we've been\nbecome\ndisconnected from either of those areas\nof ourselves\nwe either hear our needs and\ncontinuously suppress or deny them\nor if you're like me you've lived life\non a spaceship for so long\nyou have no idea what your needs even\nare\nso honoring that for many of us this\nbecomes a process of cultivating that\nauthentic connection with the self\nfirst in the book we devote a whole\nchapter on the topic of re-parenting\nwhich essentially is the process of\ndoing just that\nof acknowledging that we all have needs\nin all of those areas\nphysical emotional and spiritual and\nagain it gives us the tools to begin\nthe journey to honor those needs over\ntime\nso again the first step of how do i\nbecome less lonely how do i become more\nconnected with others\nis we become more connected with ourself\nfirst\ni think what's important to note here\ntoo is that relationship to\nself wealth some of you may not even\nrealize that you don't necessarily have\na connection or relationship to self we\nkind of\na lot of us do go through life on this\nautopilot just living being you know i'm\nsmiling jenna and this is\ni have some identity over here not\nreally looking at like the internal\nmirror of really well who\nam i if i take away all of everyone\nelse's identity and opinions and\nprojections and ideas of\nme and my personality or whoever i am\nwho am i actually to me\nand that can be for the first time very\nconfronting or very uncomfortable if\nyou've never truly sat to meet yourself\nor you've only known yourself\nthrough the reflection of eyes of others\nor the the thought or opinion\nof others so i know for me too this was\njust on my own journey it was important\nto constantly remind myself that\nthe discomfort of meeting myself was\nwas a a messenger in a way and a very\nimportant door\nopening and an access for me for much\nmuch\ndeeper healing it's easy for when\nsomething's new\ni use the word discomfort a lot but also\nreally discomfort to me\ntends to translate into oh it's just new\nwhen something's new\nit feels very uncomfortable and my\nimmediate\nreaction is to just go and run away from\nit not\nrealizing at first if i'm if i'm not\nhaving conscious empowered choice or i'm\nnot sitting in conscious choice which\nagain\nis a practice i may run away from it and\nif i'm able to sit with myself\nfirst sit in that discomfort maybe even\ni'm just scheduled an afternoon alone by\nmyself and i'm twiddling my thumbs i\ndon't know what to do\ni feel anxious i feel uncomfortable i\nwant to go do something else\nbut really sitting with and exploring\nmyself spending time with myself in the\nsame way\ni would spend time with another person\nor if i was watching a little child how\ni would engage with them\nlike nicole mentioned in the reparenting\nchapter in the book we talk about that\nwhere it's\nquite literally re-parenting little you\nso a good way maybe to look at this if\nyou do struggle with or find discomfort\nin being alone or meeting yourself is to\nimagine like if i'm hanging out with me\ni'm going to imagine little jenna right\nnext to me\nand just kind of explore what do i like\ndoing what's fun do i want to be in\nnature i'm usually always called to\nnature in trees do i want to do art\nlisten to music\nwhatever it is allowing myself even if\nit feels uncomfortable to just sit in\nthat space\nand those moments with myself maybe\njournal maybe ask myself some questions\nand just\nexplore and to really note that anytime\ni'm feeling that physical\npain or hearing that little voice it's\nlike you know go distract go online go\nscroll\ngo do something else to kind of have a\nlittle light go off that oh\nmaybe that's that thing maybe that's\nthat discomfort\nwhere i really do need to practice being\nalone and really\nincrease my tolerance for that\ndiscomfort and\ni want to just illuminate again here\nit's really important to remember that\nthis is a practice\nif you're new to spending time with\nyourself or really\nafraid even to spend time with yourself\nplease remember that it is a practice\nthat when done\nconsistently will lead you to the\nhealing that you're embarking on\nyeah thank you for that reminder jenna\nbecause i think for a lot of us\nthat do feel deeply alone for some of us\nalone is the most uncomfortable\nplace to be um i know for me the idea of\nstopping and being silent or\nor you know having a couple hours or it\nwas just me\nat the beginning of my journey i felt\nlike i wanted to crawl out of my skin\nbecause when i didn't have the external\nthing to put my attention on for me\nthe endless to-do list or even the other\nhuman what do you want to do jennifer\nhow can i service you\nthat all the time right and i have to to\nlook at me\nfor me that was so uncomfortable because\ni felt it in my body\nit feels different for each of us but\nfor me it was almost like a visceral\nagitation i\nquite literally felt to be crawling out\nof my skin and usually that agitation\nwas matched with\nracing thoughts for me again all the\nother things i should or could be doing\nor worrying about\nwhat's happening because i'm not doing\nwhatever x y or z is still happening in\nthe world\nwhile i'm alone so thank you for kind of\nhighlighting\nthat as we begin these new practices for\nmany of us every parenting of\ncultivating an authentic aligned\nrelationship with ourself\nwhere we acknowledge and honor our needs\nfor so many of us\nthat will be uncomfortable one of my\ncore narratives so for those of you who\nare reading along\nhave probably met this narrative or\nheard me share it in the book\nwhich is my chorus of narratives is\naround this idea of being considered\nright so eve this this topic excel\nitself of re-parenting right to consider\none's needs might as well have right\nticked me off into that uncomfortable\neven looking right in the mirror and\nacknowledging that this\nbeing has needs this being that is me\nwas my first kind of movement into that\nunfamiliar space\nso up came all the resistances all of\nthe reasons why i should not be\nconsidering my own needs in this moment\nand similarly felt incredibly\nuncomfortable\ndoing so so thank you for that reminder\nany one of us\nwho are doing any work in the\nre-parenting area\nto better and off and more authentically\nhonor our needs\nprobably can anticipate some degree\nright of this discomfort however the\nreason why we're doing\nthis work of reconnecting with the self\nonce we build that foundation the second\npart\nof this answer is to begin to\nauthentically connect\nwith community right to be able to now\nshow up as my full\nself as a being who does have needs and\nwho's able to acknowledge and express\nthose needs\nauthentically and safely for those\naround me\nallows me the ability to authentically\nnow connect with other people\nright so back to monica's question which\non the surface\nfelt like this was going to be the\nanswer how do i authentically connect\nwith others\nas a reminder we have to first be in\nalignment and authentic within ourselves\nbefore then i can again engage in a new\nprocess\nof authentically connecting with others\nit doesn't for many of us come naturally\nso far more of us are used to wearing\nmasks assuming\nroles playing the helper the caretaker\nthe million ways that we show up in\nrelationships\nwhich might not be fully in service of\nour needs\nso the final chapter in the book very\nintentionally\nonce we do the work of healing what\nwe're doing is building the foundation\nso that we can\nstand and embrace our authenticity\nso that we may then connect with the\ncommunity\naround us the final chapter entitled\ninterdependence\nis just that how do i now show up in my\nauthenticity\nfor others to see to support others to\nengage\nin more truer relationships with others\nwhich is what i believe\nall of us are intending to do um it just\nso happens that in that chapter for\nthose of you read along you will meet\nme um the character of jenna and how our\npast first began to cross\nof course but the reason why she was\nincluded in that chapter\nwas from similar to monica a very deep\nsense of loneliness\nthat i was feeling myself based on yes a\nlack of connection with the self\ni had done the work of healing i'd been\nre-parenting i did feel like i was\nbeginning to express myself\nauthentically\nand i wanted other people i was starting\nto actually feel lonely for authentic\nrelationships and that's of course where\njenna and i crossed\npaths she was doing her own work of\nself-healing and expressing herself as a\nwhole individual and now of course we\nhave the\nopportunity because it still does take\nwork for us both to begin to cultivate\nnow together\na more authentic relationship\nthat chapter gives me chills the whole\nstory does really i love this question\nmonica and i think\num i think a lot of us really can\nresonate with this because it's you know\nwhere do i begin how do i meet my own\nneeds how do i have other people meet my\nneeds\nand really it it is such a natural flow\nand that relationship with self first\ntruly\nis the bridge to then being able to\nconnect with others having that\ncommunity\nhaving that support i can't expect\nnicole or ask nicole to meet my needs if\ni don't yet know what my needs are\nso really sitting with myself first\nunderstanding me more and\ni think as you really do begin to spend\ntime\nwith you when you stop it looking\nexternally and really start to explore\nand look internally to who you are\ndoing the work using the tools in the\nbook finding your own true\nauthentic self and self expression that\nnaturally will open itself up also just\nenergetically to the people\naround you i know that's very much how\nnicole came into my\norbit and everyone really who's come on\nto my path over the last couple of years\nlike nicole said i'd been\non my own self-healing journey much\nbefore\ni even you know was shown nicole's\ninstagram and\ni am very grateful for always having\nbeen surrounded by\na community of people that saw me as the\nperson that i was stepping into\nversus the person that's showing up\nright now or who i was before\nand those people didn't just come out of\nnowhere for me i very intentionally\nput people in groups and organizations\non my path where\ni was very intentionally challenging\nmyself and sort of breaking myself\nopen learning my belief systems learning\nmy condition pattern\npatterns i'm looking at like all of my\nwounds and traumas and really\nfacing all of the things that i didn't\nwant want to face or didn't feel like i\nwanted to which really goes back to that\ndiscomfort all of those moments when i\nwas like i don't want to look at that\ni've run far away from everything up\nuntil 17 year old jenna\nand beyond and it was really when i\nstopped and turned around\nand said you know i'm actually going to\nstop building i'd say this all the time\ni felt like i was building a life on a\nfoundation of sand\nand i finally stopped doing that turned\naround and looked at all of the things\nthat i didn't want to that made me\nuncomfortable\ni really explored me and i set myself up\nthrough doing that i was able to express\nwho i was authentically what my needs\nwere what does matter to me\nand when you do that the universe really\ndoes align you with people who are on it\na similar vibration a similar energy\nwho are on the same path so naturally as\nthat happens when you put one foot in\nfront of the other\nyou will start to notice people popping\nup even in this community if you're on\ninstagram right now or on youtube\nyou've got thousands of people online\nwith you now in the community in\ncomments who\nare on the journey with you i know we\nhave our self-healer circle membership\nwhere we're\nconsciously creating and intentionally\ncreating a space for us\nto continue growing and creating that\ncommunity because we do understand like\nwhen we started our journeys it's kind\nof like well\nwhere is everyone which is the point of\ndoing the work\nnow the more that you are able to show\nup and then the more you're able to\nto kind of take that leap it is\nuncomfortable to express yourself\nvulnerably it does feel like you're\nstanding naked in front of a crowd\nsometimes\nand when you're able to do that in a\nsafe space which is the\ncommunity and the self-healers movement\nthat we're creating and that nicole has\nso beautifully ignited in everyone\nyou'll start to see that you've got\nother people right alongside you who are\nwho are on the same path but you're what\nyou're highlighting here too jenna is\ngoing back in a sense\nto question one and how we answer that\nright\neven this the act of connecting with\nanother human\nis an action um you said something\nreally really you know astute in in the\nmiddle of that\nwhich was to to get a need met we have\nto\noffer someone the reality that we have a\nneed right we have to say\nsomething we have to ask for support we\nhave to tell someone\nwhat's going on for us people aren't\nmind readers\nand again for many of us we do carry\nthat belief into adulthood\nthat people should just know i've heard\na million different\niterations of this if they loved me\nenough they would know\nif i was important enough they would\nknow this idea that people again\nshould just know for many of us that's a\nremnant of a time\nwhere are the adults around us the\ncaregivers did appear all-knowing\nright we had a need we could barely\ncommunicate with them and it did feel to\nsome extent that they\njust knew of course on a degree of\nattunement we all had different\ncaregivers\nthough as we evolve into adulthood\npeople don't\njust know people are living lives from\ntheir own vantage point their own point\nof view\nand reacting to themselves in a way so\nit is very difficult\nfor someone to know if they're if it's\nnot spoken\nso any of us that have that that belief\nthat others should know for whatever\nreason if the love was enough\nif the care was enough if i was the\nright person for them\nunfortunately that's just not true um so\nit is an\naction right of showing up differently\nnow in relationship\nto possibly ask for support and this is\nwhere i continue to struggle\nbeing the human who at her core didn't\nfeel considered\nright showing up in daily service of\nconsidering myself is part of my journey\nthe other half of my journey now is to\nallow the relationships around me to be\nsupportive to me\nfor me to experience the benefit of\nhaving\nauthentic and aligned individuals yet\nit is increasingly difficult for me to\nstill do that to say\nhey jenna i have a need hey can you\nsupport me team or whoever you are\nto speak right that from that vulnerable\nplace to speak the need in action\nis quite difficult so asking for help\nasking for support if you are someone\nlike monica feeling alone\nknow that the second half of your\njourney means being vulnerable\nasking for help and then the second part\nreceiving\nletting someone help you letting someone\nright take the stress for you\nletting someone receive your emotion or\nhold\nspace letting yourself receive the help\nand you can try on to for me it's saying\nlike\nwhile it is difficult also just\nswitching the language of yes this is\ndifficult but why is this difficult for\nme\nand chances are i think for many of us\ndifficult is usually\nnew it's difficult because we haven't\nmastered it yet we don't know it yet we\nhaven't practiced yet\nso even voicing i mean even just\non a daily basis in our communication i\ncan't expect\nsupport from nicole in a way if\ni'm not expressing it she's learning my\nneeds i'm learning her needs so\nthere is a flow that happens in\nrelationship to people\nbut there definitely are times where i\nthink like you know why doesn't this\nperson just know what i need\nwhy can't they read my mind and i\nrealize oh they don't know me\nthey don't know my story they only know\nthe jenna that presents myself as i\nspeak to them so it's also that action\nstep that you're\nspeaking of is it's crucial here and\nthat\ndifficulty of speaking up i maybe would\ntry on saying like this is\nit's new to speak up it's uncomfortable\nfor me to speak up\nand then also noting oh it's\nuncomfortable again well now i'm back to\nthat uncomfortable feeling\nokay let's look into this because\nchances are this is an opportunity to\ncatapult me\nso it's uncomfortable because it's new\nif it's new\nin the direction i'm going then maybe i\nshould try it on try speaking up because\nit\nit really does take something inside of\nyou to ask for help or to ask for to\nsupport or to ask for your needs or even\njust sharing on social media\nyou can i know for me just i used\ninstagram for the past few years\nas a diary or a journal and i would just\nshare my journey along the way\nand that's how i expressed outward to\npeople because if i didn't\nthere wasn't anyone else that i was\nspeaking to so really\nthinking okay this is difficult or hard\nall right well it's just new it's\nuncomfortable\nso now i'm going to take an actual\nphysical action i'm going to write\nsomeone i'm going to talk to someone or\ni'm going to share something\nyeah really really beautiful teaching to\nmake right here which is that our\nlanguage matters\neven the language that we're repeating\nin our minds matter\nyou know catching yourself when you when\nyou do say maybe labeling at discomfort\nor when we label it i can't or\nnotice the words that you're saying to\nyourself obviously noticing the words\nthat you say outwardly\nthough for a lot of us it's what is the\ndialogue are we negating this process\nfor ourself and our minds or\nare we using language that might not be\nas empowering and\nin the moments where we can beginning to\npractice\nsaying new things to ourself and\nexpanding from that kind of thought\nprocess that can be incredibly\nincredibly helpful\nso speaking of discomfort we have one\nmore question\na question comment question coming in\nfrom debbie\num talking a little bit too about the\ndiscomfort of change\nso when we have debbie cued up\n[Music]\nthank you debbie yes thank you debbie\nfellow philly girl i had a big smile\nwhen i heard your message um\ndefinitely can't hear your accent though\ni'm told we all we all have them from us\nfrom philly\num so thank you debbie grab this\nquestion\nbecause i do see a lot of questions that\ncome up around age around this idea is\nit too late\nalso acknowledging how difficult change\nis\nso first and foremost like i said\nearlier it is\nchange is difficult for all of us humans\nhowever\nwe can change from birth until now we\nknow death\nour brain our body is noroplastic which\nmeans just that\nnew neurons can begin to fire together\nand wire together\nthere was actually a point in time where\nwe didn't know that to be true we\nthought that our brain was fixed we\nthought that our body was\nfixed so very gratefully now we know\nthat there isn't any exploration date\nonce you\ncross 40 or whatever it is you're not\nlocked down in one way of being that we\ndo\nhave our our brains are incredible our\nbodies are incredible\nwe can change up throughout life however\nwhy are most of us stuck in cycles why\nare we unable to change\nthis is what i was describing earlier\nthat i would see week after week in my\nclients\nthe reason why we're stuck lives in the\npower of our subconscious\nour subconscious like i said is\nevolutionarily wired\nand it operates really around one\nprinciple the attempt at keeping\nourselves safe and safety according to\nour subconscious is gained\nwhen we go down the familiar paths when\nwe know what comes next\nbecause the uncertainty not knowing what\nhappens next\nmight invite the threat in that could\nactually cause our physical demise\nlike again all of this is very much\ndriven by our evolution\nso that those imprints all of the habits\nand patterns that we began accumulating\nin childhood\nare stored as our autopilot as that\ncomputer program that runs\nwhen we're not being conscious and again\nwe're geared to stay\nin that familiar despite increasing\nawareness increasing insight increasing\nreasons why not to\naccording to our subconscious that is\nour home that is our familiar base\nand those of us who have tried to change\nhave probably met what i call\nresistance right again like i described\nearlier that\nbody-based agitation where we're\nuncomfortable\nwe feel the energy we maybe simply just\ndon't feel like ourselves\nor some of it it comes for some of us it\ncomes in the mental world\na million thoughts a million reasons why\nnot to\nfor me perhaps for debbie a million\nreasons to\nget off task and to stay off task right\nthat's resistance that's a function of\nour subconscious desire\nright to stay in that autopilot\nto keep us safe or so it believes i\nthink it's chapter two\num in the book we talk about the\nconscious self and becoming aware\nand again that's why consciousness like\nwe talked about earlier is\nso incredibly important because our\nsubconscious\nwants to stay in those ruts right wants\nto stay\nrepeating those conditions that for some\nof us do feel imprinted\nlifelong like we cannot change so the\nfirst part of this\nis to honor why so many of us are stuck\nwe don't actually really want to change\nchange is hard as humans and what comes\nalong with it is incredible discomfort\ni in my brain picture this as\nso your subconscious like you're saying\nand debbie you're i don't know how long\nyou've been on this journey of doing the\nwork but you mentioned that you're 55 so\nimagine\nbeing 55 you've got this perfect\ncomputer program\nin you that is already programmed from\nbirth until now at 55\nyou do have a default you have a\nprogrammed system of your life\nthat is running non-stop for you\nand it takes that when we say\nconsciousness is important here\nconsciousness is\nis crucial because without consciousness\nyou've just got this\nperfectly self-sustaining program\nthere's nothing wrong with it your\nsubconscious is\nis perfect it's doing what it needs to\ndo it's just going to keep\nrunning in this circle on autopilot\nuntil you interject something new in\nyou can't interject anything new in if\nyou do not have or are not practicing\nconsciousness which is just while we say\noh consciousness is important or we may\nsound like broken records\nconsciousness is actually your golden\nticket and your only way in\nto actually rewiring and reprogramming\nthis system that your body has\nprogrammed or your\nmind has programmed for the duration of\nyour life so\nthat consciousness diving in with that\neven just setting an alarm on your phone\ni know we mentioned this in the circle\nthroughout the day where you know an\nalarm goes off and spending 30 seconds\neven just connecting back to your breath\nconnecting back to the present moment\nsomething as small as that little ding\ngoing off and spending 30 seconds with\nyourself and your breathing\nis a way to start to hack into that\nsubconscious programming again there's\nnothing wrong with it\nit's just set in motion and it's not\ngoing to stop unless it's disrupted by\nsomething\nwhich is consciousness yeah so speaking\nof small\ni'm really happy that you use that word\njenna we talk a lot about\nsmall daily promise the habit of doing\njust that\nmaking one small daily promise that you\nbegin to\npractice keeping to yourself not five\nnew small daily promises not changing\nour life from top to bottom tomorrow\nas many of us very understandably want\nto do especially when life feels\nincreasingly uncomfortable\ncontinuing it as it is very logically we\nthink okay well\nfive new things will get me there five\ntimes quicker right to feel\nbetter so honoring you know for some of\nus what\ndoes feel intolerable to continue going\nas is however we want to work with our\nresistance we want to understand\nthat our subconscious does get\noverwhelmed when it begins to tread into\nthat unfamiliar territory so we want to\nset ourselves up to succeed\nto begin to show alignment between the\nintention\nand the action of keeping it so many of\nus suffer from what we call\nhere self-betrayal right a lifetime for\nmany of us of not\nkeeping our intentions of not perhaps\ntying this whole\nconversation beautifully together not\nhonoring not living in alignment within\nour needs right\nintending to do a million things and\nstill living in those old\nhabits and patterns so the way out we\nreally want to show alignment we want to\nshow ourselves now\nconsciously that we do keep those\npromises\nso the action of keeping them small the\nmore\nsmaller the more maintainable the more\nattainable i should say our goals are\nthe better we set ourselves up to do\nwhat keep the promise\nconsistently so we'll be the first to\nsuggest to keep those promises small\ndebbie out there you know feeling like\nyou're getting off track\nyou know maybe scaling back maybe\nrefocusing on a foundation of just one\npromise that you begin to keep for\nyourself consistently\nbecause i know the byproduct of someone\nlike debbie\nor any of us living in self-betrayal we\nbegin to feel very disempowered we lose\nall confidence in ourself\nto a what keep our promises let alone\ncreate change\nright i don't even show up for myself in\nthe ways i want to let alone change and\ncreate a life into the future\nso we have to begin to rebuild that\ntrust in ourself\nand again the way we do it is by\nalignment it doesn't actually matter\nhere's the secret\nit doesn't matter what the promise is if\nyou read the book and if you were on the\nlive event\nlast week i think it was you met ali who\ncreated an incredible new life for\nherself\naround the small daily promise of one\nglass of water\nagain it doesn't matter what the promise\nis it's the empowerment\nthat comes behind living the process of\nkeeping those promises so we want to\nmake the promise\nand practice keeping it despite the\nresistance that will be there and no\ndebbie\nit is never too late to begin this\nprocess\ni debbie this your question made me\nthink of\na quote a friend gave me a journal with\nthis quote written inside of it when i\nwent on one of those\nleft the us and was gone for months on\nkind of like a i don't know i find\nyourself\ni just wrote in a journal and took\nphotos every day for\na while this was years ago i was very\ngrateful to do it but the journal the\npoint of this\nthe quote inside if i butcher it i\napologize i think it's gino diaz and he\nsays\nif these years have taught me anything\nit is this the only way out is\nin and it really strikes me because in\nyour question debbie\nyou end it with you know is there a way\nout and immediately when i heard that it\njust pinged that quote that\nthat was that trip the whole point was\nwhen the friend gifted me that journal\nthey could very wisely tell that you\nknow i was searching for something i was\non this\nthis very external pull when the thing\nthat i really needed\nhence why it was in a journal too was\nreally to go in\nand really to spend time like rapping\nback to monica's question into michael's\nto spend time consistently going inward\nand meeting myself so\nwhen we're talking about this\nconsistency and this small daily promise\nit also circles back perfectly to\nchapter 11\nre-parenting so debbie on this journey\nyou know\nam i i feel stuck or is there a way out\nwhat do i do how do i stay on track\nit's just doing that thing again and\nagain and again we tell our circle\nmembers consistently\nyou know we'll give you prompts in your\ncourse each month and\nif you set to do it for x amount of days\nor every day and you miss a day\nthat's completely fine the important\npart is to then pick it back up again\nthe next day if you missed the next day\nthat's also okay go again the next day\nand the next day and eventually you do\nstart to build that momentum\nwhere it begins to carry itself a little\nbit lighter yeah\nreally really great reminder there too\njenna because when that confidence comes\nyou do you don't fear right falling off\nyour habits um\nanymore right i've gotten to the place\nfor me where there are\nmornings where you know i don't do all\nof the things that i know help me stay\ngrounded and balanced however\ni've consistently done all the things\nenough not done them\nresumed doing them that now i know that\nit i now reframe it as it's a break\nright i might not be doing whatever\nparticular action or daily you know\nchoice it is in this moment though i\nhave that confidence that's what i was\ndescribing earlier i no longer\nfear taking time off or honoring a\nmoment or a morning or a day\nwhere i don't have the resources right\nto do the things that i\nshould be doing um that's a byproduct\nactually of\nof not you know staying committed to our\nhabits from the beginning\nin the beginning there were many\nmornings where i didn't do all of the\nthings and i keep saying morning just\nfor those of you listening because\nthe morning is the time where i can for\nme carve out time in my day\num to do all the things that i know are\nhelpful to me\nin the beginning there were many\nmornings where i did not do them\nconsistently committing to that practice\nthe next morning i had available to me\nhelped me build that confidence so now\ni'll be the first to admit\nespecially when things get busy i tend\nto you know shave things off of my\nmorning routine that otherwise would be\nhelpful to me\ni no longer fear that spiral right i\ndon't longer fear going back to that\npast self and living in all of those\nolder habits\ni know for me that new choice to resume\nis right around the corner so i love\nthat reminder that there actually can be\nsome value\nwhen we miss our habits or when we don't\nkeep\nour promises in the beginning continuing\nto remind yourself that each new moment\neach new day each new morning wherever\nit is that you make those choices\nis a new opportunity to actualize that\npromise to yourself yet again\nand i remembering here too when you're\nspeaking on if you've heard nicole speak\na lot before about neuroplasticity i\nthink this is important to remember when\nyou start to get into\nthat stuck again or debbie you mentioned\nyou know being 55 or however old\nanyone is thinking oh it's too late or i\nstarted too late\nremember in that moment that this\nperfect subconscious programming this\ncomputer system that you already are\nat any given moment you could be 95 and\nyou do still have neuroplasticity where\nyou are\nable to interject this consciousness and\nactually start to create newly and\ncreate a\nconscious life and a conscious practice\nso also just remember that your brain\nactually is\nsomething that's malleable and can\nchange at any given time when you choose\nto\nyeah such a beautiful reminder i mean i\nthink a brilliant point to end on which\nis that we are all\ncapable of so much with within that\nbasis of of consciousness\nright empowering empowering each of\nourselves with\nchoice um within that choice we can\nbegin to honor\nauthentically what our needs are and\nshow up\nin full self-expression so that we can\nbe more intimately and authentically\nconnected with those around us all of\nthis is possible\nwellness is possible in our opinion at\nany age\nif you begin right to create a new habit\nof consciously\ndoing the work to create that change we\nall have that autopilot\nright now we can all gift ourselves with\nempowerment with choice\nwith and for many of us a new say for\nthe first time in our lives where\nwe get to show up as the being who\nconsiders\nwho tends to and who acknowledges\nourselves\nfor some of us for the first time ever\nso for those of you who already have the\nbook\nand are working you worry through it\nlike i said at the beginning this is a\nliving breathing\nyou know practice for i've already seen\nso many of you\nyou know going through it multiple times\npausing on chapters i saw many of you\nacknowledging how difficult some of this\ncontent is reading the chapters having a\nlot of feelings\ncoming up knowing that all of this is\npart of the journey of healing\nhit pause if you're one of those people\nif reading the chapters\nis bringing up some of the deeper\nwounding right pausing there\ntending to it honoring whatever it is\nthat is coming up for you\nthere's no time limit on healing there's\nno linear right trajectory of healing\nand again the work of healing is finding\nthat safety finding those people\nfinding the jenna finding the community\nfor many of us that is part of the\njourney\nfinding the spaces where we can begin to\nexperiment\nwith these new ways of being that's what\nthe work is\nbeginning to practice something that is\nnew\nthat is scary because it's new and that\nis challenging\nbecause it's new though knowing on the\nother side of this newness\nfor so many of us can come such such\nincredible transformation\nso i'm not sure if you have any parting\nwords before we wrap this up here today\ni would just end with you\ncannot rush your healing it will not and\ncannot\nbe rushed and there also isn't like a\ngolden\npot a pot of gold on the other side of a\nrainbow somewhere we were\ntalking the other day and this visual\ncame to mind of really\nwhen we're embarking on a healing\njourney i picture it like a road and\nimmediately past jenna old jenna would\ngo to thinking okay well there's this\nperfect like healing path that i've got\nto go on it has an\nend to it i've got to find this right\npath that doesn't exist so if you're\nseeing a path\nwith all of these things along the way\nthat's not necessarily how it's going to\nturn out you can you can understand and\nshould be able to visualize or practice\nvisualizing\nwhere you're going who you want to be\nwho you truly are\nand then also says surrender to the fact\nthat\nyou can hold that vision and not\nnecessarily have the details of how\nyou're going to get there\nso this visual i have of this\npath i quickly realized in our\nconversation the other day that\nwhile the path doesn't exactly exist the\npoint\nthe way the path is actually created is\nby taking a single step so quite\nliterally if you look down at your feet\nimagine taking\none step forward and a brick forming\nunder it taking another step forward and\na brick forming under it\nyou're creating your own unique path\nas you go and you're doing it through\nconscious\naction so using the tools in the book\nalso at the back of the book there's a\nholistic psychology\nterm glossary so any of the things that\nwe're talking about here too or if any\nwords come up\nwe haven't referenced that much at the\nback of the book you can go to it you\ncan see like neuroplasticity is in there\nit'll explain a bit um that was just a\nside note\nso as you're going just also remember\nyou're creating the path\nas you go it's not to be rushed but it\ndoes take this conscious empowered\nconsistent action i think action is the\nkey takeaway here that it is a doing\nit's how to\ndo the work yeah yeah but no\neveryone out there listening that there\nare so many people walking this journey\nof healing\nright alongside of you you know\nobviously different histories different\nstories\num though sharing i think that universal\nexperience of\nchange and all of that comes along with\nit so know that there\nare if you are you know someone like\nmonica feeling disconnected feeling\nlonely\nlooking for your people again know that\nthey are out there\ncome visit us on instagram and meet all\nof the other self-healers from around\nthe world\nthat are also work walking their\njourneys of healing those of you that\nare in the self-healer circle\nknow that that's a great community to\nbegin to tap into\nthough know that there have to be\nactions right reaching out\nconnecting with these people asking for\nsupport um\nacknowledging the moments where we need\nsupport is how we can begin to show up\nfor ourselves\nas we continue our journeys of healing\nas always it is my honor\nto be walking this journey alongside\neveryone here\nall of you out there
