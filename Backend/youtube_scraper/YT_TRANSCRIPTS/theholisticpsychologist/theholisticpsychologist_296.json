doing even\nbetter now that now that i have you live\non my show you don't know how much this\nmeans to me because when i sent that\nemail that day\ni was not expecting a yes from you\nbecause i get so many notes from people\nbecause i send out requests all the time\nand i either don't hear from anyone they\ndon't hear back or they say oh no sorry\nshe's too busy\nand then you replied me within about 30\nminutes and i walked because i was\noutside on the patio and i walked in and\ni started screaming\ni love that well i commend you for\nasking because you can't get a yes or a\nno without that initial request so\nthank you for giving me this opportunity\ni'm honored\noh thank you so much so much and i love\nthe work you do you cannot\nimagine how much i love the work you do\nbecause it's right on par with what i\nbelieve in\nwhat i've experienced myself with my\nhealing because i've had to heal many\nmany times\nand as people who know me know i'm very\nopen i'm very vulnerable at least now i\nam when i was going through my trauma\ni wasn't vulnerable but now i am i've\ngone through many phases in my life\nnicole that i've had to heal\ni i was born into a really good family i\nhave to say that my dad\ni still say he's my best friend even\nthough he's gone he's no longer alive\nbut everything he sowed into me is still\nreal today my dad was my confidence he\nwas my mentor\nhe was just this soft-spoken wonderful\nman\nso i was lucky to have him in my life\nand my mom was wonderful too but then\ni married into stress\nand chaos and i must say the first few\nyears were okay\nbut i was traumatized towards the end of\nmy marriage\nyou know nobody's fault and i had to\nheal from that it took me a while to\nheal from my divorce\nand i'm doing well now but it took me a\nwhile to really start you know getting\nmy head wrapped around it\nso anyway yes so we all have to heal\nit's a continuous process so i'm sure\nmost of you who are on here\nalready know who nicole is but for those\nof you who don't know i'm going to give\na very short bio\nbecause you can go onto her page to\nlearn about her doctor nicole lopera is\na holistic psychologist\nshe received training in clinical\npsychology at cornell\nuniversity through her very very very\npopular instagram account\nwhere she has about three million\nfollowers and counting\nbecause i think i started following you\nwhen you had about two million\ni went yeah now you're up to three\nmillion and that's because of the\nfantastic\nwork you're doing in people's lives she\nshares tools for transformation and\nhealing and her community is called\nhealers and i've studied using that\nhashtag now because\nit just means so much to me so nicole\nbefore we dive in i have a bunch of\nquestions for you a bunch and i know we\nwill reach everything but\ndo you want to say hi to everyone do you\nhave any words any\nbeginning words you want to see sure for\nsure and i want to thank you ayabo for\nthe work that you're doing you know\nespecially when i hear working with\nchildren\num in particular because i'm very aware\nof\nthe impact that our past has and that's\nhow actually\nhow i've you know kind of done my own\nevolution in\nmy own personal healing and in my\npractice it was really understanding the\nimpact\nfor most of us that those past\nexperiences have\nin big ways you know those of us that\nvery much\nknow the big bad things that happen but\nalso in the small ways\nthat keep us restricted and compromised\nand unfulfilled into adulthood so just\nhearing the breadth of the work that you\ndo and especially knowing\nespecially in the pediatrics you know\nintervening with with children\nit's really meaningful with women in\nparticular for me\num because like i said i truly\nunderstand now the impact\nand how our past we do each and every\none of us\ncarry it into our future so what\nempowers me now\num after my own healing journey that\ndoes continue\nyou know to this day is you know knowing\nthat we can empower ourselves so even\nyou know sharing this work of healing\nif we can just if i can just if you can\njust if we can all\njust empower one human out there to\ncreate change\num that's how i believe we shift really\nas a whole yes thank you for the work\nyou do oh\nthank you thank you thank you we are all\nin this together\nand like you said it's a process it's\ndynamic and every day with that we still\nexist in this world we have to do the\nhealing so let's jump right in\nboundaries i want to talk about\nboundaries we throw that word around\ni talk to women about it all the time\nnicole can you tell us what it really\nmeans to have boundaries and why\nboundaries are so important\nyeah boundary is incredibly important if\nyou would have asked me\nabout a decade ago or threw that word\nout i would have probably had little to\nno idea\nwhat you were talking about what a\nboundary was and i probably would have\nbeen a little bit delusional thinking i\nhad them in my life\nso this is me here saying that this tool\ni view boundaries as a tool for healing\nwas largely\nabsent in my life until i took a long\nhard\nlook at really how i was showing up in\nmy relationships\nand what i came to realize what a\nboundary is\nand what i wasn't having in those\nrelationships were\nto put it really simply i speak in very\nsimplistic terms a limit\nright i didn't really have a limit or a\nseparation\ni came to find in my life between myself\nincluding my needs of my maybe my\nphysical body\nmaybe my emotional needs my spiritual\nneeds i didn't have a separation\nbetween me and others so that's what a\nboundary is\nit's a limit it's our space where we can\ncarve out space\nfor our own authenticity for our own\nability\nto meet the needs that are meaningful to\nus and when we have that limit\nand this is i think what most of us or a\nlot of us are looking for\nthen we get to operate in our\nrelationships more authentically\nand i say most of us are looking for\nthat because most of us\ncome into the work or come to realize\nyou know something's off\nfor us because we're experiencing a lack\nof fulfillment in relationships or we're\nfeeling like they're unequal or no one\ncares about us\ni'm doing all of the giving this is you\nknow dialogue that i've\nthought myself about me and i definitely\nknow others have felt themselves so\ni talk about boundaries now as the\npathway\nto authentic relationships with others\nbecause we are interpersonal creatures\num but again until we learn how to be\nauthentic to ourselves\nwe are showing up in a much more\ncompromised way\nin our relationships absolutely and this\nis a key for women because i talk to\nwomen all the time now that i've been\nmentoring medical students for many\nyears and a lot of the female ones\nhave a lot of problems because they\ndon't set boundaries in their lives and\neven women now\nmarried women single women dating i get\na lot since i got married this year i\njust get\ntons of relationship questions i feel\nlike i'm a relationship coach now but\nmost of those problems are due to lack\nof boundaries\nso nicole give us one or two statements\nas to what\nboundaries sound like let's say there's\na married woman on here like i get\nmessages all the time and she says\nyou know i'm just tired of all the\nemotional abuse i'm tired of all the\nangry words\nthis is you know i'm just stressed out\nin my marriage give us two\nexamples of what you know setting\nboundaries for an abusive husband and\ni'm not saying it's only men that are\nabusive some women are abusive too so\nplease don't get me wrong but because i\nwork with women\nthat's what i deal with so nicole give\nus two examples of statements that are\nboundaries\ni could offer different boundary\ncategories we can start\nthere right so yes some of us can have\nand\nokay again because we all need different\nboundaries depending on what's\nthe dynamics happening in our\nrelationship so some examples\ncould pertain to our physical body right\ntouch commentary right how comfortable\nam i with my physical body and how it's\ntreated\nin this relationship so a woman in a\nrelationship might want to put up\nboundaries around physical touch which\nphysical touch feels\ncomfortable versus not comfortable\nanother area i think that applies\nunder physical boundaries that isn't you\nknow often thought about\nthat extends to how is my body talked\nabout right am i\nam i being sexualized in speech in a way\nthat makes me uncomfortable\nso we have physical boundaries we have\nwhat i call\nmental emotional boundaries right those\nabilities\nstill come on these are very common so\nin that category again really\nsimplistically\nwe have the ability to hold separate\nthoughts from a different person\nto disagree to hold a different belief\nthe ability to have or the reality that\nmany of us have\ndifferent emotions in any given\nsituation i could experience\nsomething right right next to my partner\nand her and i could have a completely\ndifferent emotional reaction to it\nmayan isn't right hers isn't right\nthey're both\nvalid so that's another version of the\nboundary being able to hold space\nto acknowledge that my feeling whatever\nit might be in that moment\nis real is valid as is hers again when\nwe lack boundaries in that area\nright we try to make the other person\nwrong for how they feel or for what they\nbelieve\nin service right of joining in what our\nbelief is\nthat's a type of boundary another really\ncommon boundary\nis what i call resource boundary\nlimits around my time my stuff\nright my emotional resources am i\nactually available\nright for that friend that calls me all\nthe time at all hours event about her\npart her relationship\nnot to say that i don't care to support\nthat friend\nbut am i actually emotionally available\nto do so in the moment do i have\nspace to put aside what's going on in my\nlife\nto hear and support what's going on in\nyours and again a lot of us\nshow up even when we don't when we've\nreached our\nlimit um so i think it's helpful\nespecially for women because you're\nbringing up a really really important\npoint\nwhich is yes we are affected not only\nby the boundaries or lack thereof that\nwe were modeled in our childhood\nenvironment\ni mean that extends out and we become\naffected by\ngender gender roles cultural right\ninfluences and women in particular i\nagree with you especially because i mean\ni'm not a mother myself like you are\nhowever once children come into the mix\nit gets confusing\nand i know for a lot of us women were\ngiven outright messages\ni was as well my mother one of her main\nmessages\nwas do for others love everyone else\nand what i came to realize in in\nkind of observing and witnessing my mom\nthat was to her own disservice\nnever in a way in any space did my mom\nfactor herself\nin and again i think a lot of women\nconvince themselves that we need to i\nneed to put my children\nfirst i'm of the belief if we're not\nmeeting our needs\nwe can't really show up fully in service\nof others\nyes preach right yes yes yes\nthe goosebumps are coming up my\ngoosebumps though yeah\nthey don't often come up but they are\ncoming up yes yes and there were lots of\nquestions about\nwhat if the person you're setting\nboundaries with doesn't respect\nboundaries\nyeah that's hard so i so just to clarify\nbecause i get this question a lot\na boundary is an action we take for\nourselves\nright it's not an ultimatum it's not i\npoint the finger to you\nand tell you to stop doing x y or z well\nthat might be the byproduct what i mean\nwhen i say that\nis what a boundary say for instance the\nfriend calling overnight\ni don't say you know janet stop calling\nme at all hours\nwhat i might say to janet right is if my\nphone rings in the middle of the night\nwhen i'm sleeping\ni will no longer answer it now i'm\nempowering myself\ni'm giving janet the choice to continue\nto call my phone at all hours\nright and if should she the result will\nbe i will be unavailable\nso i i share that to answer your\nquestion because it's\nan act of self-empowerment which means\nwe could get all versions of reactions\nfrom the other person\nright from the minimum of when we set a\nnew boundary especially when it's new\nevery other night i picked up i picked\nup the phone so now on thursday when i\ndon't pick up the phone\nat minimum janet's gonna be a bit\nsurprised where wherever yes why aren't\ni\non the other end and then of course that\nthat reaction\nif janet maybe has her own wounding\nmaybe around abandonment\nnow the reaction could escalate and so\nfor me coming i've done a lot of\nboundary work\nespecially in my immediate family unit\nbecause we had\nno boundaries i come from what we call a\nco-dependent family where there's a lack\nof\nevent right so for me when i started\nputting boundaries up\nactions i was taking for me i did get\nall types of reaction from my family\nincluding\nmy worst nightmare which was\nconfirmation\nthat i was being selfish i would\nactually hear that\nand that's where it becomes our work\nright we have to then\nyou know kind of work through and\nunderstand because\nwhile boundaries when we set them are\ndifficult\nthe long term in my opinion payoff of\nboundaries\nis a much more sustainable relationship\nbecause i've lived the byproduct of a\nhistory of codependency\nand what happens over time i get so mad\nat the person i'm in a relationship with\neven a friendship included for my lack\nof needs being met\nthat i i call them the blame and i say i\nend the friendship i end the\nrelationship\nand i look for the next person that's\ngoing to meet my needs however i'm\nsetting myself up\nto fail right because it never was on\nthem\nit was on me on youtube\nlimits so i say all that to say setting\nboundaries is hard\nwe can't predict the reaction we're\ngoing to get on the other side\nand a lot of times it is our work to\nmaintain\nor to keep the boundary up even when\nwe're getting that reaction now this\ndoesn't mean i saw some comment\nthere are of course situations where we\ncan negotiate a middle that works for\nboth\nparties this isn't an act to be cold\nlike i said this\nover time actually allows us to be more\nauthentic\nand connected to our relationships it\ndoes and it adds to a peace\nit adds to a peace of mind it adds to a\nwell-being\na mental state adds to so much because\ni've had to do that as well\nwith a sibling and you know even if\nshe's listening she understands what i\nmean and\nbecause i'm the youngest in my family\nand i had to do this with an older\nsibling\nbut i just set my boundaries and i\nremoved myself\nand created space and i was you know\nmade to feel like i was the one who was\na problem and i'm this and i'm selfish\nand my parents were still alive and they\ntried to tell me that i should break the\nboundary it's not right and i said no i\nsaid i'm going to keep with it so\ni did that for myself and now we have a\nbetter relationship\nit may not be at the state it was at\nbefore\nbut we now know to give ourselves that\nspace so i love the relationship we have\nnow and when women come to me and tell\nme that i have many women who send me\nstories this long a message is this long\nabout how their sister does this or\ntheir brother calls them names or this\nand that that how do they deal with this\nand i said\nyou let them know that it's not\nappropriate\nand you maintain your distance from them\nthat's a boundary you just say i love\nyou from a distance but i'm not going to\ntolerate that\nanymore there's nothing wrong with that\nso i really wanted to start off with\nboundaries because it really blocks a\nlot of\nwomen from peace of mind and from\nbeing able to just live a you know a\nwonderful\nhappy life so we've settled the boundary\ntalk\nnow let's move on in my work in\npediatrics\num nicole and this is why i really\nstarted my work online after i wrote my\nbook\nfive years ago and published it three\nyears ago and i started to get\nyou know into this online space and\nhelping people helping women i realized\nthat i was\nmuch more valuable doing this than going\nfrom one exam room to the other\nspending 15 20 minutes with every\npatient\nand not really seeing changes because\nninety percent of the problems we deal\nwith in doctors offices are due to our\nmentality\nour mindset uh unwillingness to heal\nyou know it's all preventative medicine\nthat we\nneed to practice but all we're doing is\ngiving our prescriptions oh yeah do this\neat your veggies make sure you go out\nand work out for 60 minutes and then\nthey come back a year after and they've\ngained another 15 pounds so\nyou know we're not really getting to the\ncore of what we need to get to\nso now in pediatrics i notice a lot a\nlot of\npain in kids a lot of unresolved hurts\nand it goes from one generation\nto the next generation to the next\nand that manifests in adults obviously\nand i know this is a really big broad\ntopic but i really want us to discuss it\nbecause people need to realize\nthat their triggers and the way they're\nbehaving now their\nanger their impatience their bad\nrelationships\nis because they're passing on resolved\nhurts from one generation to the next\nso it's an epidemic how do we deal with\nthis\nyeah i'm thank you for speaking all of\nthat i know\ncoming myself too from a very\ntraditional you know medical system that\ndoesn't necessarily you know fully and\nthink in terms of root cause and in my\nfield at least the interconnected and\nyour field too really between the mind\nbody soul\ni know that speaking these truths um you\nknow\nis difficult isn't the most easy so\nevery time i connect with another\npractitioner\nyou know that through their own practice\nand experience this is how i\ncame to these knowings i looked i\nwitnessed i worked with people in\nall different contexts right and i saw\nthese\nuniversal similarities and then i came\nonline and then i started sharing my\nstory online\nand then i saw that now these\nsimilarities were beyond\nthe offices in new york city that i\nworked in in philadelphia that i worked\nin\nnow i'm seeing this resonance\nuniversally um so i couldn't agree with\nyou more and\nyou will always hear me talking right\nabout the effects the language i use\nis of our conditioning all of those\nhabits and patterns\nfrom to start the way again our daily\nhabits the way we care for our physical\nbodies\nall of that is impacted and imprinted by\nthose earliest experiences\nby what we were taught when we first\ncame to this earth experience\nbecause the reality is as a human infant\nwe are completely dependent we can't\nmute our physical needs we we have no\nidea what this whole emotional realm of\na human being has to do\nwe just don't know we need help so in\nthat state of dependency\nand given the brain waves of development\nwe go through all of these different\nbrain wave stages of development\nthat actually prime us to learn little\nbabies with those wide eyes\nthey are quite literally sponges they're\nkicking in the world\nand those first you know depending on\nwho you read those first\nseven plus years are so impactful\nand there's why because we're dependent\nand because we're learning how to\ntake care of ourselves as a human and\nthe where the\nimpacts are everyone around us all of\nthe societies from micro\nto macro we're learning and the\ntools that we've learned in childhood\nthe emotional\noverwhelming experiences that most of us\nhad\neither in those big moments that\noverwhelmed our system\nor in those consistent right areas where\nmy emotional needs weren't met or where\nmy spiritual needs weren't met\nthey really impact us and then because\nof the way our brain\noperates because into\nadulthood and again depending on whom\nyou read\nupwards of 95 percent of our day we are\nrunning in unconscious state we are\nrunning\nfrom our subconscious using the computer\nanalogy right\nwe're running from all of those programs\nthat we laid down in childhood\nand did we learn from humans who learned\nfrom other humans right so when you pull\nback and look simplistically at it\nintergenerational right patterns you can\nunderstand\nhow they come to be because the things i\nlearned\ni'm going to be limited now to teach my\nchild where i'd\nhave one by what worked for me or what i\nknew to do or i didn't know to do\nso we are passing on patterns and that's\nwhy a lot of us when we do\nlook you know those of us with\nconnection with family um\nwe see a lot of similarities and for me\nand for a lot of us this can be\nconfusing\nright because we can start to make make\na meaning out of it or we can start to\nassume\nthat because we see these patterns in\nall of our family that\nthat that that is our lot in life right\nwhile everyone else does it that i have\ni have no choice i cannot create change\num and that's just simply not true\nlike i said i understand now and i loved\nwhen you were talking\nabout your intro and you use the word\nthat i use day in and day out and i\npractice day in and day out\nwhich is consciousness right when we\ncome to consciousness and when we can\nsee\nour habits and patterns we can give\nourself an opportunity\nto actually create change\nyes so now you said a lot there thanks\nnicole but\nhow do we and you said we we look at\nfamily and we all have similarities so\nif there's this\nall these family members from one\ngeneration who want the other generation\nand nobody breaks the pattern nobody\nsays okay\nthis is wrong i don't want to live like\nthis anymore this\nis not right how do we give me one\nsecond\nlet me um um\nyeah i don't there's some people who\njust boundaries they just\nyou know use all this bad language when\npeople are talking\nyeah so yes how do when they have people\nwho are just like them\nall around them how do you break out of\na pattern that you see every day\nthat's the problem i face in pediatric\npractice it's like\nthat's why my work that i do now is so\nmuch more impactful than\nyou know in a building from one exam\nroom to the other because these people\nwhat i call the path mentality that was\nthat question was coming up but it's so\nsimilar to what we're discussing now\nthere's so many people that buy\ninto the pack mentality the herd\nmentality which i say\nyou know is for animals not for humans\nyou have to be able to think yourself\nyou don't have to belong to what\neverybody's saying\nand not sit back and say is this true\nyou know is this really uniting us what\nwhat is this doing people just follow\nthe pack\nso then how do these children and\nhonestly when i see newborns in my\npractice\nand i've been following a family for\nmany years\nand they come in with a newborn in my\nown mind i'm praying for the newborn i'm\nsaying i hope you'll be the one to break\nthis\nbecause i actually feel sorry for the\nnewborn that how are you going to be a\ndifferent human being\nwhen everybody else have seen before you\nhas this mentality so how do we help\npeople to break out of that pattern i\nguess it's all the work you're doing\nright you know it's a process right but\nhow do we help them break out of that\npath mentality um uh\nthinking it's it's a process and it\nbegins\nin my opinion with learning a new\nfoundational habit of being conscious to\nourselves\nso first and foremost we need to\nidentify how often we are\nright i just gave the stat of upwards of\n95 of your day\ni will you'll always hear me speak this\ndon't don't believe me just because\nsomeone studied it and gave that number\nsee for yourself so the first assessment\nself-assessment that would be helpful is\nto see how\nconscious you are how much are you\nshowing up each and every day as if it's\na new day\nas it is and actively making your\nchoices\nbeing a participant in your day or are\nyou like the large majority of us\nmyself included that is actually letting\nthat autopilot run your day\nso the first assessment is how conscious\nam i and a simple tip i give and all of\nus\nat this point walk away with walk around\nall day long right with a cell phone\nthis could be as simple as setting like\nmaybe one or two\nalarms for during your waking hours a\nrandom time during your day you probably\nwill even forget\nthat you set that alarm and when that\nalarm goes off say at 2pm today\ni want you to ask yourself first when\nthe alarm goes off\nwhere was my attention right was i\nfully immersed in what i was doing in\nthe present moment wherever i was\nor was my attention somewhere else\nchances are i know when i began this\npractice and i asked myself that\nquestion\nmy answer was always oh no i was very\nfar away\ni was not here in the moment sometimes i\nwould know where i was and it typically\nwas\nruminating over something that happened\nthat day the fight i had with my partner\nand how i cannot believe that she said\nthat and you know what i should have\nsaid and maybe next time i will or\ni also loved to worry about the future\noh this meeting i have tomorrow and how\nwill that go it'll probably go terrible\nright or like i said i had no idea where\ni was\ni just wasn't present so if you're like\nme\nall right and when that alarm goes off\nif you come to realize\nyou're not present we are given the gift\nof a brain that can fire\nand wire new connections all of our life\nthere was a time in medicine where we\ndidn't believe that to be true\nwe actually believed our brain was done\nchanging i think somewhere into our 20s\ndefinitely by the time we entered our\n30s we now know that's the farthest\nthing from the truth\nour brain it's called it's neuroplastic\nas i'm sure a lot of listeners have\nmaybe heard that word\nsimply means it can change so when if\nyou come to the awareness\nthat i'm pretty unconscious and that\nmeans all of my old programming and\npatterns\nare running my day-to-day which is why\ni'm getting a lot of the same\nright results in my life why it's kind\nof like that groundhog's day\nthat a lot of us are living despite\nsometimes insight\nwhat that means then i need to teach my\nbrain how to be more conscious\nmore often so the second part of that if\ni come to realize that i'm not conscious\nin that moment\ni can begin to use my attention\nand i can use the gift of my senses\nwhat am i seeing what am i feeling this\nis a practice called grounding\nand if i begin to focus on what's\nhappening\nin the given moment right if i do have\naccess to right\neven now i can touch this this you know\nthis hard wall behind me maybe i can\nsmell the aroma\nright i can look at you in this moment\nand now\ni'm in i'm actually firing up a new part\nof my my\nmind my prefrontal cortex probably one\nthat\nhasn't been fired very often because\ni've been letting right my subconscious\nrun the show\nthe more we practice that the more we're\ngiven the gift of choice\nthe more we can begin to observe those\npatterns now from a distance\nit's not to say that they're not gonna\nthey're not gonna go away overnight i\ncan still feel that pull to those old\nhabits\nbut if i begin to create space this is\nhow i get\nchoice i can now begin to make new\nchoices to create a future that's\nactually\ndifferent from our past so being present\nis key\nbeing present is very very key a lot of\nus are not present and i've been there\ni've been there i was there for many\nmany years so when you now start\nrealizing what being present\nmeans and then you're like oh my\ngoodness so this i think the whole of my\n30s\ni probably wasn't present i tell people\nthat my 30s just went by in a flash\nbecause i was so busy with so much i had\njust started my practice\nmy kids were still young my my marriage\nwas going downhill\ni just was going through so much and now\nthat i practice being present i'm like i\ncan't believe that my whole 30s went by\nlike that so\nbeing present being grounded is so\nimportant and we're going to come to\nthis\nlater i said later it's already 1 33\ntime flies when you're having fun\nbut journaling is so important also i've\nused journaling to heal\nin so many situations so many in fact\nthis is how i started writing\nbecause i was journaling so much after\nmy dad passed because i missed him so\nterribly\nbut we're coming back to that you use\nthe word simplistic a lot\nnicole okay and it's funny you use it a\nlot i'm happy you use it a lot\nbecause people actually accuse me of\nbeing too simplistic\nso you know those people who come to\nyour social media and think they can\njudge you\nbut they don't know that i've done so\nmuch inner work\nand i really don't things like that make\nme laugh and i'm like you don't know who\nyou're dealing with and they come and\nthey say\nyou're problematic or you're a problem\nyou're just too simplistic\nyeah and of course i block them because\ni don't my following is\nyou know still whatever thirteen 000 i\ncan still block people because i still\nknow my whole community\nbut they accuse me of being simplistic\nand i post and i tell people that i'm\nproud that i actually have simplistic\nthinking\nbecause i don't overthink and this has\nhelped me so\neven though i didn't have this as one of\nmy questions\ni want you to tell us about what's been\nsimplistic means because i've been\naccused man it's actually from\nfrom a lot of my doctor friends that\nhave had to block\nthey accuse me of being simplistic\nbecause i talk about something or let's\nsay they want me to\npost something about the you know\npolitics they expect me to\nbe totally into you know the democratic\nthinking or the black lives matter or\nthis or that\nand i'm like i'm neither a democrat nor\na republican guess what i am i'm a\nyearbook\nand i just use my brain to think and to\nabsorb i don't belo i'd like some\nrepublican views and i like some\ndemocratic views i vote based on\nwhat i think about the individuals so on\nmy page\ni know you're laughing because there's\nsomething i have on here\nthat people have accused me of bringing\nyou on my show because of some things\nand i'm like\nreally so you know so because i put\nsomething on my page\nthat maybe a trump supporter said but\nit's meaningful like one day if several\nmonths ago i posted\nthis black guy who's a trump supporter\nand he was basically talking about how\nwe need to teach our black kids\nabout respect and i thought that was\namazing and i thought\nyou know nice coming from a black man i\ndidn't care whether he was a trump\nsupporter\ni was listening to what he was saying oh\nmy goodness\ni think there was an earthquake on my\npage that day\noh you're so problematic your thinking\nis too simplistic and they all started\nblocking me blocking me and posting rude\ncomments\nmost of them physicians and i'm thinking\ni'm actually disappointed\nthat doctors with all the training\nyou've had\nyou know you can think this way this guy\nis saying\nsomething that is meaningful or who is\nhe to tell us to respect our kids he\nshould talk to white people first\nand i'm like okay i'd yeah so\ntell us about it i appreciate you\nsharing\nall of that and i'm smiling ayabo\nbecause i can obviously resonate in a\nlot of beliefs\nfrom my own field so you know i think\ni'm gonna go ahead and answer\nanswer i think what a question in there\nwas with an epidemic\nas far as i see it that i believe\nuniversally affects most of us humans\ni think a lot of it is primed by our\nsystems in place\nand that's an epidemic of overthinking\nof\ntrying to rely too much on we have a\ngift we have incredibly\npowerful brains we have the ability to\nthink about thought to view our past and\nour\ndecisions and troubleshoot and plan for\na future\nright we have all of those amazing\ncapabilities\nso yeah we definitely want to harness\nthe power\nof our big beautiful brains however i\nbelieve\nmost of us try to overthink our way\nthrough life\ni believe that our our actual\nwealth of wisdom comes from our\nintuition\nfrom our deeper knowing and it doesn't\nlive in our\nthinking mind so i agree and i think a\nlot of times in school systems\nespecially those of us with the higher\ndegrees we are\nkind of indoctrinated into this\nyou know over thinking um and i and i\nbelieve\nso going back in time to a little over\ntwo years ago\nwhen i started the instagram account it\ntook off\nvery quickly in popularity and i\nunderstand\nwhy and one of the reasons not only the\nuniversal resonance that i was offering\nearlier that these are universal truths\nat least i believe\nit's the fact that for what i'm talking\nabout\nisn't necessarily new i'm giving it a\nnew language i'm explaining it through\nmy lens of experience which may be\nrelatable\nand i believe that it is relatable\nmeaning\na lot of these concepts especially in my\nfield\nwere so out there were so over thought\nthat no one really understood how to\napply them practically or simplistically\nso now because i too am evolved and\ni understand the benefit right putting\nwork on an instagram platform that can\nreach the world\nis going to impact more people it's\ngoing to give more people access\nto these tools than i was able to give\nin my small office\nand i understand that the value because\nthere's language\nyou know difficulties now there's\neveryone speaking their native tongues\naround the world\nthere's value in simplicity and like i\nsaid i think some of it\ncomes from over thinking that most of us\noperate\nin um and also when you think\nsimplistically and when you understand\nhow to action that can be really\nchallenging\nbecause change challenges all of us\nbecause we all\nhave the same subconscious desire to\nremain in our familiar even if our\nfailure isn't serving our long-term\ngoals\nit's protective for us so again another\nepidemic in huma\nin our human world is not wanting to\nchange\nit's a difficulty around the new thing\nso you know when you start to speak\nabout\nempowerment and challenge these\nparadigms that were very much in place\nfor a very long time\nit can start to bring up a lot in a lot\nof us\nyes it does it does it does it does but\nyou know i will i've always\nbeen a simplistic person i was raised to\nbe simplistic\nmy parents are very simple they were\nvery simplistic\nyeah but this is wrong that is wrong\nthey i did i'm just not used to\noverthinking so yes so let's move on\nwomen and their goals and\num their forward movements in life and\nachieving their dreams there was a\nquestion on here but i have a question\non here that i have to deal with with\nwomen all the time\nwomen and their marriages and\nrelationships and significant others\nthere's too many women out there i don't\nknow how to stop my phone from\nlike going to sleep it's a new phone and\nit keeps going to sleep\nbut women are being blocked by their\nsignificant\nothers to be able to move forward and i\ndon't know how\nwomen just stay with abuse for too long\nand i don't know i mean i i can't tell a\nwoman\nfile for divorce or leave this person\nthat's not something that i do there was\na lady on here who posted a comment i\ndon't know if you saw her\nshe said she's pregnant and her\nhusband's been hitting her\nand spitting on her calling her names\nand she doesn't know what to do\nso these are the kinds of questions i\nget from women all the time i want to\nstart this business but my husband\nthinks it's a bad idea\nmy husband says this i feel trapped i\nfeel\nwhat do we say to these women why do you\nhave to stay\nin that kind of situation you haven't\nbeen kept in captivity\nyou know what do we say to them to help\nthem out\ni offer and it goes right on this kind\nof maps onto this concept of the\nfamiliar\ni like to talk about first before we\nshift in terms of change\ni like to offer the reason why because i\nbelieve there is a reason why we become\nvery patterned\neven in our relationships even in those\nrelationships\nthat we know are maybe egregiously\nabusive in some way anyone who follows\nmy work will hear me talk about a\nconcept that i've termed\ntrauma bond or my definition of what a\ntrauma bond is\nreally going back to how i was\ndescribing that state of dependency\nbecause we need others to meet our needs\nand because we are\nwired for interpersonal connection we\nbegin to bond and we engage in\nbonding patterns within the\nrelationships in our core caregiving\nenvironment\nand that's when we start to assume those\nroles that a lot of us\nyou know come to be familiar with i'm\nthe helper on the caretaker i'm the\nperson who does this\nwhat happens before long we become you\nknow we head into school\nand now we have peers and we develop\nfriendships what most of us come to\nto realize when we become aware of\nourself in this new way\nwe tend to play the same roles in our\nrelation all\nof our relationships right we tend to be\nvery patterned\nand so for me that's what a trauma bond\nis\nthat earliest way of being that almost a\ndefinition of self that i've learned\nthrough these earliest relationships\nso if i'm the helper self that's my i\ntake\nownership of that and now i repeat that\npattern\neven if i know that my helping does\nmaybe result in\nabusive type behaviors i pick partners\nwho maybe overstepped my boundaries\nand what and the reason why i talk about\nthe why first\nis because i know a lot of us we can\neither be very critical of ourselves\nright we see these patterns in and out\nof these partners that we're picking\nand they never end well if you will and\nwe\nstart to wonder what is wrong with us if\nyou throw in a very well-intentioned\nfriend or family member that's like hey\ngirl like\nthat's not you know don't you see this\ncoming the truth of the matter is\nwhile on one level of consciousness we\nmight\nthere's that pull again from that\nsubconscious because that's the only way\nwe're familiar with ourselves\nthat's how i know love to feel that's\nhow i know my needs to be met\neven if it's not fully met that's all i\nknow\nso before long we do start to we do\ncontinue in those relationship patterns\neven if again that higher self or that\nconscious part of ourself\nsees it so then the goal is breaking\nthose relationship patterns i share that\njust to acknowledge\nuniversally how hard it is and how\ningrained\nand counter-intuitive a lot of this is\nfor us\nright because some listeners might be\nthe person in a very abusive\nrelationship\nthat just can't step out of that\nfamiliar\nto change so i think understanding that\ncan relieve\nsome of the self-judgment that we place\non ourselves however\nit then leaves us in that same in that\nsame position\nto break those relationship patterns to\ntake those small steps\nwhether it's boundaries right to put up\nif there is active abuse\num over time empowering than ourselves\nto step more fully out of that\nrelationship\nand again it comes to consciousness\nconscious creation\nof new choices in our relationship\nknowing\nthat those new choices will be difficult\nand unfamiliar\nyes but you and i this is all what i say\nto women but it's still hard for them to\nleave as you were talking nicole\nso many women were posting on here but\nit's hard for me to leave i know i'm\nbeing abused but i cannot leave\nyou know why do men use abusive words on\non\non women you know my mother went through\nthis we talk about this topic\nall the time but i just feel like it\njust doesn't change and women will\nmessage you message me\nso they do know that it's wrong for them\nto you know to\nput up with that kind of behavior but\nthey just stay put\nand i again i'm not a psychologist i'm a\npediatrician\nso i think i'm going to start referring\nthem to your page\nwell there's a second piece of it too\nthat i think could often be helpful\nright\nwhich is for a lot of us the fear of\nstepping out of the only relationship we\nknow\nin a sense for some of us that is our\nonly support if you will\nright so a lot of times part of the\nprocess and this is why i'm so\nimpassioned about the community aspect\nof my instagram of the self-healer\ncommunity as well as my in my virtual\nmembership\nbecause a lot of times we do need to\nbegin developing\nthe healthier relationships the more\nsupport of authentic\nones so that we can right over time\nbegin to then step away from maybe all\nwe have\nwhile we're building our pathway to new\nso\nback what i was saying we're\ninterpersonal we do need to heal in\ncommunity\nand i became very acutely aware of that\nas i began to this is all comes together\nbeautifully\nas i began to put up boundaries honor\nmyself more authentically\na lot of my relationships shifted\nchanged and ended\nand i looked around and a big motivator\nfor me to go online\nwas loneliness i looked around and i\ndidn't have many people\noutside of my partner for whom i'm\neternally grateful that she and i were\nmore or less\nwalking in that same healing direction\nat the same time i know not everyone has\nthat gift\noutside of her i was quite lonely so for\nme\nwhen i came and i developed the\ninstagram account i had two\nintentions the first was speaking my\ntruth right i was starting to come to\nthis realization and my own healing\ni was starting to actually affect change\nin a way that i never saw possible in\nmyself and in my practice\ni wanted to share that i wanted to begin\nto put those tools out for even the one\nperson\nthat could resonate not knowing how many\nit would be and\ni was looking for the people so i could\nbegin to build the more authentic\nsupportive relationships so\nback to the question right so for some\nof us\nit is finding those communities it is\nconnecting with the person that might be\non the other side of the world but can\nbegin to be that more\npositive support so as we develop the\nconfidence then to break away from maybe\nthose more problematic patterns\nwe have we have a someone to go to\nand i know a lot of us now are offering\nthese virtual spaces\num so i say that to urge anyone out\nthere\nto begin to make use of that to begin to\ncreate\nthe relationships that are you know more\nfuture based for you\nso that over time you can more conf you\ncan get the support you need while\nnavigating a very difficult situation\nbecause the truth is not all of us are\ngoing to leave tomorrow\nit's going to take some time of doing\nthe work of developing the confidence of\ngetting our own empowerment in place\nand so that could go a large in service\nis finding\nthe helpful supports while i'm phasing\nout maybe these older relationships\ni love that nicole i actually love that\nand that makes so much sense this is why\nthese women\ncome to our pages there's so many women\nwho tell me that that i love following\nyou\nand in fact if they don't see a post\nfrom me for maybe\nbecause now i post three or four times a\nday because i know people want to see my\npost the time i was still posting\nthree times a week they would actually\nmessage me and say doctor yeah\nand we're missing your post so that's\ncrucial i like that answer i love it so\npeople if you're all out there\nand you're feeling pain you're feeling\nhurt you're feeling depressed well go\nand see your doctor we don't want to\nminimize that go and see your doctor\nmake sure you see a mental health\ntherapist out there so this doesn't\nreplace you going to see your doctor\nbut make sure you join a positive\ncommunity\nand you have to do the inner work to be\nable to realize what a positive\ncommunity is that's another question for\nanother day right nicole because\nyou know you could think the people\nthink they're in positive communities\nbecause again they are they all have the\npath mentality\nbut the community they're actually in is\nhurting them more\nso you better do the inner work first\nbefore you attach yourself to any\ncommunity be careful be present\nbe conscious okay moving on social media\nso i'm asking the questions that i get a\nlot i'm trying i'm\ntrying to help my community as much as\npossible now that i have you here with\nme\na lot of people because now we're\ntalking about you know joining\ncommunities online that are positive to\nhelp them\nhowever on the other hand some people\nmisuse social media\nin many different ways and i really want\nyou to\nyou know contribute say something to\nwomen out there\nwho are using social media in a way to\ni guess vents their own hearts\nadvance their own pain and not dealing\nwith their pain before they come on i\ntell some people actually to take a\nbreak from social media when i see the\nkind of things they're posting i'm like\nyou really shouldn't be out here yet go\nand do your inner work and then because\nyou're using this space\nin a way that is you know me hurting you\nand hurting other people\nwhat do we say to them we're not judging\nyou or making you do it but i want you\nto help people realize what social media\nreally is for\nand isn't for nothing i know that's a\nhuge question\nbut you get what i'm saying right\nabsolutely absolutely\nso yeah social media right right now is\nin me it's a tool it's an extension of\nus\nit's an interpersonal you know um uh\natmosphere right we relate to others\nthere's so much\nthat that is in now this very new might\ni add\nexperience of social media in the way\nthat we're experiencing it now\nand even just you know as this 2020 has\nevolved in the pandemic\ni mean for in a lot of ways social media\nis is our interpersonal community and\nyou know it is\nfor many of us our interpersonal world\nand i say all of that\nto highlight right the ways in which a\nlot of us are engaging\nin social media from just the use of it\nhow many hours am i on it what am i\ndoing when i'm when i'm on it what am i\nlooking at when i'm on it\nto how am i engaging with others when\ni'm on it\noften is a reflection of those same\npatterns that we're repeating in our\nreal life\num some of us can by extension and the\nanonymity of social media right\nmaybe you know experiment with different\npatterns though\nmore or less we're gonna see a lot of\nthat same repetition\nso we're gonna see a lot of the pain and\nthe wounding and all of the reactions\nand the ways\nthat as humans we've learned adapt it\nand began to replicate in our coping\nmechanisms play out on social media\nso i say all that to say like you know\nwhat\ndoing the work in in outside of social\nmedia\nwe need to integrate that into social\nmedia being conscious around\nour phone use what are we doing like i\nsaid earlier asking yourself those\nsimple questions\nhow much am i on my phone what am i\ndoing when i'm on my phone\na little deeper question how do i feel\nwhen i'm engaging with what i'm doing\non my phone so many of us blow by that\nstep\nand it becomes a mindless distraction to\navoid feelings\nand or an outlet for particular feelings\num so again we really want to conscious\nsteps into in terms of social media\nawareness\nand consumption allows us the\nopportunity to make\nconscious change um so the first\nsuggestion is to get really clear\nand honest with what is the meaning of\nsocial media in your life and how are\nyou using it\nbecause we're all using it differently\nand then furthermore\nif you come to the awareness that you\nknow i tend to go on social media in\nthis sort of time in this moment i tend\nto look at these things and i tend to\nfeel this way\nif it's not something that you want to\nrepeat then you very honestly need to\nmake\nconscious change in those moments\nknowing that it's going to not be easy\nbecause i still have a habit i'm on\nsocial media quite a lot i run my\nbusiness\ni have to be right and there are so many\nmoments where mindlessly i don't even\nreally want to be on my phone\nand i'm tuning in to just mindless\nscrolling right so it could be\nas simple as wait a minute do i want to\nbe on this device right now and what\nthis could offer me or do i want to not\nthe difficult simple things are often\nclothed with difficulty beneath\nthe difficulty then for most of us is\nwell what am i left to sit in\nwhat feeling was i avoiding what was i\ngoing online to discharge\nthat now i'm stuck with and i have to\nfind a new place\nfor it because for a lot of us that's\nwhat social media\noffers like i said a distraction it\noffers an outlet\nfor certain feelings and it's really\njust another space where all of our\ninterpersonal dynamics and wounding\ncan play out yes so\nguys social media is not for your\nventing yes you can heal from social\nmedia if you've done the inner work and\nyou know what you're looking for and you\ncan\nidentify pages and feeds that are\nactually healing you\nand not making it worse i can't believe\nhow fast\ntime went by nicole we'll have to do\nthis again i know you're busy\nbut after you launch your book and\neverything we have to do this again i\nstill have you don't have to ask me\ntwice\nyou don't have to ask me twice i'll\ndefinitely have another chat with you i\nknow we'll have to do it people are even\nsaying on here we should come up here\nget up come on again together\nso your book is coming out soon how to\ndo the workbook\nright and then you have the future self\njournal\nso i'm a big believer in journaling give\nus a few words about journaling and then\ni'm gonna log off because the\nlast thing i want to happen is to lose\nthis life because this life is like\nyou know it's a goal absolutely i think\nyeah it's working on my\nokay guys sorry nicole to cut you up\nit's going on my youtube channel because\ni'm trying to grow my youtube channel so\ni don't post the video replays\nof my tea time show on my feed so you\nguys are gonna have to go to my youtube\nchannel\nyou're gonna have to subscribe and watch\nthis video yes i'm asking you to\nsubscribe yes you have to\nokay nicole so close us out with\njournaling how important is journaling\nabsolutely so i'll keep it nice and\nquick so truth be told ayabo i\nwasn't a journaler i wasn't in the\ntraditional sense like a lot of us do\nthat gain a lot of value in it\nof journaling my feelings so the the\nprompts and the protocol of journaling\nthat i actually developed\nwas for my own healing journey and it\nwas actually a practice to increase\nmy conscious awareness of the ways i\nwant to be different and create a new\nfuture each and every day\nso i had so much success with it each\nand every day\nmaking a promise right to stick to one\nnew behavior\nthat i wanted to integrate to create\nthat different future that's\nseparate from my past every day showing\nup and writing that intention\nwas incredibly valuable so i gave some\nthinking after i\nyou know had so much of success using\nthis tool\nand i created a set of prompts that i\nactually just released like two weeks\nago\na little more full expanded version of\nit\nso anyone who's interested in a more\nintentional conscious way\nto integrate journaling even if you're a\njournaler and you do a different type of\njournaling this can be very helpful\nyou can sign up for my email list and it\nwill be delivered to their inbox um so\nthat for me was a really i still use\nthat tool\neach and every morning um because each\nand every morning i'm still working to\ncreate change\nbreaking some of those old habits and\npatterns so the link is in my bio\non the instagram here in the link tree\nyou can sign up anyone who's interested\ni'm scrolling down to the way bottom of\nmy new website putting in your email\nand then those journal prompts will come\ninto your inbox and get you started\nwith a new way to consciously journal\nyour way to\nchange
