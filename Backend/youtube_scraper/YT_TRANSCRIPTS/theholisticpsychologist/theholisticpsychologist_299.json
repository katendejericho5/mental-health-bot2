    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole laperra the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you for subscribing\nif you have not yet subscribed and you\nenjoy this video please hit the\nsubscribe button at the end\nso today's video is going to be\non expressing healthy disappointment\nthe reality of it is in relationships\nsometimes we're going to be disappointed\nwith how\na friend a partner a family member shows\nup or doesn't show up for us\nand what's really important is\ndeveloping a\nhabit of speaking objectively when we're\nbringing up disappointment\nin the context of these relationships\nspeaking objectively\nallows us to create or decrease the\nfeeling of threat that can often come\nwhen we are expressing these more\nnegative feelings\nin relationships a lot of us have\nabandonment wounds and when we're told\nor when we're\ntelling someone that we're upset by\nagain an action that they did or didn't\ndo\nit can it can trigger us it can make us\nfeel defensive\nit can make us feel threatened and it\ncan shut us down and what that does\nis it shuts down the communication\nitself\nso i gave some examples that\ncould apply to some context that you\nmight find yourself in\nthat i think would be really helpful so\ni'm going to go through these and then i\nwant to explain the two important parts\nof these statements so one example i\nlove you and i'm\nhurt about what happened that is a\nreally objective way\nto communicate disappointment a second\nway is i understand\nwhy you did that and i hope that you can\nunderstand\nwhy that makes me uncomfortable another\nexample\nwould be i see why that situation was\ndifficult for you\nand i'm feeling and you can insert\nwhatever emotion you might be feeling\ni'm feeling sadness i'm feeling hurt i'm\nfeeling anger\nbecause of how that affected me four\ni hear that you didn't think this would\nbe a big deal and i need you to\nunderstand\nwhy it feels like one for me in this\nmoment\nand then a fifth example is this was an\nintentional i understand\nand it brings up a lot from my past\nconditioning\nso two things i want to point out the\nfirst is what i'm calling a security\nstatement\nso i love you i understand i see why\nthat situation was difficult\ni hear that you didn't think that this\nwould be a big deal\ni understand this wasn't intentional\nthat statement can disarm\nthe person that you're communicating so\ninstead of\ncoming at them in a way that could feel\nthreatening\nthrowing you know you or you did this or\nwhat what's going on here\nthis can set the stage for the\ncommunication\nin a safer way in a secure way\nbecause remember the most important\nperson\nin this two-way dialogue is the listener\nso we're really setting up the listener\nto hear and to be receptive to what\nwe're speaking\nso one way to do that is by putting in\nsome version\nof a security statement all of which are\nprobably true you do love this person\nyou can maybe understand where they're\ncoming from you can understand that what\nthey might have done was not\nintentional so all of these can come\nfrom a very authentic place for you\nand for the listener it can be the\ndifference between\nreacting defensively and actually\nsettling in to hear\nwhat comes next second piece of all of\nthis that i want to point out that's\njust as important if not more\nthe objective communication of what\nwe're feeling\nthis looks different so here i'm hurt\nabout what happened\nobjective statement understand why it\nmakes me uncomfortable\nwhatever i'm feeling because of how that\naffected me again these are\nall objective statements this is\ncontrasting what a lot of us do\nwhich sounds more like you statements\nyou're inconsiderate\nyou're selfish you didn't care about me\nin that moment\nagain the second that we hear if we're\non the receiving end imagine\nbeing on the receiving end of someone\ntelling you what you did or how terrible\nyou\nare it's like we're little kids we put\nour hands in our ears and we don't want\nto hear anything\nfurther from that so when you can word\nwhat happened again\nvery true right these don't have to\nthese are still true statements\ni am uncomfortable right this event is a\nbig deal for me\nyou know this is a problem as objective\nas we can be\nthat again increases the likelihood that\nthe receiver\nis going to stick around to hear the\nmessage\nsomething that i always want to remind\neach and every one of you that this\ntakes practice\nso for some of you that might mean\nactually writing out\nthe communication that you intend to\nhave and practicing it beforehand\nfinal tip when i said beforehand\nmaking sure that you're not in an\nemotionally reactive state\nmeaning if i'm feeling really angry if\ni'm feeling really disappointed if i'm\nfeeling really hurt\nin a given moment probably not the best\ntime\nto make that communication because if we\ndo we might go back into those you\nstatements into that really\nemotionally heavy uh dialogue\nthat could feel threatening to the\nreceiver of the information\nso delaying it giving yourself time\nemotionally to de-escalate\nand then maybe giving yourself time to\npractice and to write down\nhow it is that you're going to make that\ncommunication later\nand then just practice this can go a\nlong\nway in helping us deepen our\nrelationship and allowing us to show up\nmore authentically where we can have\nthese harder conversations\nwe can feel heard and we can also\nallow that others are heard in our\nrelationships too so i hope you found\nthis video helpful"
