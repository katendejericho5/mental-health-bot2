    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lapera the\nholistic\npsychologist here so today's video is\nreally important to me because in a lot\nof ways\nthe topic of being ashamed or carrying\nshame\nreally is foundational in a lot of ways\nto\nwhat holistic psychology means to me so\nwhat do i mean when i say that\nfor a very long time you know as a human\ni felt very\nstuck in a lot of areas of my life\nand by that time in my professional life\ni also happened to have a practice\nwhere i was in the business as a\nclinical psychologist of helping people\ncreate change in their life manage\nsymptoms that they were having\nessentially feel better and years into\nthis practice what i began to realize is\nthat\nall of us myself included were\nsuffering from some version of a\nuniversal stuckness\ni've had very amazingly insightful\nmoments with myself\nmoments with clients where we come to\nall of these realizations we know what\ndoesn't work we know what may work\nyet we can't actualize change and the\nreason why i brought up shame and why\ni'm talking about\nthings not to be ashamed of today is i\nknow a lot of us\ncarry a lot of shame when we see\nourselves being\nstuck in these ways and there's quite a\nuniversal reason why\nthat again like i said was really\nimpactful of me looking at well wait a\nminute\nif i'm in the business of helping people\nchange and i can't help myself\nchange and not really helping my clients\nchange very well what is going on here\nyou know are we missing something\nbecause a lot of us are feeling really\nbroken and shameful\nat our inability to do things\ndifferently this is a helpful reminder\nvideo\nthat i think i wish on some level i\nmight have had at the beginning of my\njourney so i want to\nremind all of you here today wherever\nyou are on your journey\nwhether you're just getting started into\nthe this kind of work of healing\nor whether you're you're in it and\nyou've been in it\nthings not to be ashamed of or repeating\nold patterns\nlike i said earlier there's a reason why\nwe're stuck and that reason lives in the\nsubconscious part of our mind it is\nessentially\nusing the computer analogy that we all\nlove to hate where all of those\nprograms live that take us through our\nday that autopilot\nand the pull we actually have an\nevolutionary pull to keep us in the\nliving those familiar patterns\nbecause for our species sake when we\nknow what comes\nnext we feel safer none of this is\nlogical because a lot of you might be\nthinking yes well i know what comes next\nwhen i\nlive this pattern not something positive\nper se\nor something i'd like to avoid so this\ndoesn't sound logical\nin the language of our subconscious and\nin the language of evolution\nthat which is predictable is safer than\nthat which is not\nso a lot of us repeat old patterns until\nwe become conscious\nto the fact that we're living in\nautopilot and then furthermore\nuntil we begin to make choices to shift\nus out of autopilot\nand that's a process and i'm well into\nmy healing journey now\nthere's still times where my old\npatterns are right beneath the surface\nwhere i almost very realistically see\nthe kind of shift in you know the\nthe split in the road where oh there's\nmy old reaction\nthe thing i always used to do in this\nmoment right there at the ready for me\nso that pattern for me is still right\nthere in some areas\nwith the goal being we make the new\nchoice over time and cultivating\ntaking that new path don't be ashamed if\nyou're someone who still sees your old\npatterns alive and well maybe you're\nliving them day in day out\ni want you to understand that that's\ncoming from that pull of the\nsubconscious it prefers to keep you\nin that familiar which is why none of us\ncould change\nbecause we were battling this part of\nour mind that we weren't even aware\nof being online being as powerful as it\nis\nand we're trying to shift and change\nthat without the right tools\nso those of us repeating all patterns\nnothing to be ashamed of\nit's what you're going to do until you\ncreate consciousness and make new\nchoices to do otherwise\nexpanding on that falling off routine as\nyou begin to set\nnew routines and keep new promises that\npull\nis going to be there there's still days\nit took me a very long time in the\nbeginning of my journey\nto create a new routine there'd be a day\ni'd do it here and there and then i'd\nfall off for three days and then i'd\ncome back to do it\nthose of you falling off routine i would\noffer you the suggestion\nto not beat yourself up not criticize\nyourself again understand\nthat your subconscious wants you to fall\noff routine want you to go back\nto the familiar it understood and was\ncomfortable with\nso it's going to be there kind of asking\nyou so knowing that falling off is part\nof the journey and also\nfalling off gives you the opportunity to\nremind yourself\nthat you have a new choice the next\nmoment so there's\nvalue in falling off because for me\nnow there's still days where i choose\nthis morning being one of them i did not\ndo my full morning routine\nbecause i have a book hanging over my\nhead and what my subconscious does i go\non to do list\nand i picked working on the book as\nopposed to my routine\nwhat's different now i don't fear\nthat i won't return meaning i know\nlikely tomorrow morning\ni'll go right back to keeping those\nmorning routine promises that i know\nhelped serve\nme so falling off the routine and making\nthe choice to get back on the routine\nactually has some inherent wisdom in\nthere for us\nbecause over time very sneakily i can't\neven tell you when it happened there\nwasn't a moment\ni developed that internal confidence now\ni don't worry i know that there might be\nmoments where i don't choose my\nnewer choices toward change where i\nchoose those old patterns i repeat them\ni fall off my new routine\nnow i trust myself to get back so again\nthat comes over\ntime don't be ashamed if you're falling\noff your routine again it's\nit's part of the story of change also\nnot to be ashamed about having emotional\nreactivity\nhaving those big emotions around\nsomething that might be objectively much\nsmaller\nin the present moment those emotional\nreactions\nagain are coming from that subconscious\npart of our mind\nwhere all of our wounds those core\nthings that maybe\nreally hurt us in childhood or living\nand that's the filter that's coloring\nwhat's happening now\nwhich is why there's that mismatch which\nis why the feeling feels so big\nbecause yeah i might be reacting to the\ndirty dishes in the sink this is a\ncommon example i always use so\nthe stimulus right was i'm now screaming\nover dirty dishes\nbut what i realized it wasn't the dishes\nfor me the reason why my\nreaction was so big emotionally was\nbecause for me i had assigned all of\nthis\nage-old meaning about the dishes about\nme not being considered\ncoming from a very deeply wounded place\nin my childhood\nso the emotion that i was having in that\nmoment maybe to my partner who\na lot of times people outside of us are\nvery confused\nbecause we are having an actual real\nlegitimate\nemotional experience though again it's\ncolored by our past and not necessarily\nobjective to what's happening in the\nmoment\na lot of times these two go hand in hand\nso not to be\nashamed about if you still have those\nmoments of emotional reactivity i know i\ndo\nalso if it comes out and you're acting\nout in relationships\nif you see yourself engaging in those\nold condition patterns of withdrawal or\nof explosion\nor showing up as the helper the\ncaretaker when you're trying to shift\nthe way you show up in relationships\nright that acting out those old patterns\nare right below the surface\nwaiting in that subconscious and they're\ngoing to be there\nthey're going to try to live on even as\nyou're trying to change so\ndefinitely don't be ashamed of those\nmoments there's still moments where i\ntake that older path\nin my relationships and then after the\nfact i\nextend the apology acknowledge you know\nthat i reacted in a way that was\nthat was not the way i wanted to show up\nanother thing not to be ashamed of\nespecially because boundary work comes\nin a lot of our healing journeys\nespecially for those of us who struggle\nhaving boundaries as a reminder what are\nboundaries limits\nseparations between where i end and\nwhere someone else begins\nso a lot of us need to begin to\nimplement those limits those separations\nas we heal\nif you have trouble i know i did i\ndidn't even like the idea of boundaries\nit it\nbrought up a panic of what it would\neveryone think of me\nbecause for so long i was so worried\nabout taking care of everyone else\nthat the minute i was introduced to this\nconcept of limits and of caring for\nmyself\nmy subconscious went up my old patterns\ncame i wanted to fall off the routine of\ntaking care for myself and go back\nto being that codependent people pleaser\nso for those of us who\nhave boundary creation or implementation\nas part of our healing journey\nknow that it will be difficult creating\nthose separations are hard those limits\nlearning how to be\nnew in a relationship and show up\ndifferently\nwill challenge that subconscious to sum\nit up the theme here\nit's it's not shameful the reason why i\ntalk about a holistic human\nthe mind body soul and how all these\npieces are interconnected\nand oftentimes dysregulated and\noftentimes being the space from which\nwe're living our current choices\nit's so that we have this level\nunderstanding so that we can over time\nrelieve any shame that we're carrying\nthat's an indicator of our brokenness\nor our inability to change our genetic\npredisposition to be this way\nright know that all of this are signs\nand signals\nthat we're caught up in our conditioning\nand i'm here to tell you that we're more\nthan our conditioning we are so much\nmore than our conditioning\nit's incredibly hard to create change\nthese are\nkind of the pulls that bring us back and\nit's nothing to be shameful for\ni hope you found this video helpful i\nknow for me\nreally understanding so that's the\nsecond piece of this\nyou can listen this video you can get it\nbut when you embody the understanding\nthe next time you see yourself repeating\nthat old pattern you give yourself grace\nright the next time you see yourself\nhaving that or witness yourself\nand that emotional reactivity and extend\ncompassion for that wound that's there\nand very real for you each and every\ntime you can harness\nthe very natural things that happen when\nwe try to change\nand expand again in grace and compassion\nand flexibility usually for yourself\nthe more we can embody these teachings"
