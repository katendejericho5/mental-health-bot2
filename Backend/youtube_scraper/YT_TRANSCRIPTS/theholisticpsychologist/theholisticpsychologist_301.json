    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lapera the\nholistic psychologist here\nso given everything that's going on in\nthe world today i wanted to do today's\nvideo\non re-parenting in times of uncertainty\ntimes of uncertainty for a lot of us are\ntriggering that inner child that deepest\npart of ourselves\nthat we carry with us from childhood and\nuncertainty\nfor a lot of that inner child for a lot\nof us brings up fear brings up a lot of\nother emotions\nbut a lot of us are having a lot of\nfeelings right now\nso i wanted to go over ways that we can\nbegin to navigate this uncertainty for\nourselves\nbecause a lot of you listening are\nprobably noticing one of two things are\nhappening\neither we begin the things that were\nmodeled in childhood the ways that our\nparents took care of themselves say\nwhen they were uncertain or when they\nwere emotional or when they were\nstressed\nright some of us might be noticing we\nare incorporating those same behaviors\nin our life we do the same things our\nparents did\nwhen we're upset not always are those\nthe most healthiest things\nanother thing that a lot of us might be\nnoticing is our inner dialogue\nsome of us are carrying the voices the\nthings that were told to us\noften by those caregivers around our\nfeelings such as you know don't worry\nabout it you're fine what's the big deal\nnot always positive dialoguing right\na lot of us are very critical we have a\ncritical inner voice\nthat's connected to possibly the things\nthat we heard either said to us as\nchildren or maybe we heard our\ncaregivers\nsaying to themselves so those of us who\nare feeling uncertain now\nand any other feeling that we're feeling\nright now we might be\ndragging ourselves through it you know\nwe might not know how to cope we might\nnot know how to deal with it and we\nprobably aren't talking to ourselves in\nthe very nice way\nso i came up with four steps that i want\nto go over\nwith how we can begin to change our\nrelationship with ourselves in times of\nuncertainty so the first thing i think\nis really important and this is a\nreminder and then also practice\nis a reminder and a practice of honoring\nall of the feelings that you're having\nthat your inner child is having\nwithout judgment so whatever's coming up\nfor you emotionally i'm here to tell you\nit's okay\nright if your inner critical voice is\ntelling you something different or if\npeople in your in your childhood\nenvironment didn't\napprove of this particular feeling that\nyou're having now it doesn't mean that\nyou have to judge yourself for having it\nnow\nanything that you're feeling right now\nand anything that inner child is feeling\nright now\nis okay so as you're wise inner parent\nit's important for you to begin to\nremind yourself\njust that that you can see your feelings\nyou can observe yourself having feelings\nwithout judgment they are all okay\nre-parenting in times of uncertainty\ninvolves expanding ourselves and\nallowing us to be\nnice and compassionate regardless of\nwhat we're feeling\nfor a lot of us this might feel weird\nthis is going to be a new experience\nmaybe you were told\nthe exact opposite in childhood that\nthis wasn't okay\nbut it's our job as adults now to be\nthat wise inner parent\nto honor those feelings without judgment\nas much as we can\nso like i said sometimes we just repeat\nthis in our mind and then we turn that\ninto a practice where we actually allow\nthem to be there\nwithout judgment does not happen\novernight but begin by just\npracticing allowing to be what is\nstep two follow your intuitive pull\nright begin to listen to yourself in\ntimes of uncertainty\nwe all have different needs so some of\nus might want to connect maybe virtually\ngiven the context now but we might be\nfeeling a drive to connect with people\nif you're feeling like you want to call\nthat friend call that friend\nif you're not some some others of us\nmight be feeling like we want to\ndisconnect and not really talk to people\nright now\nwhatever it is that you're feeling\nthat's okay this is really a process and\nfirst of all connecting with what you\nneed in that moment\nand then trying your best to create the\nsituation where you can meet that need\nso again this is a process overnight we\njust don't tune into our intuition and\nknow exactly what to do\nbut the more we can start to just ask\nourselves what do i need in the moment\neven if your partner or your best friend\nis needing something else and different\nin that moment\nbeginning to honor what you need in that\nmoment goes a long way\nin periods of uncertainty showing up as\nyour wise inner parent\nfinding your way to the things that work\nfor you listening to that intuition\nallowing that to guide you another tip\npractice doing something for yourself\nthat you enjoy that you know you like\nif you know and if you don't know\npractice\njust start to observe yourself and feel\nyou know when you're going for that walk\nor when you're you know coloring\nyou know on in that book or whatever it\nis that you want to you're doing notice\nhow it makes you feel\nthose of you who don't know what your\ninterests are don't know things that you\nlike that's okay\ni definitely didn't know i actually\nproclaimed when i met my current partner\nthat i had no interest\nthat turns out is not true i have a lot\nof interest i just had to discover them\nso if you're\nreading this one and hearing me say this\nand you don't know what you enjoy if you\nknow what you enjoy\ngo do it make one small promise to\nyourself and\npractice just putting yourself first and\ndoing the thing you enjoy\nif you don't know experiment just try\nnew things and just listen\nthis is that intuition listen to how it\nmakes you feel did i do this activity of\ncoloring and did i feel light and did i\nlike it\nor did actually not like spending time\nin that way that's gonna guide you\nto what you liked the things that are\nimportant for you\nto enjoy even in times of uncertainty\nanother tip placing your hand on your\nheart\nand reminding yourself that you are safe\nwe\nare feeling uncertain a lot of us the\nfarthest thing we're feeling is safe\nwe're not feeling safe\nso sometimes as silly as this might\nsound silly right just putting holding\nyourself\ntaking a deep belly breath and just\nrepeating to yourself and that inner\nbeing that's in there in each of us\nthat you are safe like i said\nuncertainty brings up a lot in all of us\nfear is a big thing it brings up we\ndon't feel safe when we're fearful\ni assure you there's safety and there's\npeace within each and every one of you\nso one time one moment a day when you\nwake up before you go to bed in the\nshower\njust reminding yourself that you are\nsafe will go a long way\nhelping you to repair it in these times\nof uncertainty\ni hope you found these steps helpful i\nknow i'm doing each and every one of\nthese this is an\nevolving process in my life in general\nespecially\nin times of uncertainty so i'm sending\nlove to each and every one of you\npick one start with one and just\npractice this will go a long way in\nhelping you\nto show up as that wise inner parent\nthat i know is inside each and every one\nof you\nyou"
