    "transcript": "today's video is on creating loving\ndiscipline\nfor those of you who watched my question\nand answer for this\nmonth might have heard me talk about\nkeeping those promises to ourself\nor holding ourselves accountable to\nthese new activities\nas we begin a healing journey another\nword that we can use for that is\ndiscipline right making a promise and\nkeeping it\nour perspective around discipline really\noriginates in our earliest experiences\noften in our homes\nyou know watching our caregivers model\ndiscipline or lack thereof\nit also you know incorporates how we\nwere disciplined\nright in childhood or or kept\naccountable\nin the childhood home it also expands\noutside of the home right to our school\nsystems to our community\nand remember as children we are\nabsorbing\nall information about the world and we\nare\nintegrating that in terms of rules\nsystems programs whatever the analogy we\nwant to use is for that subconscious\npart of our mind\nso a lot of us are operating on those\nolder systems particularly\naround discipline right so if you grew\nup in a home\nwhere parents right didn't have\ndiscipline themselves where there was a\nlack of structure\nthis is also the other side of the\nspectrum right\ngrowing up in a home that was over\ndisciplined or overstructured\nthose experiences and all of them in\nbetween can impact\nour adult relationship with discipline\nso\nhow do we begin to cultivate discipline\nloving discipline in our life\nwe have two steps first we want to\nreflect\nright reflect on how these past\nexperiences are coloring\nour relationship with discipline in our\nadulthood\nso we might begin to reflect we can do\nit you know thinking\nin our mind some of us like journaling\nso we could\nwrite reflection thinking about how we\nwere punished\nor how we were reprimanded as a child\nwhen we did something wrong\nright now i'm putting wrong in quotes\nbecause again\nright and wrong is decided upon by those\ncaregivers\nright so when we did something that they\ndeemed inappropriate or you know not how\nthey wanted to see us behave\nexplore with yourself what did\npunishment look like what did\nreprimand look like was it yelling was\nit withdrawal of affection\ni know for me that's how i was punished\nmy mother in particular\nwent upset when she got to a certain\nlevel of upset i should say because it\nwould\nhave to be a an extremer you know thing\ni did wrong if you will\nshe wouldn't speak to me right so that\nin and of itself is a punishment so a\nremoval\ncan also be of course then there's the\nmore typical that we think of the\nscreaming and the yelling\ni urge you to take some time and explore\nwhat it looked like in your childhood\nexperience\nremember also explore environments\noutside of the home right where there\nare moments in childhood that you were\ndisciplined or reprimanded\nin your school right or in your\ncommunity or in some organization that\nyou took part in\nso explore for yourself\nand then begin to look at how this shows\nup in your adulthood\nright begin to ask yourself and reflect\nupon how you\npunish yourself a lot of us internalize\nthese modes of punishment that we were\nmodeled in childhood\nand then when we do something we deem\nwrong or that we feel shameful or guilty\naround\nwe engage in our own self-flagellation\nor self-punishment\nso look at those ways right for you is\nit the\ndepriving yourself of food is it\nrestricting yourself\nto like not do the thing that you wanted\nto do the joyful\nyou know event that you were going to\ntake yourself to do you shame yourself\ni know a lot of us have an inner\ncritical voice does it look like\nconstant\nshaming yourself for the thing you did\nwrong\nnegative thought cycles right that same\nthing ruminating in my mind\nso i urge you take some time explore the\nways\nthat you punish yourself for me i really\nresonate with the restriction\nwhen i've done something wrong you know\nwhen i feel badly\ni tend to punish myself in that way\nsounds familiar\nright i remove something good from\nmyself\njust like my mom removed her the\ngoodness of my mother and that object\nthat\nthat attachment i needed so desperately\nso i do the same\nthing in my adulthood i remove i\nrestrict\na lot of you will find that alignment\nso once we've spent time reflecting and\ni spend time\nwatch yourself for days weeks this\ndoesn't have to be a one-shot thing\nreally look into and observe and reflect\nand spend time on that first step\nand then the action step what then can i\ndo\nchoose one small ritual make one small\ndaily promise\nthat you're going to begin to practice\nkeeping for yourself this is how we\ncultivate discipline\nwe make a promise and we keep it those\nof you who follow me know i often talk\nabout small daily promises\nand that when i do i put such a huge\nemphasis\non the small we want to set ourselves up\nto succeed\nwe don't want to have a five item to-do\nlist as my new thing i'm gonna do and\nthen hold myself accountable\nto do those new five things we want to\npick something\nso small and then practice keeping\nthat promise once we've kept it\nwe want to acknowledge ourselves first\nand foremost observe that we kept it\nwe kept that small promise avoid any\ntendency to minimize it or to criticize\nit right like that punitive parent might\nbe doing in your head\nvalidate yourself acknowledge that you\nshowed up for yourself\nand reward yourself honor yourself in\nsome way for doing that\nit's much harder than it seems\nand then if and when you don't show up\nfor yourself\nbecause creating change is hard we have\nthat pull of our subconscious keeping us\nin those familiar patterns\nso when we don't show up for ourselves\nbegin to talk to ourself\nas a wise inner parent not as a critical\none\nwe can acknowledge that it's okay that\ntoday you felt tired and you felt\ndrained and you just\ndidn't do it we could acknowledge that\nwe will try again\ntomorrow remember this too takes\npractice especially if you're someone\nwho's resonating with that critical\nvoice\nbecause you've lived years now where\nyou've internalized these shame-based\nvoices so as you begin to practice this\nfinal step\nthere's a big party that's not gonna\nbelieve it that's not gonna believe it's\nokay\nthat's not gonna believe that tire is an\nexcuse that is not gonna believe that\ntomorrow is good enough\nso this is where we need to practice\ncultivating a new voice\na voice a voice that honors our\nexperience as opposed to the critical\nvoices\nthat so many of us have internalized so\ni hope you found this helpful especially\nif you tuned in\nafter hearing the last video okay you\nknow if i have a partner if i need to\nlearn how to show up for myself\nin a new way and i don't have people\naround me doing it\nthese are the steps that we want to take\nwe want to begin to cultivate what i\ncall loving discipline so that we can\ncreate\nhabits that can quite literally change\nour lives and those around us\nyou"
