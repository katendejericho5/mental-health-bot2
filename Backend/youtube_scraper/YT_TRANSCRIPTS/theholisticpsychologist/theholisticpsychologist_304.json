    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lapera the\nholistic psychologist here\nanyone who follows my work knows i talk\noften about\ntrauma bonds what are trauma bonds\ntrauma bonds are the patterns that most\nof us repeat\ntime and time again in our relationships\nall of them friendships\ncolleagues family relationships romantic\npartners\nthat we learned in childhood we tend to\nshow up in the same way become the same\ncaretaker that we were\nin childhood and repeat that same\nrelationship model that most of us\nlearned early on\nwith the reality being it no longer\nserves us\nin adulthood i say that to say\nmost all of us every one of us probably\nlistening to this video\nis probably engaging in trauma bonding\nso the question\ni get asked quite often is how do i\nbegin to heal\nso the first step to begin to heal\ntrauma bonding\nis to journal about the cycles that you\nnotice\nyou participating in in all of your\nrelationships\nsome of us listening the video might\nknow right off the bat the cycles that\nwe find ourselves you know\nlistening maybe i'm the caretaker oh\nright i'm always the caretaker in my\nrelationships\nthe caveat here the important point here\nis when we're\njournaling when we're observing ourself\nis to\nfocus on ourself a lot of us tend to\nfocus on\nwhat that friend is doing or not doing\nconsistently or what our partner's doing\nor not doing\nthis is really about us because again\nremember\nwe're the ones that are participating as\nwell in that relationship so\nexploring the cycles understanding your\nown trauma bond patterning creates\nawareness\nlikely you're engaging in that same\npatterning now in adulthood\nwith that awareness we can create change\nthat first step\nis gaining that awareness and remember\nfocus on you\nwhat is the patterning what is the\nmodeling what do you do\nin these relationships across the board\nonce you have some clarity on that\nit would be really helpful to share that\nshare that with\nthe close friend that you trust the\npartner who's you're in a relationship\nwith\nthat family member right i'm using these\nwords very intentionally\nwe don't have to share what we come up\nwith with anyone making sure that we're\nsharing it in a relationship that we\nfeel safe to share it\nis really important sharing it is\nhelpful\nwhen i write verbalize to my partner who\nhas had a different experience than\nmyself\nshe too now can gain awareness or\nunderstanding\nof the patterning that she's\nexperiencing in our relationship\nthat works both ways so it's sharing\nwhat you've come up with when\nyou're exploring yourself when you're\ngaining awareness of your trauma bond\npatterning\nand then it's holding space to hear from\nthat friend that family member\nthat partner you get it about their\nawareness about what happened to them\nand what patterns they repeat from\nchildhood that helps gain understanding\nbetween\nboth participants brings us to number\nthree\nreally helpful step is to ask\nwhoever the other person is what makes\nthem\nfeel safe a lot of us when we're in that\ntrauma bond patterning it's really\ngrounded in a lack of safety\nwe don't feel safe to express our core\nonce our core needs our authentic self\nto\nthat first person maybe it was mom dad\nwhomever and childhood\nand we might not feel safe now so not\nonly is it important\nto become aware for ourselves this\napplies both ways i guess i should\nmention\nbecome aware of what helps you feel safe\nwhat do you need in the moment\nbetween another you and another person\nto create that safety\nand then again being receptive to what\nthe other person might need\nfor safety as well the two might not be\nthe same\nthat's why it's important to ask what\nmakes me feel safe might not be what\nmakes my partner feel safe\nsafety is important number four another\nstep in creating\nsafety when we're activated when that\nwounding from\nchildhood is activated as it is in most\nof our trauma bonding\nwe become emotionally reactive i call it\nwe go unconscious\ni know in that unconscious state\npersonally i have said\nsaid i have done things that i don't\nmean after the fact\nit's really pouring out or exploding out\nright from that wound\nusing belly breathing and space in that\nmoment when we\ndo feel like our emotions are out of\ncontrol goes a long\nway so belly breathing the thing that\ni'm the biggest fan of because we\ntake our breath with us learning how to\nregulate our emotions when we do feel\nourself nearing that point of no return\nand then like i said earlier holding\nspace for the other person\nas their emotions begin to antsy up\npossibly\nin a context where you wouldn't maybe\neven be having that same reaction they\nmight\nand this is where we want to honor that\nspace and that mutual\nregulation which might mean both parties\ntaking a step away\nto calm down and then to revisit\nthe activating event what happened\nessentially at a later time\nwhen we're both more calm\nin the beginning you might still say and\ndo things you don't mean\nand that's okay another video this month\nthat i'm going to put out is going to be\naround shame and the reality is this\ntakes work\nthese steps so in the beginning you're\nprobably still going to be saying and\ndoing things you don't mean\nuntil we learn how to use these\nregulatory techniques until we learn\nwhere that point is for me where i have\nto say\nno partner i need a moment and i need to\ngo regulate myself\nand then i can re-engage this\nconversation\nso the biggest takeaway outside of these\nsteps of course\nare as all things this is a process\nthese trauma bond patterns are patterns\nwe've been engaging in\nfor most of us as long as we've been in\nrelationships with other humans\nso this takes time and these are the\nsteps\nthat if we consistently engage in them\nwe can create\nchange even in our closest most trauma\nbonded if you will\nrelationships"
