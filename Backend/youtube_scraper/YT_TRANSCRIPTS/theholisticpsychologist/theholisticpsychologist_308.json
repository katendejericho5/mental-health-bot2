    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicola pera the holistic\npsychologist here\nmany of you have probably by now heard\nmyself or other people\ntalking about the need to create a habit\nof\ngetting back into our bodies of\ngrounding ourself in\nour bodies of reconnecting with our\nbodies because if you're like myself\nand many others you spend too much time\nin your head\nthinking through our life thinking about\nthe past about the future just\nthinking which results in us being\nreally\ndisconnected from our physical self\nfrom our intuitive center from our\nemotions and from\na big part of what makes us us\nso i get questions when i talk about\nthis okay great\nwhat do you mean when you say get back\nin the body and more importantly\nhow do i do it so if you're like me\nthe first step is really realizing\nhow disconnected you are checking in\nwith yourself\nand if you notice when you do check in\nwith yourself that you're lost in\nthought\nchances are you're spending a lot of\nyour day that way so you probably like\nme\nare quite disconnected and need to begin\nto cultivate\nthis sort of practice of reconnecting\nwith\nour body so how do we do that\nthe first way we can do that is focus on\nour\nsenses right so i'm sitting here in this\nroom\nright now and my senses are are taking\nin\nsensory information right so the sense\nof touch\ni can feel if i bring my attention right\nto the where my legs are hitting you\nknow my butt against the ground\ni can focus on touch and really be\ngrounded in my body\nif you have incense or aromas in your\nroom you can focus on\nsmell right really smelling what it is\nto be in the space if you're outside\nmaybe that's cut\ngrass others what do you see\nright i can see the beautiful color of\nthis mat\nyou get the picture right if we use our\nfive\nsenses that can help us come back into\nour body\nbecause we are being the receiver of\nthat sense information in that moment\nand to be that receiver\nwe're in our body we're using those\nsenses\nanother thing we can begin to practice\nis connecting with the sensations\nnot just our senses our sensations\nwe have energy that's running through\nour body\nif you're connected to it or not it's\nthere\nall day long so cultivating the\nawareness of\nthose sensations right if i do a scan\nright now\nask yourself what do you what do you\nfeel going on in your body are there\nareas that feel\ntight or constricted are there areas\nthat feel\nwide and expansive so for instance i\nknow for me\ni feel a lot of constriction in my\nshoulders and in my upper back i'm\nfeeling a little bit of it right now\nother sensations you might feel an\nenergy or an electricity or a\nzapping prickly feeling for me\ni've noticed i get that a lot in my\nlower legs sometimes i'll just be laying\non my\ncouch and i'll feel almost a buzz\nsensation\nof what feels like electricity it's\nenergy\nin my legs in particular you might not\nfeel it in your legs you might get a\nbuzzing sensation down your arms\nin your back this is the practices of\nconnecting with your body\nand your sensations and we do this again\ntwo ways we either practice reconnecting\nwith our\nsenses and the beautiful information\nthat our body is receiving in any given\nmoment\ncoming back into our bodies in that\nmoment allowing ourselves to experience\nwhat it is\nto be smelling seeing touching tasting\nwhatever's happening in that moment\nand we can also begin to cultivate\nreally understanding\nour body and our energy and how it\nshifts\nand changes and becomes constricting and\nexpanding and tingly intense and\nzapping and expansive and all of the\nthings it's going to be different for\neach of us\nbut this is how we cultivate returning\nto our body and remember as always\nit's a practice i spent so much of my\nlife disconnected\nthat it became a daily consistent effort\nfor me to make these choices to build in\nthose moments throughout my day\nwhere i don't just check in with my mind\nand what i'm thinking about\nmore importantly where i check in is\nwith my body and what i'm feeling about\nand what i can take in and receive in\nthat moment\nthe more you practice the more you\nreturn to your body\nand the more over time you learn how to\ncultivate that connection with that\nintuition that deeper\nplace of knowledge and information and\nwisdom\nand we start by making the commitment to\nbuild one moment in our day where we use\nthis tool\nof coming back into our bodies"
