    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicola pereira the\nholistic psychologist here\ntoday's video is probably one of the\nmost asked about\nand in my opinion one of the most\nimportant impactful\ntools of healing which is shifting what\nfor many of us\nis a lifetime history of reactivity to\na responsiveness so the video is how do\ni\nrespond and not react so first let's\ntalk about the difference between\nreactions and responding\nso reaction a reaction is immediate it's\nknee-jerk\nand it is habitual way of interacting it\nis\nunconscious which is why it's very\npatterned right so thing happens in the\nworld i feel some kind of way\nand i do some kind of thing the more you\nobserve yourself in those moments\nthe more you see how rote how autopilot\nthis\nis meaning how much this all happens\noutside of our awareness\nit's kind of like being done for us like\nit's programmed into us\nso that comparing with respond what does\nrespond mean\nrespond is something that is objective\nand it is a\nconscious way of interacting with the\npresent moment so whereas reacting is\nunconscious right done for us\nresponding is where we get choice\nin particular the reason why i\ndifferentiate these two\nis because so many of us are so used to\nliving in that autopilot in that\nreactive state\nand we feel so shameful about our\nreactions at times i know i do so say an\nexample comes right\ni get a text and whatever it says on the\ntext\nmakes me feel angry right so what do i\ndo when i'm angry\ntypically i do one of two things i\neither lash out of the person that upset\nme\nor i dissociate and i withdraw so say\nfor instance here i come\nand i lash out right and then this\nescalates because the person i've lashed\nout to well chances are they're gonna\nhave something to say right so now i'm\nfinding myself in a conflict\nand i know me i'm not i'm not always the\nmost savory character when i'm in a\nconflict i say and do things that i\ndon't mean from that emotional place\nwhat happens after the fact for me at\nleast as i'm sure it does for a lot of\nyou\ni feel really shameful because i feel\nlike i've experienced myself in this out\nof control way\nsometimes i don't really even agree with\nmost of the time let's be honest\ni don't agree with what i said and done\nso now i carry\nshame with me it's really difficult\nbecause that reaction in that moment was\nreal for me\nright it was in that unconscious pathway\nthat was running\nmy show or my you know that was deciding\nfor me\nso cultivating responsiveness\ncultivating a space between the thing\nthat happened so the same text\nand a space for me to show up\nresponsively to choose\na new action is what is incredibly\nimportant so i want to acknowledge this\nis a process\nright meaning this doesn't happen\novernight but here are some steps\nto get us started in the process the\nfirst step\nreally simple much easier said than done\nis pausing\neven in this society right where\neverything is a mile a minute and i can\nimmediately beam a response back or\nreaction back\nchoosing not to sometimes time\nis our best friend in these scenarios\nright so when that text came in to me\nmaybe i put my phone away before i go\nand shoot that\nmean text right back sometimes time is\nthe difference to allow my emotions to\ndown regulate enough\nto create that space where now i can\nchoose to respond in a new way\nthe second thing we can do is begin to\npractice objective\nobservation right separating ourselves\nand beginning to\npractice acknowledging what is actually\nhappening in objective terms this is\ndifferent than\nthe stories we've told ourselves about\nwhat's happening\nso friend texts and says objectively\nwhat friend says\nnot the meanings that i want to assign\nto that which is oh this person doesn't\ncare\nyou know how dare they they don't\nrespect me those are stories so what is\nobjectively\nhappening it's really learning how to in\na sense like hover\nand kind of explore observe the\nsituation\nin a new way that for a lot of us is the\ndifference between a response and a\nreaction\nif we over time color what's happening\nless and less we don't assign those\nmeanings\nwe can have more space then to choose a\nnew response\nin a future another thing we can begin\nto practice\nis focusing on our own breath chances\nare you're emotionally activated when\nthat thing happens\nright that's not going to go away\nimmediately so by bringing our attention\nthose of you who know i'm a big fan of\ndeep belly breathing maybe we give a\ndeep belly breath or two\nthat'll do two things it'll give us a\nfocal point for our attention\non our breath that's not in our mind in\nthese stories\non the phone over there that i just have\nto go now pick up right i'm focusing on\nsomething different so i'm doing\nsomething with my attention not\nfeeding the stories that are gonna\ncreate the emotions more and more\nand it might even regulate those\nemotions\nbringing you back to that calmer place\nwhere responses\ncan be generated and then the final step\nis to forgive yourself\nwhen you go back to those old reactions\nbecause it's you're human\nand you will like i said when i started\nthis this is a process\ni spent a lot of time knowing this\ndifference and knowing these tools\nbefore i was able to consistently apply\nthem\nand there still are moments where i\nindulge those older reactions\nso this isn't linear we don't just read\nthis and do differently\nthis is really about cultivating these\ntools to create that\nspace and offering ourselves grace\nwhen those old reactions rear their\nheads\nas they will"
