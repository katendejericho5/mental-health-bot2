    "transcript": "hi everyone dr nicole lepere the\nholistic psychologist here\nas always thank you to each and every\none of my subscribers out there the\nnumber is growing it's incredible\nthose of you who are not yet subscribed\nif you like this video please feel free\nto hit\nsubscribe at the end so i get a lot of\nquestions\na lot of the time about how the heck do\ni\nstart okay there's all these great tools\ni know all these new things that i\nshould do\nbut how do i get going so i wanted to\ncreate this video for you\ncalled a morning of the work really\nhighlighting now i'm gonna say\nstart in the morning the reason why i\nthink mornings are helpful\nfor those of us that have a million\nthings happening in our external world\nis many times the morning is the only\ntime\nthat we can have space just for\nourselves\nbefore our partners wake up before our\nchildren wake up before we have to do\nall the things we have to do\nfor many of us the morning can be the\nspace\njust for us that doesn't mean that we\nhave to do this\nonly in the morning so if you're someone\nwho it's not the morning for you\nif there's time in an afternoon or in an\nevening\nthat is more intuitive for space for you\nand you can carve\nout that space for you at a different\ntime go ahead\nthe important practice here is for many\nof us\ncreating space it could be even just 10\nminutes that's what we're going to start\nwith\nwhere we can begin to fill that time\nwith\nthese new behaviors to help us heal\nso what are three steps if you are going\nto do this in the morning or really\nany part of the day especially if this\nis a new habit\nyou might want to start by setting an\nalarm right setting an alarm if it is in\nthe morning for\n10 minutes earlier than you typically\nwake up if it's in the afternoon or an\nevening\nsometimes this alarm is our reminder oh\nthere's this other thing i want to do at\nthis time\nbecause initially this isn't going to be\nyour habit we already have the things we\ndo first thing when we wake up\nwe roll over we look at our phone\nwhatever it is so\nthe newness of this this alarm can help\nit can\nbring to our conscious mind the fact\nthat i want to do something different\nso set that alarm use that reminder\nonce we wake up then a lot of us gain\nvalue from having a space that's carved\nout for whatever we're going to do\nwhatever behaviors activities new\npractices we want to put in that space\nthis could be our own space it could be\na corner it could be\nsmall for those of us that have limited\nresources\nbut having a place to go that's ours\ncan create the intimacy\nthat is really helpful with for\nourselves separate from the rest of the\nworld\nso if you have a nook cranny set it\nup this will be the place where you go\nand you dedicate this time for you\nso when the alarm goes off and the space\nis created\nthis is where it's hard now it's our\ndecision we have to make the choice to\ngo\nto go to that space and to use that time\nso in the beginning this might mean\nyou're just going and taking yourself to\nthat space for you for 10 minutes\nthat is so incredibly important in that\nspace over time you can begin to\ndo those new things that you want to do\nwhether it's breath work or meditating\ndon't do them all at once creating the\nspace\nsetting the intention going and carving\nout that\ntime for yourself is such an important\nfirst step so don't overlook it\ndon't focus so much on what you're going\nto do in that space\nreally just spend some time cultivating\npresents within your life\nfor you so if it's the morning a morning\nin the work\nset that alarm 10 minutes earlier when\nthat alarm goes off go to that space\nthat you've created for yourself\nand even if you only spend that 10\nminutes just sitting with yourself in\nsilence that's a great start\nand then over time you can begin to keep\nthose small daily promises within that\nspace\nto do all of the beautiful new things\nand create all of the beautiful new\nhabits\nthat's going to help you create the\nfuture that you want\ni hope you found this video helpful and\nas always thank you for tuning in\nyou"
