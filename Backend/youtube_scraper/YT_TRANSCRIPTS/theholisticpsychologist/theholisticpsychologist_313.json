    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Perry the\nholistic psychologist here so today's\nvideo I just want to highlight some\nreally important things for you all to\nknow as you begin or continue on your\nhealing journey so the first thing first\nimportant reminder that I want to offer\nyou for your healing journey you\nprobably hate me for this reminder but\nthe reality is there are no quick fixes\nthere is not one new thing that we're\ngoing to do life doesn't change\novernight healing is a journey there are\nsmall steps that we can take each and\nevery day to progress toward healing but\nI assure you there are no quick fixes\njust think about it how long have all of\nus for some of us it's been decades that\nwe've been living life in this familiar\nway so when we look ahead towards\nchanging it it's not gonna happen\nquickly and it's not gonna happen\novernight I'm always a bearer of this\nbad news but this means for me as well\nhealing is a journey remember\nhealing is a journey of patience\nbringing me - there are no timeframes\nthere is no when is this done or about\nhow many years get a lot of these\nquestions and I understand we're\nuncomfortable we want to know how\nquickly we get to feel better there are\nno universal timeframes there's no\namount of days weeks or months that I\ncan or anyone can assure you that this\nwill be done or over and there is no\nright timeframe healing looks different\nfor everyone so timeframes don't exist\nit is about following our own journey\nand healing at our rate another thing I\nwant to remind you it's really easy and\nthis might not even seem like you're\nhealing healing begins when we begin to\nkeep promises to ourselves small\npromises I always talk about small daily\npromises that is healing I had an\nincredible community member whose\nhealing journey started with a small\npromise of one glass of water you might\nbe listening saying a glass of water\nisn't really healing but it is healing\nbegins with one small promise something\nelse I want to assure you\nis that these small choices add up these\nsmall progresses add up over time if you\nkeep those small daily promises these\nsmall choices they create transformation\nso that community member who started\nwith one glass of water built on that so\nwhat might not seem like you're doing a\nlot or enough in the beginning is still\nmovement toward progress which brings me\nto another reminder there is no enough\nthere is no falling off\nthere is no I'm not keeping up all of\nthese are ego stories none of this\nexists so if you hear yourself thinking\nI'm falling off I'm going backwards I'm\nregressing my friend is doing better\nthan I am\nI assure you none of that is true we all\nheal in our own timelines so there is no\nfalling off there is no where we should\nbe you are where you're at for a reason\nanother reminder consciousness creating\nthe ability to be present snap out of\nthat autopilot is where all change\nhappens showing up consciously gives us\nchoice to break all of those patterns so\nthose of you who are practicing\nconsciousness daily know that you are\ndoing so much towards your healing and\ntoward creating a future that's\ndifferent and that's transformative\nsomething else I want to remind everyone\nabout their healing journeys is that\ntrauma lives in the mind and the body\nwhich why for so many of us only\naddressing one area of healing doesn't\nwork for me included I try talk therapy\nit wasn't enough I had so much trauma\nhoused in my body that until I began to\npractice yoga meditation breath work and\nmore body based healing I still was\nstuck and a lot of us have trauma so if\nyou are carrying around the trauma in\nyour body or in your habits please know\nthat we have to address all of you that\nthis these body based habits of\nregulating our nervous system through\nbreath work or through yoga are\nincredibly important so for those of you\nout there who are feeling stuck and\nmaybe not utilizing those especially if\nyou have a trauma history begin to make\na small daily promise toward one of\nthese tools it goes a long way\nwe are traumatized in our body and\nthat's a lot of the reason why only\naddressing one area is not helpful I\nhope these reminders support you on your\nhealing journey and I assure you there\nis no right or wrong wrong way you are\nright or you need to be"
