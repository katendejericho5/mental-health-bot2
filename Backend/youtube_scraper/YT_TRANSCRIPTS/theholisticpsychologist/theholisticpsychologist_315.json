    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres here\ntoday's video is on the ego and in\nparticular the egos favorite stories so\nwhat is the ego the ego really simply is\nour story of us the story our beliefs of\nwho we think we are those of us who have\nbeen practicing what I call objective\nobservation of our internal world of our\nthoughts write really simple if we pay\nattention to our thoughts all day but we\nare finding out is that our ego is\ntalking to us all day long and it tends\nto tell us the same stories all day well\nI want to remind you that the ego\nbelieves it is protecting us by keeping\nus in those familiar stories if it can\nanticipate a future that's similar to\nits past the ego believes it keeps us\nsafe however what begins to happen is we\nget stuck in these very familiar stories\nthat aren't helpful to us those of us\nwho have experienced any version of\nabuse the big t the little T oftentimes\none of our core beliefs about ourselves\nis a version of I'm not worthy\nnow these stories these ego beliefs are\nthe lens in a sense that we are viewing\nour entire current experience which is\nwhy for so many of us we can't change\nthose beliefs we're stuck in them or\nbringing these past beliefs and we're\nrecycling them into our current\nexperience and we cannot create change\nso what are some of the beliefs if you\npay attention to those thoughts that you\nmight be seeing or hearing you telling\nyourself all day long\nso the first one again is another\nversion of that I'm not worthy or I'm\nnot good enough any iteration of that a\nlot of our egos like to tell us that\ntype of story another really common\nbelief is that people may be a specific\nperson and are doing better than me all\nright so now I'm comparing myself down\nhere is everyone else doing better in\nwhatever area in all areas of life\nanother really common ego story is I am\nbehind in some way now insert whatever\nway in my career in my relationship and\nhaving children and how successful or\nunsuccessful\nI am again I'm comparing myself not\nfavorably down-right this these people\nare achieving this level of success in\nthese areas that I am NOT another really\ncommon one often times in our\nrelationships it's a deep belief that no\none will love me\nanother one is that someone insert maybe\nit's everyone else is more attractive\nthan myself and a final one is I can't\ndo what other people do again some of us\nget really specific we can't do one\nthing\nsome of us globalize it and we believe\nwe can't do anything that other people\ndo we can't life the way other people\nlife so some themes you're gonna see in\nhere right\ncompetition comparison that's the voice\nof the ego when we are feeling at threat\nwe really go into this us-versus-them\nmentality where everyone else that's not\nus\nthat's them feels a threat to us so what\ndo we do we go into that kind of\ncompetitive mode where we try to\nmaintain our sense of self or the story\nof who we are by putting other people\ndown so those are the themes that you're\ngonna see in here this competition this\ncompetitiveness and again all of these\nare born out of these ego stories it's\nbest attempt at trying to keep us safer\nin the unfamiliar but that ultimately\njust keeps us stuck so I share this with\nyou if you're experiencing any or all of\nthese you know common ego stories I want\nto normalize that I want to offer you\nthat so many of us are and I also want\nto acknowledge that these are just\nstories these are not who you are these\nhave just becomes too practiced you've\ntold yourself this for too long a lot of\ntimes based on very real past painful\nexperiences our first step to creating\nchange is identifying the separateness\nthat these stories exist and are painful\nbut they're not who I am there's more to\nwho I actually am so I hope you find\nthis video helpful we are all telling\nourself stories all day long the first\nstep to creating change is acknowledging\nthat they are just stories\nyou"
