    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here I get a lot\nof similar questions from you guys out\nthere in the community so I've decided\nthat each month I'm gonna start doing a\nQA and I will pick one question and\nanswer it so begin to leave your\nquestions in the comments and I will go\non each month and grab one and answer\nyour most frequently asked questions so\nthis month I get this a lot question is\nwhat is the difference between the ego\nand the inner child so the simple answer\nis the ego protects the inner child what\ndo I mean by that each of us have an\ninner child that lives in us it is the\nhouse where all of our past experiences\nall of our unmet needs all of our\nsuppressed emotions where that lives it\nlives in our mind and it is the lens\nthrough which we experience our current\nreality the ego is the protector of that\ninner child it is essentially the story\nof our self of who we are as a human of\nhow we show up in the world of how we\nare in relationships it is the story of\nus that we are most familiar with that\nwe formed based on those earliest\nexperiences that protects us from those\ndeeper deeper wounds that we have so\nthey are related we carry around this\ninner child this childlike wound part of\nourselves into our adult life and that\nego functions to keep us safe\nnow remember when I use the word safe I\nreally need familiar for our minds\nsafety is in that which can be repeated\nin that which is familiar so this story\nof us is just the story we're familiar\nwith it is the story that we've\ninternalized to keep that child as safe\nas we can so I hope that clarifies our\nego is our protector of that wounded\ninner child that we each have I hope\nthis was helpful and I hope this\nclarified and remember leave more\nquestions below and I'll pick another\none for next month"
