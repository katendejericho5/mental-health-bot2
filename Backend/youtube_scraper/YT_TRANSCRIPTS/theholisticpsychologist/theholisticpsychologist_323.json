    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here so today's\nvideo is on small acts of self-care\nthose of you who follow me and might\nhear me talk often about what I call a\nsmall daily promise and what that is is\nan intention to do one new thing that's\nquite literally very small each day and\nthere's a reason why I put the focus on\nit being a small daily promise or a\nsmall act of self-care and here's the\nreason why each of you listening as a\npart of your brain that's called the\nsubconscious and what is stored in there\nare all of the habitual daily behaviors\nthat we engage in all of our heart our\nhabitual thoughts and all of our\nhabitual feelings and as humans we are\nincredibly habitual creatures I jokingly\ndescribed it as we each have a little\navatar that's of us that is the familiar\nus that lives in that subconscious so\nwhy am i explaining this to you because\nwhen you set an intention to do\nsomething new so say tomorrow say you\ndon't drink a lot of water so your your\nnew promise to yourself is you want to\nup your water intake so tomorrow you're\ngonna start drinking water sounds simple\nright logically you might know all of\nthe benefits of why you want to add a\nnew habit and water drinking into your\nday tomorrow when you go to drink that\nwater your subconscious is gonna\nregister it as unfamiliar it's very\nblack and white or our subconscious\nthings are either familiar things we've\ndone before things that are deemed\ncomfortable and safe for us or they're\ndeemed unfamiliar new things things that\ncould potentially be unsafe or\nthreatening and the main motivator of\nour subconscious is to keep us safe so\neven if logically that that glass of\nwater is is a safe thing and it's a\npositive healthy thing when you go to do\nthat your subconscious is going to just\nthrow it into that category of\nunfamiliar and it's gonna be really\nuncomfortable and you're gonna be really\nresistant to doing that so small steps\nare it's important it's already gonna\nfeel uncomfortable to do one new thing\nso the higher the expectation bar you\nset for yourself the more you just set\nyourself up\nto not meet that expectation one small\nthing is hard enough don't overwhelm\nyourself because that's what happens\nshowing up in a new way is going to be\nuncomfortable to begin with the more\nuncomfortable it is the less likely I'm\ngonna keep showing up in that new way so\nI give five five examples five quick and\neasy the first one I already spoke about\ndrinking one glass of water I have a\ngreat story of a longtime community\nmember now her name is Allie so Allie if\nyou're listening you're so incredibly\ninspiring because her incredible change\nnow that has been over a year of began\nwith one promise to drink one glass of\nwater everyday she's built onto that\ndaily habit now and does journaling and\nmeditating and is really creating some\nchange in her life but it started out\nwith one glass of water so some other\nexamples those of you who want to get\nyour sleep a little more balanced or get\ninto a sleep schedule maybe just going\nto bed 15 minutes earlier I didn't say\nan hour I didn't say two hours maybe\nultimately you want to go to bed an hour\nor two hours earlier but it can start\nwith just 15 minutes it can start with\nfive or ten minutes even another example\nis taking a bath maybe you're someone\nwho wants to dedicate some time to your\nself-care in this new way so it could be\na small promise of a bath a week even 10\nminutes of stretching those of you who\nwant to begin to have some movement into\nyour life it can really start with as\nlittle as just 10 minutes set a timer on\nyour phone sit on the ground and just do\na couple stretches and five minutes of\nmeditation it could be one minute of\nmeditation even point being keep the\npromises small because change is hard\nenough as it is we want to set ourself\nup to succeed and not to continue to\ndisappoint ourselves by putting the\nexpectation bar up way too high so I\nhope these practical examples are\nhelpful grab one exactly as it is or\nmake up one of your own but just keep\nthose promises small and then notice\nnotice every time you kept that promise\nfor yourself because I assure you it's\nnot going to be easy doing new things\nnever are I hope you found this video\nhelpful\nyou"
