    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Niccole a pair of the\nholistic psychologist here so something\nthat's been coming up in a membership\nthat I run is a lot of people beginning\nto talk about how they're comparing\nthemselves to other people such as oh\nI'm not doing the work as fast I'm not\ngetting this as quickly as maybe I'm\nwatching other people in the membership\nyou know work with the concepts I'm\nbehind I'm not doing enough these are\nall examples of stories that are created\nby a part of our mind that we all have\nas humans that is called the ego the ego\nloves to compare what it thinks who it\nthinks that we are ourselves to other\npeople it compares endlessly those of\nyou that are aware of the thoughts that\nyou're having all day long\nwe are all having thoughts all day long\nmight be aware of this type of story\nthese comparison stories where I see may\nbe objectively or what I imagined\nsomeone else to be\nand then I obviously compare myself\nusually down meaning I'm less than I'm\nnot as good as they are I'm not as far\nalong I'm not as successful really the\nlist goes on these are stories of\ncomparison our ego like I said likes to\nhave us separate from them these stories\naren't helpful when you're doing the\nwork which is lifetime this healing\njourney and these tools that we talked\nabout using together every time I'm\npresenting content these are our tools\nfor life now meaning there's no end\nthere is no done there is no race to\nthis imaginary finish line it's about\nshowing up each and every day so these\nthese stories that our ego likes to\noffer aren't helpful because what\nhappens I mean how long can you hear\nthis story telling yourself I'm not\nshowing up enough I'm not good enough\nI'm not doing this right how long can I\nkeep hearing that and keep showing up\nprobably not that long and a lot of us\nare telling ourselves or are listening\nto these stories that are being offered\nby our ego so I am here to assure you\neveryone listening that you are right\nwhere you need to be wherever that is\nyou are right where you need to\nbe no two people's journeys are ever\ngonna look the same even myself and my\npartner who I've been walking side by\nside in this healing space with our\njourneys definitely didn't look the same\nthere were many times where I thought my\nego tried to tell me she was further\nalong than I was it's not helpful that\ncan be really demotivating so if those\nstories are there when those stories are\nthere this is something else I want to\nacknowledge these don't go away our ego\nis gonna try to offer us those\ncomparisons is going to we're gonna hear\nthat what we want to do is just observe\nokay there's my ego story again\nthere's my lesson story again there's my\nnot good enough there's my there doing\nbetter than I am story again\nand then I shift my attention away so I\njust note it it's there I don't feel\nbadly that it's there it's what my egos\nbeen doing for as long as I've been here\nthus far so why would it stop now it's\nnot going to so the practice isn't just\nobserving it acknowledging that it's\nthere and then putting your attention\nsomewhere else anywhere else on your\nbreath on what you're doing the more\nattention you give to those stories the\nlonger they stay around and the more bad\nyou end up feeling about yourself and\nthen before you know what you stop doing\nall the things you are not less than you\nare not too slow we're right where you\nneed to be so I hope this video was\nhelpful for any of you out there that\nare living under this endless endless\nstories of comparison and feeling crappy\nabout it remind yourself just this\nyou're right\nwhere you need to be I promise you I\nhope this video was helpful\nyou"
