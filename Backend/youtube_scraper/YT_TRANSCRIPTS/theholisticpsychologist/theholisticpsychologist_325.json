    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you for subscribing if you have\nnot yet subscribed and you enjoy this\nvideo please hit the subscribe button at\nthe end so today's video is going to be\non expressing healthy disappointment the\nreality of it is in relationships\nsometimes we're going to be disappointed\nwith how a friend a partner a family\nmember shows up or doesn't show up for\nus and what's really important is\ndeveloping a habit of speaking\nobjectively when we're bringing up\ndisappointment in the context of these\nrelationships speaking objectively\nallows us to create or decrease the\nfeeling of threat that can often come\nwhen we are expressing these more\nnegative feelings in relationships a lot\nof us have abandonment wounds and when\nwe're told or when we're telling someone\nthat we're upset by again an action that\nthey did or didn't do it can it can\ntrigger us it can make us feel defensive\nit can make us feel threatened and it\ncan shut us down\nand what that does is it shuts down the\ncommunication itself so I gave some\nexamples that could apply to some\ncontext that you might find yourself in\nthat I think would be really helpful so\nI'm gonna go through these and then I\nwant to explain the two important parts\nof these statements so one example I\nlove you and I'm hurt about what\nhappened there's a really objective way\nto communicate disappointment a second\nway is I understand why you did that and\nI hope that you can understand why that\nmakes me uncomfortable another example\nwould be I see why that situation was\ndifficult for you and I'm feeling and\nyou can insert whatever emotion you\nmight be feeling I'm feeling sadness I'm\nfeeling hurt I'm feeling anger because\nof how that affected me for I hear that\nyou didn't think this would be a big\ndeal and I need you to understand why it\nfeels like one for me in this moment and\nthen a fifth example is this wasn't\nintentional I understand and it brings\nup a lot from my past conditioning\nso two things I want to point out the\nfirst is what I'm calling a security\nstatement so I love you I understand\nI see why that situation was difficult I\nhear that you didn't think that this\nwould be a big deal I understand this\nwasn't intentional that statement can\ndisarm the person that you're\ncommunicating so instead of coming at\nthem in a way that could feel\nthreatening throwing you know you or you\ndid this or what what's going on here\nthis can set the stage for the\ncommunication in a safer way in a secure\nway because remember the most important\nperson in this two-way dialogue is the\nlistener so we're really setting up the\nlistener to hear and to be receptive to\nwhat we're speaking so one way to do\nthat is by putting in some version of a\nsecurity statement all of which are\nprobably true you do love this person\nyou can maybe understand where they're\ncoming from you can understand that what\nthey might have done was not intentional\nso all of these can come from a very\nauthentic place for you and for the\nlistener it can be the difference\nbetween reacting defensively and\nactually settling in to hear what comes\nnext second piece of all of this that I\nwant to point out that just as important\nif not more the objective communication\nof what we're feeling this looks\ndifferent so here I'm hurt about what\nhappened objective statement understand\nwhy it makes me uncomfortable whatever\nI'm feeling because of how that affected\nme again these are all objective\nstatements this is contrasting what a\nlot of us do which sounds more like you\nstatements you're inconsiderate you're\nselfish you didn't care about me in that\nmoment again the second that we hear if\nwe're on the receiving end imagine being\non the receiving end of someone telling\nyou what you did or how terrible you are\nit's like we're little kids we put our\nhands in our ears and we don't want to\nhear anything further from that so when\nyou can word what happened again very\ntrue right these don't have to these are\nstill true statements I am uncomfortable\nright this event is a big deal for me\nyou know this is a problem\nas objective as we can be that again\nincreases the likelihood that the\nreceiver is going to stick around to\nhear the message something that I always\nwant to remind each and every one of you\nthat this takes practice so for some of\nyou that might mean actually writing out\nthe communication that you intend to\nhave and practicing it beforehand final\ntip when I said beforehand making sure\nthat you're not in an emotional really\nreactive state meaning if I'm feeling\nreally angry if I'm feeling really\ndisappointment if I'm feeling really\nhurt in a given moment probably not the\nbest time to make that communication\nbecause if we do we might go back into\nthose use statements into that really\nemotionally heavy dialogue that could\nfeel threatening to the receiver of the\ninformation so delaying it giving\nyourself time emotionally to de-escalate\nand then maybe giving yourself time to\npractice and write down how it is that\nyou're going to make that communication\nlater and then just practice this can go\na long way in helping us deepen our\nrelationship and allowing us to show up\nmore authentically where we can have\nthese harder conversations we can feel\nheard and we can also allow that others\nare heard in our relationships too so I\nhope you found this video helpful\nyou"
