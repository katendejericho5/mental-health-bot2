    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here so I talked a\nlot about ego work this video is going\nto be on the four stages of awakening to\nthe ego so first and foremost what is\nthe ego the ego is and whenever you hear\nyourself thinking or talking and you say\nthe word I whatever comes after I is a\nstatement based on the ego it's this\nconceptualization really of Who I am\nmaybe of who others are in the world\nmaybe it's the conceptualization of who\nand what the world is it's a it's a sort\nof self definition the reality being\nit's only part of ourselves it is not\nwho we actually are who we are is\nsomething that's called consciousness\nit's the ability to observe this part of\nourselves so how do we begin to break\nout of living life in ego the first\nstage is what we're calling the lack of\nego awareness it's when we're\nunconscious so many of us aren't even\naware that we have this part in our mind\ncalled the ego we just think that the\ndefinition that we've been operating\naround is who we are and is how things\nare in the world for us we are often\nreactive we feel very defensive when our\nstories are challenged so a lot of times\nthis looks like if I have a belief about\nthe world and someone across from me as\na counter belief about the world I can\noften feel threatened by their belief\nbeing different from mine sometimes it\nlooks like outward reactivity arguing a\nlot of emotions get touched when our\nsense of self when our definition of\nself our ego definition of self is\nchallenged so this is what we think of\nwhen we think of life being lived\nunconsciously before we awaken so what\nare we awakening we're weakening to the\nconsciousness that is us bringing us the\nstage to which is when we come to\nrealize that we do have an idea of who\nwe are we do have a story about\nourselves others in our world in the\nworld at large we are being you're\nrepeating that story many of us\nthroughout our day all day long\nso this stage is when we come to the\nreality that we have an\nColonel dialogue that is separate from\nwho we are who are we the witness sir of\nthat endless story about our self\nthroughout the day so once we wake up\nand we see this is the first opportunity\nwe're seeing our thoughts and what a lot\nof us are saying is they're very\nrepetitive and they tell ourselves the\nsame narratives over and over again\nusually based around the story of who we\nare\nonce we've woken in that way what we're\nwaking is the consciousness I am the\nconscious observer that's who I am\nthe next stage we evolved into is what\nI'm calling the witness or consciousness\nso what that allows us to do now is to\nhold ourselves in that awareness space\nso when we're in the stage two we often\nare still reactive we know we're telling\nourselves stories when that person does\nthat thing but I still can't stop the\nreaction that follows you know I either\ndetach dissociate however I take care of\nmyself or I do something external I\nscream I yell whatever so this we're\nstill in that reactive State so when we\nevolve to stage three we're able more\nand more to maintain that position as\nthat conscious observer\nso what we're evolving to is even if I'm\nin some triggering situation and I can\nsee my stories my ego is telling me oh\nyou know that person's disrespecting you\nthis is where you kick and scream and\nyell I'm able to stand in my awareness\nand make a new choice this is where I\nevolve to what we call responsiveness so\ndoesn't mean though that my story's not\nrunning doesn't mean that I'm not\ncompelled to kick and scream and yell\nand tell this person how wrong they are\nI probably am this just means I have\nmore space now I'm able to say well you\nknow what while that's great ego thank\nyou I'm going to respond in this new way\nthe fourth stage and this is ultimately\nlife goal in a sense that some of us you\nknow might be able to evolve into and\nnot all of us this is what we think of\nwhen we think of enlightenment ego\nintegration where we are able to\nmaintain the awareness that we are just\nconsciousness where we are we are\nless and less shifting back into the\nstories and into the reactivity I lay\nthese out in stages however it's not a\nsequential process we don't check the\nbox of one and then we don't evolve into\nto more often than not once you evolve\nand you develop the habit of observing\nyour thoughts so what you'll start to\nfind is you fluctuate between stages two\nand three or sometimes now I go right\ninto ego reactivity and other times I'm\nable to maintain that more responsive\nspace so none of this is sequential once\nwe pass one stage we don't we're not\nforever going to not go back sometimes\nwe go back and forth between these\nstages it's a constant evolution but ego\nwork is incredibly important because a\nlot of us are identifying with stories\nthat are not who we are we are quite\nliterally such an expansive conscious\nawareness that has choice in each and\nevery moment we just have to practice\ncultivating that choice I hope you found\nthis video helpful"
