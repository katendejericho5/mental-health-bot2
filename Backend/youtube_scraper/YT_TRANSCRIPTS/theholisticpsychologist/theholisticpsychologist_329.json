    "transcript": "hi everyone doctor Nicola para the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you to each and every one of you\nfor subscribing so today's video is\nincredibly important it's on such an\nimpactful practice which is how to\nbreathe through a trigger so first and\nforemost what the trigger the trigger is\nan emotional activation often it's the\nresult of unmet needs emotional wounds\npast events some of them traumatic that\nwe carry with us and then we use those\nevents those experiences to assign a\nmeaning to things that are happening in\nour current environment what we feel\ninternally then is a really big feeling\nit's really intense for some of us it's\noverwhelming and then typically what we\ndo is we react emotionally from that\nplace in a really simple way it\ntypically goes one of two paths the\nfirst path I kick and scream I do\nsomething outward I write that nasty\nemail back I scream you whatever I\ndo something out or this is really\nsimplified of course I go inward I\ndetach I know my disassociate those two\ncoping mechanisms for a lot of us are\nold they were formed at a time where we\ndidn't have any other choices with how\nto navigate the situation so for\ninstance and they're the result of very\nreal accumulation of feeling so I'm\ngonna use an example so say you're\nsomeone who has a critical mother and\nnow you've heard the criticism of this\nmother for the entirety of your life so\nfar so it's any given Sunday and you're\nover at mom's and mom makes a critical\nremark inside you want to scream and\nyell and lower brains I mean you were\nfeeling something really big right\nobjectively it was maybe a one-sentence\nremark why is what you're feeling inside\nso big like I was saying earlier it's\nbecause it's now become the accumulation\nof every critical thing that mom said\nmaybe you're taking it to mean that mom\ndoesn't respect you or value you or\nthink you're lovable right all of these\nassessments are now being made which is\ncontributing to why you feel so big\nemotionally inside likely what's\nhappened for a lot of us then is we\nreact like I said in one of those ways\neither scream and yell at mom and now\nthe two of you or\nknockdown blow out argument or if you're\nsomeone like myself maybe you distance\nor dissociate err you know you kind of\nlike check out a bit to navigate that\nreally painful situation and I describe\nthat because the emotions are having or\nreal and they're valid and they've for a\nlot of you been carried across your\nlifetime so far so we have to honor\nthose and for a lot of us that means\nthat we're our nervous system is being\nactivated which is why we feel it in our\nbodies feel energetically some of us\nfeel our heart rate goes up we're\nactually having a physical or\nphysiological experience which brings me\nto the power of the breath in these\nmoments so using our breath can be an\nincredibly helpful tool to bring our\nbody back into physiological balance to\nregulate our nervous system to help calm\nthe very real activations that are\nhappening in our body\nthose of you been following me for a\nwhile now I'm a big fan of a belly\nbreath as simple as hand on belly\nlearning how to breathe really deep\ninflating my belly in all the way out it\nsounds simple but as you begin to\npractice it might feel weird it felt\nvery weird for me at first I wasn't used\nto breathing out of my belly I was used\nto being a very shallow chest beast\nbreather as many of you will be which\nbrings me to the suggestion of\npracticing practice all the time\ndon't just wait for when you're feeling\ntriggered - oh right that belly breath\nlet me try to do this now two things are\ngonna happen you're they're not gonna\nremember you're not gonna be good enough\nat it to gain the value of it which\nmeans make a small daily promise\nsomewhere in your day anywhere in your\nday and just practice five deep belly\nbreaths so that when you're in that\nactivating situation here's where you\nuse it and here's why I talk about the\nbelly breath in particular there's a\nmillion different types of breath works\nbut I like this one because when mom's\nsaying her comment and I'm having all\nthe feels inside if I just take one two\nthree breaths in that moment or if I go\nto the bathroom and take them in the\nbathroom wherever the living room taking\na walk if I use my breathing I can help\ncalm my body's response\nwhich gives me then the opportunity I\ncan break the pattern of thing happens\nand I react right away and if in that\nspace thing happens I'm feeling if I can\nlearn how to regulate my body create\nthat space bring my emotional system\ndown what I now will have the\nopportunity to do is respond in a new\nway so instead of screaming and causing\nWorld War seven or instead of detaching\nand associating I might choose to do\nsomething new in that moment and then\nthe value of that is when I leave that I\nget to feel empowered when I leave that\ncontact so that exchange with mom I\ndon't have to feel shameful and bad\nabout that older reaction because I know\na lot of us do if I kick and scream or\nif I dispatch and associate I'm left\nfeeling bad after the fact I'm left\nfeeling shameful why did I behave like\nthat so the more we can create that\nspace and use our breath to give our\nbody the balance the more we're going to\nthe opportunity in that space to say or\ndo or navigate that in a better\nhealthier way for all of us I can leave\nthat situation feeling empowered and I\ncan feel better about myself overall in\ntime because as you know I have to end\non the reality that this doesn't happen\novernight\na lot of the spaces that we're feeling\ntriggered are like I said being carried\nemotions wounds really hurt parts of our\nself that are consistently being\nactivated but if over time I learn how\nto use my breath to harness that power I\ncan begin to create empower choices even\nin the most uncomfortable emotional\nenvironments so I hope each and every\none you found this video helpful if you\nhave not yet subscribed and you like\nwhat you heard please hit subscribe at\nthe end thank you so much"
