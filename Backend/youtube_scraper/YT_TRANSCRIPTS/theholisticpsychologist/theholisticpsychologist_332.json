    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you for tuning in so this week I\ndid a post on the isolation period of\nhealing and it resonated a lot so I'm\nfollowing up with a video about the\nisolation period of healing some of you\nmight know this or have heard it\nreferenced as the dark night of the soul\nfirst we're going to talk about what it\nis and then we're going to talk about\nwhat to do so first and foremost what is\nit I'm gonna use my own example my own\ndescent if you will into the dark night\nof the soul as an example through all of\nthis so what it is is quite literally\nwhen our soul is screaming out after\nwhat for many of us is a lifetime of\nliving in a conditioned way detach\ndisconnected from the authentic being\nthat we are so what this looks like for\nme was a couple years ago I started to\nsuffer physical symptoms I was faint I\nwas having headaches all the time I had\nno energy I just didn't feel great at\nall in my body emotionally it was a very\nhighly reactive anxiety that I was used\nto my whole life was starting to spike\nagain and in terms of my soul I just\nfell dull and hopeless and quite\nhonestly disenchanted with life in a lot\nof ways what I came to realize when this\nstarted to happen came to realize that\nthis was all happening because I was so\nout of alignment I was a lot out of\nalignment in the way that I was living\nin terms of the lifestyle choices that I\nwas making it was out of alignment in\nterms of the work that I was doing I was\nout of alignment terms my emotional\nworld\nI wasn't acknowledging it at all I\nwasn't showing up as an authentic me or\nreally even as a version of me at all I\nwas so disconnected from myself in my\nrelationships so all of that\nmisalignment resulted in all of those\nsymptoms that I was having it almost\nbecame hard to function for me\nin that time so I went into what I would\njoke and call hermit mode I didn't want\nto be and around people I didn't want to\nbe an external environment than someone\nwho's always been a very social person I\nhave a lot of friends I like to go out\nlike to be in the world experience the\nworld and I was feeling and at this\npoint of a flow of darkness I was a\nfarthest thing that I wanted to do and\nI'm here to tell you that this is a\nnatural part of the healing journey as I\nbecame more and more aware of those\ndeeper parts of myself and how\ninauthentic I was living I needed to\nstep away from the way that I was living\nin the areas that I could step away to\nreconnect and first to discover the\nauthentic self that I was not attuned to\nso it's necessary for many of us a lot\nof us like myself don't really have\nchoice in some of the areas we can't\nmaybe step away if we have families or\nchildren or if we're the the income\nearner in the household like I was so\nwhat this looked like for me was still\ndoing the things that I had a new to\nkeep life evolving and then to honoring\nthis period of isolation on my own time\nafter hours on my weekends so what do we\ndo what did I do\nfirst and foremost we have to accept\nthat this is a natural part of healing\nand they say that cuz a lot of us are\nreally hard on ourselves especially\nthere's productive go-getters out there\nlistening we want to do we think\nsomething's wrong if we stop a lot of us\nlive in cultures and societies where\nwe're told not to stop that it's lazy\nkeep going push forward so acceptance is\nintegral saying no this is actually part\nof what I'm going through and like I\nsaid earlier there's such there's value\nfor a lot of us and going inward to be\nable to separate my voice from all of\nthe other internalized voices that I was\nliving with for so long to get that\nclarity I had to shut off all the voices\noutside of me to be able to reconnect\nwith myself so acceptance is such a key\npart of it don't fight that you're there\nand like I said for those of you\nlistening or like myself if there are\nstill those boxes that you have to\nyou have to go make rent you have to go\nshow up for your children in some way at\nleast right accepting that in the times\nwhere I have choice so for me on the\nweekends outside of client hours I\naccepted that I needed to hit a full\npause and I did that that leads me into\nsurrender surrendering means letting it\nbe because when I stopped and a lot of\nyou might have this experience my inner\nvoice was screaming at me not to stop\nwhy are you stopping you have a million\nthings to do you have to go a lot of the\nreasons why I was showing up in my\nrelationships or because I was afraid of\nstopping what if I don't show up and\ncare take or provide or help these\npeople around me will I lose these\nrelationships so what I was surrendering\nto is the actual stop and grounding\nmyself in that place of pause meaning if\nI'm sitting on my couch and I'm thinking\nabout all the places I should be I might\nas well just be all of those places so\nmoving my attention and giving myself\nthat permission to actually reap the\nbenefits of stopping was a really big\nbig part of the healing place so\nsurrendering surrender also means we\nbecome more and more aware for some of\nus of the relationships that we've been\nkeeping with to really simplified of\ncourse to trajectories that could happen\nI go inward I just don't have the energy\nto give to my relationships as I evolve\nin my healing journey I get more energy\nand I want to socialise again back I\ncome and I reengage with my friendships\nor my relationships another possible\ntrajectory that a lot of us will live is\nI heal I evolve in healing that maybe\nI'm ready to be about the world again\nbut I'm starting to have awarenesses at\nthese relationships that some of us have\nheld for a lifetime have to change\neither I have to show up differently in\nthese relationships or have to stop\nshowing up as frequently or at all\nthat's a hard part of the surrender for\nme evolving my relationships and ending\nmany more of my relationships was an\nincredibly differed difficult process of\nsurrender meaning I had to honor my own\ngrief I had honor what it was like for\nme to step away\nthese relationships took more and in\ngrieve the loss of them and to become a\nnew person and then there was loneliness\nto some extent and I know a lot of you\nfrom your comments are feeling similarly\nI wanted to find my people so it takes\ntime and patience so when we're\nsurrendering a lot of us are\nsurrendering to a new reality in terms\nof our relationships once we exit this\nisolation period then a really practical\ncomponent of this is self-care right\nit's so important when we're healing in\nthis way when we're in this period of\nisolation to make sure we're keeping up\nand feeding our body and resting our\nbody and doing the things that help to\nnourish us there's a lot of energetic\nrelief that happens in this time for\nsome of us it's age-old emotions\nputs our bodies through the wringer so\nwe have to make sure that we're sleeping\nwell we're eating well we're doing\nbreath work we're meditating we're\ntaking the walk we're being in nature\nwe're getting Sun we're just doing those\nsimple acts of self-care to nourish our\nbodies and nourish our emotions that are\ncoming up and out for many of us during\nthis period so I hope you find this\nhelpful this is a journey there's no set\nmarker of when this ends I got a lot of\nquestions on well what am I done with\nthis period you know it depends on the\nperson it depends on the depth of\nhealing that we're diving into it's\nnecessary like I said so accepting it\nsurrendering it to what it is\nsurrendering to what it means about our\nfuture and making sure we're caring for\nourself keeping those small daily\npromises will get us through this period\nhowever long it takes I hope you guys\nfound this helpful if you did and you\nhaven't subscribed already that would
