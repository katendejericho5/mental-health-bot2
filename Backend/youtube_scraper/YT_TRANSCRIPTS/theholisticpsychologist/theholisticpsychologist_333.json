    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Pyrrha the\nholistic psychologist here as always\nthank you all for tuning in today we're\ngoing to talk about being misunderstood\nand the practice of teaching ourselves\nhow to be misunderstood I talk a lot\nabout this concept of misunderstanding\nespecially when we're going through a\nhealing journey for a couple reasons as\nwe begin to heal those of you listening\nmight be engaging in new self-care\nbehaviors you might be showing up\ndifferently in your relationships in\nterms of boundaries you may be diving in\ndeep and doing some inner work and\nuncovering older wounds that we've\ncarried with us and in the process of\ndoing that you might start to show up\ndifferently in your world and that can\ncause reactions from other people not\nalways positive reactions a lot of us if\nhumans are so driven to be understood\nunderstood by those around us but\nsometimes in healing we're not going to\nget that feeling of misunderstanding so\ntwo steps of how we begin to practice\nbeing misunderstood the first invaluable\ntool is observation this time we're\nobserving the messenger the other person\nso say for instance using boundaries as\nan example if I know a lot of you out\nthere are beginning to experiment with\nnew boundaries in your relationships\nespecially when these relationships are\nlong-term sometimes when we show up\ndifferently we do get a kickback or a\nnegative reaction a lot of us can take\nthat personally we can feel at least I\ncan feel bad my way to removing that\nboundary completely what can really help\nis me stepping back so if I do get a\nnegative reaction from whomever I try to\nput a boundary up in this relationship\nand they have a negative reaction\nremember that person might be I know\nthis person I can explore within myself\nokay well how how do I imagine this\nperson shows up to their other\nrelationships is this a person who\nunderstands boundaries themselves the\nanswer is no then that could relieve me\nof the pressure if they don't know\nboundaries for themselves and aren't\nusing boundaries from themselves how can\nI expect them to use and understand\nboundaries in my world and in\nrelationship with me\nwe can't this applies to anything\nanytime you're seeing or getting that\nreaction and feeling not understood by\nsomeone\nchances are it's because that someone\nisn't using the tool or the concept or\nisn't healing in the same way that you\nare for themselves so to afford someone\nelse understanding more often than not\nwe have to get it ourself and not\neveryone is going to be living the same\njourney so as we practice as - as a\npractice i titled the whole video\npractice because this doesn't happen\novernight we have to retrain ourselves\nout of our initial reaction to step back\nand to practice observing the other\nperson observing the moments of what\nthey're not able to understand usually\nwe can find the reason why again it's\nbecause they aren't using the tool\naren't doing the things show up the same\nway in all of their relationships\nanother deep deep process to practice\nbeing misunderstood is cultivating a\npractice of radical acceptance because\nmost of us start in this mode we desire\nthis idea of sharing a reality with\neveryone around us especially those we\nlove meaning we prefer to have agreement\nin our thoughts or our beliefs we prefer\nto be able to understand emotion symbol\nlike we've really preferred us to have\nthe same emotional reactions as a lot of\npeople that's when we really feel\nunderstood the reality of it is though\nwe won't ever all exactly share the same\nreality so our goal is to evolve\nourselves into being able to tolerate\ndifferences you know tolerate\ndifferences in even an intimate\npartnership and what my partner thinks\nor believes in what I think or believe\ntolerate differences in an event\nemotionally affecting both of us\ndifferently right so I might not always\nmirror the same emotional reaction that\nmy partner does in the same moment and\nthat too is okay again this is a\nlong-term process the more we can begin\nfirst in ourselves to tolerate different\nrealities different occasions where I\nthink one thing and then maybe I think\nsomething in opposition in another\ncontext if we practice within\nself first then we can evolve to this\nsituation where I can tolerate you\nhaving different belief systems you\nhaving different emotional reactions to\nthe same event that I'm living and\nthat's okay a lot of us strive for this\nfor for a feeling of validation because\nif if you're mirroring back to me that\nwhich I think or that which I feel I can\nfeel a little bit more secure in my\nbelief or my feelings but again if we\nevolve to were all different humans we\nactually can have incredibly fulfilling\nrelationships if we can learn how to\nseparate and tolerate within our self\ndifferent realities and within\nrelationships with others at different\nrealities again reminder this is a\npractice these two steps don't magically\nincorporate they're not magically\nincorporated into our life overnight and\nthey don't create change overnight but\nif we can cultivate a practice of\nobserving the people that are\nmisunderstanding us we can gain\nawareness of why they might be reacting\nas they are and if we can evolve\nourselves from the need to share a\nreality with those around us to the\ntolerance and the flexibility to allow\nfor separateness we can really evolve\nand tolerate being misunderstood which\nis going to be a part of the journey for\nmost of us so much more smoothly so I\nhope this video brought value to you and\nif it did and you're not yet subscribed\nit would be awesome if you hit the\nsubscribe at the end thanks so much"
