    "transcript": "hi everyone Dr Nicole lepera the\nholistic psychologist here so today's\nvideo is on a topic that I get a lot of\nquestions about ego and ego work so\nfirst I'm going to take us through what\nthe ego is what ego work is and how to\nget started so first and foremost this\nego we each have one what is it it's a\npart of our self-identity that has been\ninternalized based on our very real\nlived experiences for most of us this\nbegins in childhood so I'm going to use\nan example to illustrate say as a little\nchild we find something that just lights\nus up we're so interested in it\ndifferent for each of us some of us it\nmight be art some of us Sports dancing\nwhatever\nwe are having we find that thing and we\nhave the experience of you know we're\nglowing we're excited and we're in the\npresence of one of our caregivers and if\nthat caregiver responds maybe they don't\nrespond at all maybe they just kind of\nignore us and our excitement or maybe as\nwe approach and try to show them how\nexcited we are they're a little bit\ndetached they're not there maybe they\neven respond negatively negative could\neven mean don't get too excited calm\ndown don't yell Dad's sleeping or we\ndon't we're not interested in that\nthat's not who we are as a family and\nI'm just throwing out many examples\nas a little child that hurts that causes\na pain that doesn't feel like we're\naccepted and that our interests are\naccepted in that moment\nso what do we do we are incredibly\nadaptive\nso we learn meaning Chances Are Over\ntime we're going to show interest in\nthat particular thing or similar things\nless and less to avoid that same hurt\nthat's what we call as a shadow doesn't\nmean that that art or that dance or that\nmusic or whatever it is isn't still part\nof who we are or our interest in that of\ncourse it is it just means that we learn\nnot to show up in the world because what\nwe've registered is we don't get love in\nthe way that we want love if we show up\nin the world with that\nthis could happen on the opposite end\ntoo where because we're so attuned and\nadaptive as children we learn the\npositive ways that we get unconditional\nlove or acceptance or what we feel to be\nunconditional love and we learn how to\nshow up as that so for me\nthat became\nachievement School athletic I learned\nthat that's how I got the reception from\nmy parents the accolades and the\nvalidation ultimately the love\nprobably why I went to school for so\ngoddamn long and got a PhD but I do love\nthe topic and I love the work I'm doing\nbut just an example so that's how we\ncarry that into adulthood I became a\nhuman who really looked to seek\nvalidation in myself\nfrom achieving so as part of my healing\njourney I had to learn to get validation\nin other ways something I want you to\nunderstand as I'm going into what ego\nthen work is\nis our ego is protecting us it is not\nsomething that we want to get rid of or\nkill or probably not even something that\nwill ultimately go away it's there for a\nreason and it becomes activated in\nmoments to protect us to keep us safe\nso what does ego work then ego work is\nreally a practice that takes time but\nit's a practice of beginning to observe\nthe ego as separate from the authentic\nself to be able to separate who I really\nam so the authentic me that contains all\nthe positive things and all the things\nthat I came to believe were a shadow of\nmyself\ncoming to accept it all and to\nunderstand that the ego is there to\nprotect me so how do we begin\nI love the practice of naming the ego\nthe act of naming it so my ego's name\nhappens to be Tiffany so when I sense\nthat Tiffany has been activated in my\ncurrent life in any way being able to\nlabel it in my mind oh there's Tiffany\nagain she's hurt she doesn't feel\naccepted she's wanting love whatever it\nis that she's nagging about in that\nmoment giving her a name that's separate\nfrom me it's not Nicole helps me to\nunderstand that oh that's just separate\nfrom me that Nicole is actually the\nperson that I can cultivate the\nopportunity to make a new choice so once\nI've named my ego and I can get used to\nidentifying my ego and her responses in\nmy life\nI can begin to dive a bit deeper\nand I can ask myself\nmy ego is telling me a story that we\nreally want to explore the the story\nthat my ego is telling us so I'm going\nto shift away from me and throughout a\nreally Global example that I think will\nresonate for with a lot of you which is\na lot of our egos tend to tell us\nstories that our thoughts our ideas our\nwork isn't good enough right\nso once I've Dove down and I understand\noh this is my ego maybe she's critical\nIn This Moment Tiffany's telling me all\nthe ways I'm not good enough I can label\nthat as Tiffany trying to protect me\nright and understand that that's where\nthat's coming from the story if I were\nto believe the story right that my\nthoughts my ideas my work isn't good\nenough how would I react a couple ways\nam I procrastinate I might not show up\nat all I might compare myself to a\nmillion other people obviously not\ncomparing myself up comparing myself\ndown I'm less than them further evidence\nthat I'm not good enough or not worthy\nin that way those are not helpful\nreactions to fulfill us maybe in the\nways that we want to be fulfilled over\ntime if I release that story right if I\ncan release the story of my thoughts my\nideas my work not being good enough I\ncan make space for a new choice\nchoice not to procrastinate a choice to\nput my truth out into the world a choice\nto stop comparing myself endlessly to\nothers and a choice to allow the\nauthentic me my light and my dark and\neverything in between to show up in this\nworld so before I end\nis a long time process this does not\nhappen overnight\nbut the more we come to the\nunderstanding of how our ego still\nfunctions in our life because it does\nthe more we understand that it's\nprotecting us our goal isn't to kill it\nor fight it away it's not an intrusive\nthing that's happening to us it's\nsomething that we can learn to work with\nto separate from and to be make new\nchoices so that we can show up more\nauthentically in the world I hope you\nfound this helpful I did write a blog on\nall things ego work as well that covers\nthese so for those of you who like\nsomething in the written form I will\nlink that down below so you can check\nthat out as well"
