    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola Peres the\nholistic psychologist here today's video\nis on the most important nerve in our\nhuman bodies that is called the vagus\nnerve we're gonna talk a little bit\nabout what it is why it's important and\nthen some practices to develop what we\ncall tone to tone our vagus nerve so\nfirst and foremost what is it is a\nbundle of nerves that goes originates in\nour brainstem and goes all the way down\nand nerve aiding or connecting all of\nour major organs so our heart or\ndigestive tract etc it powers up our\nbody's involuntary or unconscious bodily\nfunctions meaning it happens outside of\nour awareness these nervous the nervous\nsystem or our nervous systems are\nactivated through this nerve even when\nwe're not attending to something in\nparticular we all we have a sixth sense\nas we call it that's feeling our\nenvironment particularly looking for\nstress so this brings me into what is\nmost why it's important why I'm talking\nabout it the reality of it is that most\nof us these days\nare living just in a stressful\nenvironment humans were we are\nevolutionarily geared to be living on\nthe tundra on the plains and a very calm\nexperience in one with nature\nso first and foremost if you live in a\ncity like myself the simple environment\nthe external environment that many of us\nare living in it's stressful to our\nnervous system those of us who have\nexperienced any form of trauma the big\ncataclysmic big key of trauma or the\nsmall T of trauma also can develop what\nwe call hyperactive fight-or-flight or\nrelieve it living in sympathetic\noverdrive or always activate it we're\nhyper vigilant we're hyper aroused all\nthe time back on those planes the the\nway our stress response is geared or is\nis a wired we need to be able to\ntolerate stress right threat comes the\nanimal comes my resources are\nsummoned I fight or flee whatever is\nnecessary in that given moment and then\nI have time I go back to my Hut and I\ncome back down into that parasympathetic\nstate so we are geared as humans to be\nable to tolerate stress the problem\nbecomes and when that stress is\nconsistent when it over works our\nnervous system when we're always maybe\nin that hyper aroused State so I know I\nlived in this for the better part of\nthree decades until I began my healing\njourney my whole body was in that\nsympathetic overdrive and the reason why\nI bring this up is because cognitive\nthinking our way logic in our way\nthrough those emotions as impossible so\nthese trauma responses really do live in\nour body which is why we need to\npractice vagal tone so if you're\nrelating and you feel like you're always\non edge or you're always stress or\nyou're always hyper vigilant or you have\nsuffered traumas in your past it's\nlikely that you're caught in that\nsympathetic response so what we're\ntrying to do with these six exercises is\nto develop what we call tone to activate\nthe opposing nervous system that\nparasympathetic so that over time we can\nlearn how to activate appropriately for\nstress and then deactivate to give our\nbody that restive much-needed healing\nstate so here are six daily practices\nthat you can build in I started with\ngargling most of us have availability to\ngargle when we're brushing our teeth go\nto the sink gargling and literally\nmanually stimulates the tip of your\nvagus nerve singing chanting for all of\nthe singers or the musicians or artists\nout there maybe just sing in your shower\nany version of loud singing or loud\nchanting oh whatever it might be again\nsimilarly manually activates the tip of\nthat vagus nerve I like this one\nlaughter cultivating laughter having\njust laughed or present somewhere in\nyour life you are similarly activating\nor toning that vagus nerve Yoga anyone\nwho practices yoga this could be even\nsimple stretching maybe you're not in a\nyoga class I do yoga at home all the\ntime\nYoga is very much a stimulator of that\nvagus nerve breathing those of you\nfollow me no I'm always going on and on\nabout breath work conscious breathing\nthe breath we're looking for is from our\ndeep belly space I have a video that\nI'll link below that you can check out\nthe deep belly breathing will activate\nour vagus nerve and so on any form of\nmovement it doesn't have to be strenuous\ndon't have to be miles or hid can just\nbe walking moving the body\nall of these are activities the more\nconsistently you practice them you are\nmanually activating that parasympathetic\nthat restive response so that what we're\ntrying to cultivate over time is a\nresilience is the body's ability we're\ntrying to retrain what was once us being\nstuck in over activation we're trying to\nretrain ourselves and our body's\nprocesses back to that state of I stress\nand I activate and I take care of what\nneeds to be taken care of and then I\ndeactivate so we're trying to develop\nrecovery post stress many of us are not\ngiving our bodies the chance to enter\ninto that recovery mode so as always one\nsmall daily problem is pick one of these\nareas and make that your small daily\npromise and then just build on it you'll\nbe giving your body that resilience that\nrecovery from stress and from trauma\nthat is so desperately needed to heal"
