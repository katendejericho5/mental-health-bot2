    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Niccole a pair of the\nholistic psychologists here so today's\nvideo I'm going to dive a bit deeper\ninto insecure avoidant attachment and\nhow to heal it last video that I will\nlink below I overview four different\nattachment styles so you might want to\njump back on and check that out to see\nif this is the one that you relate to so\nwhat is it what it is really is based on\nour earliest experiences with\nrelationships we learn an overall\npattern of detaching from our bodies\nfrom our sensations from our emotions\nand we then tend to engage in a habit of\nminimizing our emotions in adulthood\nwhat that ends up looking like is one of\ntwo things we either avoid the emotional\nintimacy of relationships altogether or\nif we find ourselves in emotional\nrelationships we tend to have a one foot\nin one foot out or waiting for the next\nshoe to drop\ntype of mentality about it so if you\nrelate to this three steps to begin to\nheal into a more secure attachment\npattern the first step is really\nbecoming aware of and questioning our\nstories a lot of time we're talking to\nourselves and we're telling our self\nthings and our relationships such as oh\nthis won't last or you know a delay and\ncontact this oh they were leaving anyway\nso again watch the mental narrative that\nwe're spinning in our minds a lot of\ntimes or strengthening something that is\nmore based on our past experience and\nnot really in the present reality which\nbrings me to number two a lot of times\nthat detachment leads to us having a\nreally hard time and us need to practice\nconsciousness or grounding ourselves in\nthe present moment a great practice is\nbreath work through practicing conscious\nbreathing and really in connecting with\nyourself and your body and the act of\nbreathing will help ground you in your\nbody which also body awareness grounding\nfeeling your feet on the ground this\nwill help to break that habit of\ndetaching and really starting to learn\nwhat it feels like to be in your body\nand how you you inhabit the space the\nsensations that go along with emotions\nbecause that's the reality emotion\nour sensations in our body and when we\npractice a habit of detaching from that\nwe really lose that valuable information\nso a big part of the healing journey and\nI know this from my own personal\nexperience because I had a big a\nlong-standing pattern I should say of\ndissociation or attachment from my body\nso really learning how it felt emotion\nsensations in my body was a big part of\nmy healing journey bringing me to three\nonce we learned that our bodies are\nassociated with sensations learning how\nto talk about them not in terms of what\nhappened to caused them but how to talk\nabout just what they feel like I feel\ntightness I feel tingling I feel heat\nthose of us who feel comfortable enough\nsharing that in relationships whether\nit's our friends or our family or our\npartners another really helpful step is\nto then learn how to share just based on\nthis those sensations not based on what\ncaused it but sharing with your partner\nwith your friend you know I'm feeling\ntight I'm feeling tense right now\nand learning just how to communicate\nabout the very real experience that we\nall have in our bodies when emotions\nhappen so those of you who haven't\nsecured avoidant attachment patterns I\nhope you find these three steps helpful\nand beginning to heal"
