    "transcript": "hi everyone dr. Nicola peridot holistic\npsychologist here as always thank you\nguys for tuning in all of my subscribers\nthey thank you those of you who are not\nyet subscribed if you like this video do\nso at the end so today I'm going to talk\na little bit about the difference\nbetween productive and unproductive\nthoughts and give you guys some\nexploratory questions to begin to make\nthat differentiation on your own so the\nreality of it is everyone out there\nlistening is having thoughts all day\nlong anyone who knows my work or who has\never worked with me knows that I go on\nand on about the benefits of mindfulness\nbased meditation practice because the\nmore we practice observing our internal\nworld during a sitting meditation the\nkind that we always think of when we\ntraditionally think of meditating the\nmore we're going to be able to do that\nin daily life so that we can see if you\nwill the thoughts that we're having and\nthen building in a step when we based on\nwhat we see where we can start to\ndetermine whether or not the thought\nthat we're having is helpful or\nproductive or unhelpful because the\nreality of it is we as humans spend an\nincredible amount of time and thought\nand that's amazing I mean we have\nthought we are gifted with it we are the\nincredible humans that we are because of\nit but there's a lot of ways where we\nenter into an unproductive use of this\nthought so the difference is I actually\nso those of you listening who don't know\nyet about meditation you can check out a\nbeginner's guide to meditation video\nthat I did a few weeks ago that I won't\nlink below so get started on the\npractice so that then we can observe her\nthoughts all day long and start to\ndetermine whether\nhaving productive thoughts or those\nunproductive thoughts so productive\nthought first incredibly productive way\nthat we can use our thought is to solve\nproblems so as we think about\ndifficulties on their life or issues or\nhurdles or roadblocks whatever it is we\ncan use our thought to find solutions to\nthose problems\nhowever we start to go into the\nunproductive comment column when those\nsolutions become repetitive so if we're\nthinking about an issue that we have and\nwe've mapped out for ourself and a very\nproductive way say two or three ways\nthat we can solve the problem the more\nwe think about it we might start to find\nthat those solutions just keep coming up\nrepetitively we still come down that\nsame one to three options once we've\nexhausted the productivity as in once we\nno longer have a new solution coming to\nmind chances are we're engaging in that\nmore repetitive what I would call\nunproductive way of problem-solving the\nsecond one our thought is incredibly\nhelpful to gain insight so if we're\nrevisiting say our day and an issue that\nwe had or even ourselves over our life\nor past our history we can explore it in\na way that allows us to gain insight\nunderstanding awareness that as I always\nsay is the first step to changing things\nhowever sometimes when we revisit our\npast there are self in this way we fall\ninto what we call rumination which is\nwhere we just become excessive in our\nrevisiting of our day or issue that\nfight with our partner again in a\nsimilar way that we no longer we've\nexhausted the insight or the aha oh okay\nnext time this happen\nI will do X once we've saturated and we\ncannot come up with the new insight we\nare probably entering into that category\nof rumination that is not helpful that\ncan just keep us stuck in our issues\nanother productive use of thought is\nplanning thinking about the future and\nbeing able to you know reverse engineer\nas they say the steps to get there is\nincredibly helpful to getting there\nhowever a lot of us engage in\nunproductive future based thought one of\nwhich is predictive when we attempt to\npredict a future that unfortunately is\ncompletely unpredictable I know that's a\nreally hard reality for many of us\nhumans to settle into but we cannot\npredict our future none of us can if any\nof you out there have met the predictor\nof the future I would love to but we're\njust not good at that so if we're using\nour future based thought and we've\nalready mapped out maybe the plan to get\nthere and if we're trying to predict\nwhat's gonna happen next chances are\nwe're using our thought I'm putting\nunproductively another type of\nunproductive future based thinking is\nworst-case scenario thinking now I know\na lot of you I know I see this all the\ntime similar similar mindset I'm\nthinking about the future at all I find\nmyself doing is thinking about the\nworst-case worst-case scenario again now\nI've moved from moved from the helpful\naspect of planning to something that's\nincredibly unhelpful\nanother way that we unproductively think\nabout the future is an intense to\ncontrol it similar type of thing if I\nthink about the future long enough I get\na false sense of security that I can\ncontrol that future that like I just\nsaid is largely uncontrollable for all\nof us another so back to productive\nthoughts a another way I can use thought\nin a productive way is to create to\ncreate whether I'm an art if I do art or\nanything that's you know put a creative\naspect in my life that's it\neasy productive way to see you saw\nhowever we start to go into that\nunproductive category when we have\nracing thoughts the similar thought over\nand over and over again a lot of times\nthis is called monkey mind the\nengagement in that racing or monkey mind\nbased thought actually is a killer of\nall creativity so those of you out there\nwho are now practicing what I call that\ndaily self observation you're watching\nyour thoughts throughout the day to help\nyou determine whether or not your\nthought is falling into the productive\nor the unproductive category here are\nfour exploratory questions that you can\nbegin to ask yourself first and foremost\nare these thoughts helping me create new\nsolutions so like I said earlier once\nyou've exhausted the solutions and\nnothing else new is coming up chances\nare you're entering into that\nunproductive column do these thoughts\nchange an outcome again the more I think\nabout something am I going to affect\nchange in that area likely the answer\nalways is going to be enough especially\nif it's a future based outcome are these\nthoughts affirming and negative a belief\nabout myself a lot of us are affirming\nnegative beliefs about ourself all day\nlong\nI'm going to go out there and say\nuniversally none of those thoughts are\never productive and then can I do\nsomething about the thoughts now that's\nthe pivotal question so if I'm thinking\nagain about a future based issue and or\nanything that's happening in my life if\nI'm sitting on my couch and the event\ndoesn't happen till tomorrow\nonce I've exhausted the planning stage\nin a helpful way chances are I'm\nentering into that product unproductive\ncolumn because the thing isn't going to\nhappen until tomorrow so now me\nobsessively thinking it about it it's\nonly going to stress me out and probably\nmake tomorrow worse so I hope this was\nhelpful to get some of you out there\nthinking and building in this habit once\nwe start to observe our thoughts\nasking yourself these exploratory\nquestions and if and when we determined\nour thoughts are unproductive\ngreat time to use the mindfulness muscle\nthat I'm always going on and on about\nwhich is removing our attention from\nthose thoughts back to our breath back\nto whatever is actually happening in our\ncurrent moment anywhere but those\nthoughts again remember this is a\npractice this does not come overnight\nbut as an incredibly valuable practice\nbecause a lot of us a spend too much\ntime thinking and our be doing so in an\nunproductive way and causing yourself"
