    "transcript": "all right guy so you asked for it this\nvideo is on emotional measurement first\nwe're going to go over what it is and\nthen some questions to ask to see if\nmaybe you are struggling with emotional\nor measurement yourself and then as\nalways some quick how-to heel tips so\nemotional measurement when a family\nrelationship or a relationship itself\nhas too much love I wrote that for a\nreason because I think a lot of times\nyou get confused because we think caring\nabout another person is a loving\nconsiderate thing to do and while that\nis the case absolutely I consider myself\na considered human being and I care\nabout others there's a limit and there\nis a area where the boundaries between\nmy emotions and someone else gets a bit\ntoo bored and it really does have some\nnegative consequences so emotional\nmeasurement essentially what this is is\nwhen the emotions of one person in a\nrelationship or in a family unit affect\nthe whole emotional climate of everyone\nelse so you know if mom is having a bad\nday before you know what the whole\nfamily is bearing the emotion of mom's\nbad day this could happen into personal\nrelationships as well where the partner\ncomes home and is having a stressful\ntime at work before you know it the\nother partner is starting to whether\nthose same emotions another sign of\nemotional measurement is sometimes when\nthere's no privacy when everything is\naired every small emotional event of one\nperson again into personal relationship\nor in a family dynamic is talked about\nvery openly and\nsometimes really does connect that first\npiece to where now we're all feeling\nabout that one event because all\nemotions are really aired for everyone\npublicly another sign essentially of\nemotional measurement is the tendency\nthen and these are all really\ninterconnected to begin to look out of\nour outside of ourselves for validation\nfor decisions so again this looks like\nin a two personal relationship always\nchecking in with our partner or again in\na family always balancing decisions as\nsmall as where should I go or what you\neat for dinner\nto as big as what are my career\ndirections in life and the same thing\nchecking in with everyone to get that\nvalidation so that I can feel secure\nthat I'm making the right decision so if\nyou guys are listening and you're\nquestioning you know am i struggling\nwith this or maybe some of that sound\nthat's similar these are six really\nquick great questions to begin to ask\nyourself so the first one do you feel\nresponsible for the emotions or needs\nof someone else so am i finding that I'm\ncompensating or really trying so hard to\nmake everyone or someone else around me\nfeel better do you feel that you can\nrescue or fix those around you and then\nvice versa do you feel that you're\nwaiting for those around you to rescue\nor fix you and again I want to just keep\npointing out there's a limit between I'm\nconsiderate and you know when someone\nthat I love is struggling I'll be there\nfor a supportive ear but those who hear\nme talk a lot I know that there's a\nlimit of how much I can control and\nfalling into this role of rescuer helper\ncaretaker things that I hear come up so\noften in the clients that I work with\nthat is a bit on the extreme the reality\nof it is and you know this is really\nhard for many of us we cannot rescue or\nfix anyone else and we cannot wait for\nanyone else to rescue or fix us\nquestions right do you find yourself\noffended or fearful when someone needs\nemotional space and I have lived this\nexperience as long as I can remember\nanytime any of my partner's needed we\nhad an argument they need to take some\nspace we all process our emotions\ndifferently I automatically took that to\nmean the relationship must be over this\nis a very bad thing to happen again so\nthat's a really really good marker space\nfor other people\nto process their emotions is completely\nnormal\nso if you find yourself starting to have\na panic reaction when other people are\ntaking space that might be a marker of\nthose those two blurred emotional\nboundaries number four do you know hurt\nyour own emotional needs do you know how\nto go about meeting them sounds so\nsimple again I did not know how I did\nnot know what my emotions are I did not\nknow how this might sound crazy coming\nfrom a psychologist I did not know how\nto give them words let alone I did not\neven know how to start to begin to meet\nmy own emotional needs so if you guys\nfeel the same this might be a sign that\nyou too have struggled with emotion\nhuh do you struggle with boundaries on\nthe biggest hot topics around or\nboundaries similarly if you find\nyourself having a hard time putting\nlimits up it's all a boundary is limits\nin relationships if you're struggling to\ndefine it was again not connects to\nnumber four if you're struggling to put\nthem up to enact them as I say or to\nmaintain them the feel bags on the other\nside of boundaries chances are you\nstruggled yourself with some version of\nemotional mesh matter number six do you\nfeel addicted to relationships what I\nmean by that is do you feel yourself on\nthe ride again the emotional ride of\nsomeone else same thing if my partner is\nhaving a good day good week a good year\nI'm having a good day a good week a good\nyear if they're not I'm not as well so\nare you want someone else's emotional\nrollercoaster if you are if you find\nyourself commonly on someone else's\nemotional rollercoaster chances are your\nemotional boundaries are a bit blurred\nso now what I know a lot of you are\nprobably thinking ooh I can relate to\nsome of these so three quick tips first\none simple alone time this just means\nseparate time and space I'm gonna go out\nI'm gonna plan a lunch of coffee a walk\naround the block anytime that I can\ncarve out just some time to be by myself\nfor the introverts out there that could\nmean journaling just some time where I'm\njust mean that can be a really really\ngreat start evolving that bit where are\nmy interest\nwhere are my hobbies now I'm starting to\nget a little more deeply connected with\nmyself talk about this often because I\nused to talk with my partner about this\nI didn't have hobbies that I knew if I\ndidn't have interests when I first met\nher and I did not I thought maybe it was\njust something I just was someone who\ndidn't know or I wasn't the person who\ngot gifted with hobbies or interests I\nassure you we all have hobbies and\ninterests so for some of us it's just\nreconnecting what were those things\nyou'd like to do in childhood pick those\nup for me it was art I started to paint\nagain I started to just define something\nthat I liked on my own my partner\ndoesn't like to paint and that's okay I\nwas able to have something that was a\nlittle bit deeper that was just for me\nand then the infamous bouncer he said so\nreally if you're struggling with\nemotional investment chances are that in\nyour relationships you're probably\nhaving a hard time defining boundaries\nenacting boundaries and maintaining\nboundaries those are the three steps of\nboundaries I have another youtube video\nthat I will link below that you can\ncheck out but that they're hard I'm\ngoing to just tell you right now\nboundaries are hard but for those of us\nwho have emotional measurement they're\nso integral they give us a bit of space\nto start to carve out our own emotional\nworld separate from those around us so I\nhope this video was helpful I definitely\nam the poster child of emotional\nmeasurement so I share this in such a\nrelatable way this part of my journey\nwas so integral I hope you guys found\nthis helpful and thanks for listening"
