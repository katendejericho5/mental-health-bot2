    "transcript": "so this video is on how to create a new\nhabit so first and foremost why they\nwant to create new habits new habits are\nour way out of our subconscious programs\nare our way out of the things that we do\nmindlessly on autopilot without thinking\nabout it day after death so five steps\nto create a new habit we want to first\npick a a small change something so small\nit's barely even noticeable so some\nexamples of this could be getting up 10\nminutes earlier starting a meditation\npractice for two or three minutes five\ndeep belly breaths I work with clients\nall the time the smallness of this the\ninsignificance almost almost barely\nnoticeable is so important because\nclients I work with want to do all of\nthese new things some of you guys watch\nme every morning doing multiple things I\nget up by journal I work out you know I\nmeditate I do breath work I did not\nstart doing all of these things at once\nthe reason for this is that we want to\nwork with our subconscious not against\nit what do I mean when I say that if you\nguys listen to my last video which I'm\ngoing to link below on mental resistance\nmental resistance is there our\nsubconscious is going to try to talk us\nout of doing these new things the whole\ntime we're doing these new things so\nwhat is important like I said it's\npicking a habit that's so small a new\nbehavior that's so small because not\nonly does it make it likelier that we're\ngoing to be able to keep that promise\nthat new small promise to ourselves for\nat least 30 days remember consistency is\nor in but it also is going to give us\npractice overcoming our mental\nresistance because each time so say if\nit's I'm gonna wake up ten minutes\nearlier each time my alarm goes off ten\nminutes earlier better believe my mental\nresistance is going to say oh no you\nhave 10 more minutes go back to sleep so\neach time I make a new choice I'm\novercoming that mental resistance so one\nsmall habit one small thing we build a\nfoundation we empower ourselves to start\nto make these new choices and then over\ntime we can start to add new behaviors\nbut start with one step to set an\nintention what does that mean that means\nI'm going to consciously now remember we\nthe subconscious which is my autopilot\nso I'm going to consciously remind\nmyself I want to do this new thing and\nI'm gonna remind myself all day until\nI've done the thing and then I'm gonna\nremind myself that I want to do the\nthing the next day it's as simple as\nthat that's important because a reminder\na conscious intention is activating\nconsciousness it's activating the\nawareness that has the choice in that\nmoment to say you know what now I'm not\ngonna stay about 10 more minutes I'm\ngonna get up so the more we consistently\nremind that consciousness the more\nlikely we are to make that choice number\nthree do it no matter what each time you\ndo it like I said you are empowering\nyourself the language I use if you guys\nfollow me on Instagram is you're keeping\na small promise to yourself\nso doing it no matter what is so\nempowering activating that choice is so\nempowering what's not empowering is not\ndoing it and then watching yourself and\nhave all of that inner critic and all of\nthat shame that's going to make you feel\nhopeless helpless and disempowered so it\nis so important especially at the\nbeginning stages of habit creation to do\nit to X\nsighs that choice no matter what and\nthen the final step this is building\ntoward empowerment I want you to do\nthree things I want you to notice that\nyou've done it so once I went and I did\nthat two minute meditation or I got up\nten minutes earlier don't go right back\ninto autopilot with a million other\nthings that I have to do in my day\nconsciously notice you know what Nichole\nyou did that thing it's as simple as\nthat\nagain we're activating consciousness\nwe're logging to ourselves that we kept\nthat promise that we set an intention\nand we did what we said and then I want\nyou after it to resist any urge to feed\nthat inner critic to minimize it to\ninvalidate it to say ah it was only two\nminutes today that was nothing or to\nhyper focus on the reality and you might\nnot feel the effects of it right away\ntwo-minute meditation you might feel\ngood after it you might not and that's\nokay\nbecause what's important remember is\nthat we're breaking we're creating a\nhabit we're breaking out of the\nsubconscious so do not dis empower\nyourself once you've done it by\nminimizing or invalidating or almost\nmaking as if you shouldn't have done it\nso resist that urge and then the final\none I want you to start to observe the\nchanges as they accumulate over time I\nsay over time because a lot of these\nchanges like I said aren't going to\nhappen right away we are shifting from\nimmediate feedback I feel good right now\nwhich is usually what drives a lot of\nour negative habits - one that is more\nlong-term so I might have to meditate or\nwake up earlier for 10 minutes for a\nmonth and then I might start to feel a\nlittle different the more we notice that\nnot only are we empowered because I made\nthe choice that got me now this new\nchange these effects is positive but we\nalso now\nhave the evidence that's going to be in\nour consciousness that we can factor in\nthe next million times our brain tells\nus not to so for me again my mental\nchatter said to me the time I wake up it\ntells me not together tells me not to\nmeditate tells me that Jim I can go to\ntomorrow or I can do one last set tells\nme a million things but I make the\nchoices do it anyway why because I've\nobserved now over time how I feel when I\ndo these things each day consistently\nand how I feel when I don't so in that\nspace now between hearing my mental\nvoice my chatter my resistance which is\nalways there I can remind myself no you\nknow what Nicole you don't want to do it\ntoday I don't want to do it any day and\nyour thoughts have made a great case\nwith why I shouldn't do it or I don't\nhave to do it today but I'm choosing to\nand I'm choosing to like I said because\nI've noticed the difference that will\nkeep you motivated so I hope you find\nthese steps helpful remember change is\nhard creating new habits is hard but is\nthe way out of our subconscious\nprogramming and the more we practice\nthis not only do we have some great new\nhabits which can have really amazing\neffects in our lives but we can start to\nfeel empowered and the more empowered we\nare and the more we trust ourselves and\nthe more we watch ourselves keeping our\nword then we can truly create anything\nin our lives so I hope you guys found\nthis video helpful thank you for tuning\nin"
