    "transcript": "I hello everyone dr. Nicola Pyrrha the\nholistic psychologist Here I am actually\nchatting with someone I'm really excited\nto have a conversation with her name is\nSuzy Parker she has been in the\ncommunity for some time now and her\ncomments kept catching my eye and I\njourneyed over to her Instagram page and\nmy mind was blown at the wealth of\nhealing knowledge that she is putting\nout there to the world that she is\nliving' herself so I wanted to grab Suzy\nand have her on for a conversation done\nsome incredible healing around ADHD so I\nknow a lot of our listeners out there a\nlot of our community struggles whether\nor not you carry the official diagnosis\nof ADHD or not I definitely hear about\nattentional struggles pretty prolific\nLee so I want to have Susie jump on and\nwe can dive in right there and thank you\nSusie for having a chat with us thank\nyou for having me such an honor\nseriously thank you so much incredible I\nmean you've been such a supportive\nmember of the community so yeah so I\nguess locate us in time get us give us a\nlittle bit of an idea of where your\nstart point was on this journey of\nhealing for all the attentional stuff\nthat I know could be really really\ndifficult I know it was for you and I\nknow is that it is really pervasive for\na lot of us in that community yeah so\nhow I started was um my daughter who is\ncoming up 12 was diagnosed with ADHD\nwhen she's six she was also diagnosed\nwith 80 with anxiety and a positional\ndefiance disorder so she had quite a few\nthings going on couldn't miss a\nsix-year-old and it was during this time\nthat I like any mom you have a diagnosis\nand I just started to read read books we\nblogs just everything just do all my\nresearch and what I started to realize a\ncall is that it made sense it's like my\nwhole life was there in front of me that\nsuddenly I realized oh my goodness I\nthink I'm the one that's actually had\nADHD and it's never been diagnosed I\nstarted to think about you know my\nchildhood growing up all the different\ncareers that have had the different\nmoods and it just started to make sense\nthat this is actually something from me\noh my goodness um\nso that was a big part of it I think it\nrealizing that you know my daughter\nobviously comes from me the the way I'd\nbeen I think that we diagnose these kids\nbut what I wanted to do is just kind of\nreally look at myself and I realized\nthat I'd always been you know doing\neverything at 100 miles an hour living\nmy life 400 miles an hour just running\nrunning running running even everything\nI do the way I talk the way I move very\nanimated and she was a little version of\nme that I really saw that link between\nmother and child\num incredible incredible I think I love\nthat you are acknowledging that too\nbecause I think it's hard I mean whether\nor not you're acknowledging I'm not a\nmother so I cannot really but I can\nspeak from just my own personal healing\nacknowledging ourselves and the role\nthat we play in life is an incredibly\ndifficult difficult radical honesty that\nwe are providing for our healing journey\nif we're not honest and we can't see the\nroller plane so I say that to say I\ncan't imagine like I said I do not have\na child but I have the idea that it's\nreally hot it probably was a pretty\npainful truth to really take a hard look\nand say okay maybe these are some\nbehaviors that I also have seen in\nmyself and now I see them extending so\nagain not to speak for you but I just\nwant to commend that honesty because\nlike I said along my own journey I had\nso many moments where telling myself my\nown truth about me and the role that I\nwas playing in my current world was hard\nit was painful in addition to the\nrealizations that I was having just\nhaving to own that was uncomfortable so\nyou know it's so right and the thing is\nI always remember the psychologist\nsaying to me I just want you to know\nthis is nothing that you've done you\nknow you haven't caused this it's not\nthe way that you've parented your child\nit's nothing that you've done and I can\nunderstand why she said that but at the\nsame time what I started to realize is\nfor me personally it was my fault\nwe'd raised her she was always a very ro\nspirited challenging child from like the\nage of one when she could walk she just\nliteral races you're not kidding so I'm\nso\nraised her in the only way that we knew\nwhich was through control that's how\nI've been parented all the books we were\nreading you know about naughty step and\ntimeout\nwe just dived into all of that to think\nthis is going to be the thing that would\nhelp her and what I learned is that the\nway that we had parented it both myself\nand my husband and probably everybody\naround her grandparents\nyou know auntie's oh because we were all\ndoing a very similar thing is that what\nI started to realize is she'd almost\nfeel of this defense this wall to\nprotect herself and that wall is what we\ncall oppositional defiance disorder when\nI look at it now I think that's all she\nknows\nso the shouting screaming you know\nthat's all she could do to just kind of\nlike protect herself just to try and\ncontrol her her world in some way um you\nknow she was a vet at age six that she\nwas so unruly that it was kind of like\ncrazy really but we parented her through\ncontrol which is the advice we were\ngiven from the expert the worst behavior\ngot and it was a it was it was a tough\npill to swallow to say you know what I\nknow all the books pretty much the books\ndid you read about ADHD you know there's\noffice what a lot of beautiful books are\nthere that I've since read about\nconscious parenting I wish I read back\nthen but I was I was going for all the\nADHD runs and the oppositional defiance\ndisorder and all of them a lot of them\nthe ones that I read work was still you\nknow to show them who's boss give them a\nyou know tighter leash if you like and\njust control control and obviously\nthat's how the school is so it was broad\nyou get sent out you don't do as you're\ntold you get sent unto the headmistress\noffice and it was all to do with control\nand um yes so do going back a little bit\nwe just moved to Australia so we had a\nthree four month old babies when she was\ndiagnosed with a four month old baby a\ntwo-year-old and a really spirited cific\nshe had this idea to just emigrate sort\nearlier leave all our family or friends\nbe like really cool why not why not\nright\nand I think I realized when we when we\ngot here that I actually wasn't that\ncool and I didn't need my you know only\nI'm sure I'm sure I want to go back to\ntwo things you said Susie cuz I think\nthey were so impactful before we shift\ninto the next part of this because you\nacknowledge two things right you\nacknowledge that we were parenting and I\nthink a lot of parents are going to\nrelate to this right based not by none\nof this let me simplify this it wasn't\nintentional\nright you were doing things that you\nwere believing to be helpful for for a\nchild because there's so many messages\nout there and some of which we come to\nthe conclusions also based on our past\nexperience doing one of two things okay\nthese things work for me when I was a\nkid or these things definitely didn't\nwork for me I'm I'm really simplifying\nI'm gonna do the complete opposite of\nthe things that didn't work that my\nparents did and then we've all of these\nsocietal message that come in and then\nwe parent you know we don't have the\nmanual for this we figure our way and I\nsay all about to say that I think a lot\nof humans out there you know are not\nintentionally whether we're they out the\nadult human looking back on our own\nchildhood experiences or were the adult\ntrying to navigate having our own\nchildren you know we are making choices\nsometimes that are not even fully ours\nmeaning that we become very habitual and\nlike I said we have these beliefs and\nthen we operate on these beliefs so none\nof the parenting that we're doing is or\na lot of the parenting that we're doing\nit's not even intentional meaning we're\nnot conscious in the moments to make\nchoices we're operating on beliefs that\nlike I say were of the best of our\nattention intentions working with the\ninformation that we had at the time and\nthen we continue to just utilize those\nof course they don't always work you\nknow as effectively and we don't always\nhave that advantage point to understand\nand you said something else that's\nreally important to which is viewing\nyour daughter's behaviors as an\nadaptation I think that's so beautiful\nand that was so intuitive that you came\nto that realization that insight on your\nown and that's incredible because I am\nthe biggest believer in that we all\ncarry what were once adaptation so\nyou're your daughter's wall of defiance\nif you will was her best attempt\nat keeping her safe I'm using really\nsimplified words but some version of\nprotecting from whatever was happening\nor whatever reaction internally that her\nenvironment was triggering me in are so\nshe made herself safe and that's\noutwardly then would it look like and\nthen if you deposit her into your family\nand into the school system where there's\nparameters in place external rules where\nthose defenses don't fit or mesh now\nit's so unfortunate you have a child\nthat's being condemned or punished for a\nreally helpful adaptation and I think\nthat's so intuitive and beautiful that\nyou're able to acknowledge that and I\nsuggest parents out there if they see\nbehaviors in their children may be to\nexplore just like we do for ourselves\nand our own healing what might be\ndriving this is there something deeper\ngoing on this this thing that my child\ndoes habitually time and time again in\nthis very similar context does that\ncarry a deeper meaning is my child\noperating in protection of themselves\nand that's gonna give you I think a\nbigger a bigger clarity or a greater\nclarity as to how to really help the\nchild it's a really incredibly beautiful\nthat you were able to exclude of Lea\npick up on that and acknowledge the\nfunction of those behaviors for her hmm\nand I think it came as a realization for\nme and then it was really confirmed by\nserán years later got probably only 18\nmonths ago we were lying in bed one\nnight we were just talking and she just\nstarted twitch isn't up to talk about\nthe past but occasionally she will and\nshe articulated it really well and she\nsaid you know I remember there was some\ninstances that happen in our family when\nyou know real poignant moments of her\nbehavior when we felt really lost and\nquite scared of the future be honest I'm\nsure you were what things were you\nscared of it's pretty much anything at\nthat point or were there we've done the\npediatrician as well the language that\nwas being used at the time was things\nthe questions that were being asked for\nme as a mom sounded like it was more to\ndo with schizophrenia you know mm-hmm\nyou know did she hear voices and then\nthere's like conduct disorders did she\ndid she start fires did she hurt animals\nlike\nthirty-six come on I would take that as\na mom I would be a little bit scared\nthere was a lot of there was a lot of\nfear and this Thea mother just were\nbigger and bigger and bigger and bigger\nand a bigger it grew the further I went\naway from her the further our\nrelationship deteriorated the the worse\nher behavior became and it was\ninteresting because eighteen months ago\nshe said that yes she said to me I\nremember that time mom and I remember\nwhat that felt like and I said you know\nand why did you I said do you remember\nwhen used to you know scream or you\nshe'd hide or she'd run out of the house\nshe trying to escape from school and\nclimb over the trying time over the\nfence and I said why did you you know\nwhy did you do that and she said because\nas she said the words so she said I\ndidn't feel safe I didn't feel safe at\nschool and I didn't feel safe with you\nand Dad and we are not the type of\nparents that were you know screaming and\nbeating her and all that kind of stuff\nbut whatever we did she just didn't feel\nsafe and to me when I look back now I\njust didn't have that connection and\nthat love with her so I was doing all\nthe things going through the motions\nNicole you know looking after taking it\nto school helping her to get dressed\nfeeding her I knew that there was no\nconnection there yes that's knowledge\nagain another really hard truth and just\nto tie back all of this in right those\nof us who were go-go-go yes and very\nlittle time and presence its meaning the\ncurrent moment and that's where all of\nthe beauty of being and feeling\nconnected not feeling alone all of that\nemotional content and exchange half the\ntime isn't even verbal happens in the\nmoment and I say that because I really\nto you I was always a million miles away\non to the next million things that I was\ngoing to do I view as a protection now I\nunderstand why I did that it was a very\nadaptive protection but that really\nlimited me from having those moments of\njust true presence and like I said I\nthink that's where connection and safety\nfor children happened so when we think\nabout you brought up a concept earlier\nconscious parenting what I believe is\nthe most\nPaul facet of conscious parenting is\nthat work consciousness is just taking a\nmoment I understand life happens I can't\nimagine how busy like I said life\nbecomes with children there's probably a\nmillion more things to do than I would\nalready create for myself or my brain\nwould are to pay for me but I say this\nto all the parents out there those few\nmoments any any anyway in a day where\nyou're just with your kid and not on to\nthe next thing I think that is where all\nof this beautiful connection and then\nthat translates to feeling safe and\nheard and seen and understood and I\nthink these are universal core once and\ndesires and needs that all of us have\nbut I think this is where all this inter\nis interconnected right so now you are\nthe adult mom very busy rightfully so\nthree out two other little ones running\naround outside of her right on to the\nnext and they think maybe that's what\nshe was picking up on not having those\nmoments of just you and her fully\npresent to each other which translate it\nunfortunately because I can't imagine\nwhat it might have been like to hear on\nyour end for her to acknowledge I'm\nfeeling safe because one of I'm sure\nyour greatest intention and motivators\nwithin the control was to keep her safe\nI mean and it's interesting actually\ntying in with your work with your\nincredible work by the way and I just I\nlove language every day and it's so\namazing and and one of the things that I\nthat I've learned as well so much more\nover the last couple of years is that\nwhen she triggered me with her behavior\nfor so long I would play the victim\noh oh you know why is this happening to\nme why does she have to be like this I\ndidn't have a great relationship with my\nmom my mom was an alcoholic he never had\na great relationship I pay myself saying\nyou know why I've gone to all this with\nmy mom and now I'm going to it with my\ndaughter why do I have to go through\nthis and then what I realize is only\nabout six months ago is about the\ntriggers and each when she would trigger\nme and she would do something I would\nthen really go into myself through like\nbreath meditation a journal and I'd try\nand read but I would start to see that\nthe behaviors that she was displaying I\nwas never allowed to display that as a\nchild so I was that child that was\nraised my dad would get on really well\nnow\nbut a strict and he was the kind of\nperson would say children should be seen\nand not heard\nso I was never allowed to express myself\nas a child I was net it was always if\nyou say that again\nyou're gonna Mighty One which was you\nknow on the bottom so I was never\nallowed to express myself and then I've\ngot this very spirited child who knows\nherself knows her mind knows what she\nwants she's come into this world just\nknowing who she is with incredible\nresilience and power for who she is she\nmakes no apologies and that would\ntrigger me and I started to realize\nshe's triggering me because it's stuff\nthat I haven't dealt with in myself so\nthe last sort of six months year has\njust been really delving into that and\nsee that she's filled me in so many ways\nI'm having chills over here Susie here\nall those insights in those connections\nand and I truly believe and I offer the\nsuggestion to us all to begin to really\nview our triggers as the teachers that\nthey are yes they're uncomfortable and\nyes I know myself may be able to speak\nfor myself right now\nI do really embarrassing shameful\nunsettling at times things sometimes\nwhen I'm really acutely triggered right\nI work to break those habits to make\ndifferent choices on what I do but I\ntruly value those moments when obviously\nit looked the fallout has you know\nbruster has kind of gone past me and\nwherever I brought my fallout to but\nultimately their teachers they give us\nthe content and I always suggest when\nyou are having either whether it's a\npatterned reaction okay every time this\nsort of thing happens I do I feel I\nthink I feel I do X Y or Z or when with\nthe simplest way I put is when we see an\nemotion or feel an emotional reaction\nfrom ourselves that is disproportionate\nif we're really honest to the triggering\nevent right if I look at the thing and\nit's like okay well these were really\njust dishes and I had this level of an\nemotional reaction maybe that doesn't\nmap on that\nso there's something deeper going on and\nthen the fact that when you did that\ndeep dive into what that must might be\ndeeper\nthat's a beautiful connection because I\neven mentioned right humans we want to\nbe seen and heard and so picturing now\nyour little child back in that home\nwhere the message was not that I mean\neverything from the direct message to\nthe indirect feeling and the fact that\nyou weren't foster to be seen as this\nunique individual all that probably\nlittle Suzy was allowed to show is\nwhatever was within the parameters of\nokay or acceptable behavior right and\nthen anything outside of those\nparameters got what was it the strong\none or how is it that nice to them the\nmighty one right I mean so before you\nknow it and that's what I believe that\nchildren are two things at our core we\nare intuitive and we're adaptive so\nlittle Suzy learned really quick how to\navoid getting the mighty one right so\nall of those parts of little Suzy that\ndidn't fit into what was deemed\nacceptable got pushed to an aside and\nthen so insightful that you were able to\nrealize now you had your own little\nintuitive free adaptive being and that\nthe part of you that was being touched\nwas a little girl who wasn't actually\nseen understood for who you are I can I\ncan't imagine\nput it this way the range of feelings it\nyou were having when you when you say I\nwas trigger I'm sure you were and I'm\nsure it was really complicated what you\nwere feeling in those moments you know\nit's been um I feel that I wrote\nsomething the other week and then it\nsaid the child behavior is past behavior\nis simply a vessel to wake you up to\nyour own healing that's been so huge for\nme to realize that her behavior has it's\nalmost been something that I needed to\ndo myself and this is what I love about\nyour work with the self healers because\nI went to see so many different experts\nand nothing against them you know\nthey're only trying their best to guide\nme but the my book is called saving\nSarah because what I felt is that I did\nsave her because I had to almost take\nher away from all\nthat I was the person that could help\nher and I was going to all these people\nyou know taking her to this place and\nthis man listen this person fix this\nlisten fixer this person can make it\nokay this person and then I actually\nrealized that it all lied within me and\nshe's been the biggest teacher it's been\nthe hardest lessons because when you\nhave this child that you know is has\nthis oppositional defiant disorder this\nanxieties ADHD um I don't truly ever\nthink that she had anxiety personally I\nthink um I think it was just I think it\nwas more to do with it you know the ADHD\neven not being able to concentrate a\nhyperactivity obviously it was coming\nthrough for anxiety if I think back that\nwhat she was going through but anyway\nwhat I learned is that I was a person\nand this is what I my message is to mums\nto to see inside of them they have the\nintuition to help and heal their\nchildren and the secondly to find their\ncloak of power and put it on because I\nthink that we give up our powers so much\nwe eat win\ndream where we feel that we don't have\nthe answers to our children and how to\nhelp our children and we feel that we've\nlost that and you know I really realized\nthat when I tried to get an appointment\nto see a pediatrician here in person\nthey had like a 12 month waiting list\nand I was like what is wrong with all\nthe children what's going on and that\nwas all it was so many waiting lists and\nthat's when I started to realize over\ntime I'm over realize yeah mums Work\nWeek we're not realising that these\nchildren have chosen us for a reason you\nknow they say know that there's\nsomething that we're gonna heal and in\neach other and that's such a big lesson\nand just really deep diving deep and so\nmany mums that I talk to else say you\nknow they'll tell me I don't not to do\nand I said what do you think you should\ndo you know after you get into closer\neyes put their hand on my heart just\nconnect back in with themselves because\nI feel that we do have the answers\nNicole we really do I I could not agree\nmore and I think we're this trans or or\nthe origination when we put it this way\nof this if we cannot trust ourselves and\nbe connected to ourselves and our own\nintuition when it comes to what is best\nfor us then of course we can't extend\nthat to\nour children and we feel even more\nhopeless and helpless especially when we\nhave allowed up into consciousness some\nreality of where we sit you know or the\nchildhood we had the more that we know\nthat kind of things weren't so great for\nus then we doubt even further our\nabilities I think as parents but I say\nthat because I think the vehicle in then\nto empowerment I love the talking about\nall things getting back our power and\nthat's a that was a big motivator for me\ndeveloping the hashtag in the concept of\nself-healing in the whole holistic\nwellness plan because I do believe that\nmost of us as humans spend way to a\ndisproportionate amount of time in our\nthinking mind which just over the years\nas we have accumulated years of n\nmoments not connected to our body\nourselves where our intuition is Howells\nmost of us that's why I'm always talking\nabout self-betrayal and lacking of trust\nin the self and need to rebuild and\nempower the self again because I believe\nthat the most people that I work with\nare the adult human now who is so\ndisconnected from that intuition that\nthey don't trust themselves and I get a\nmillion in loan questions of from these\npeople and and I have was one of them\nmyself so I speak from that group you\nknow it from from inclusion in that\ngroup to say that a lot of us look to\neveryone outside of ourselves to\noutsource our decision-making whether\nit's from I mean the messages that I\nsometimes get whether I should keep a\njob stay in a relationship you know it's\nlike you I can't tell no one can tell\nyou that let alone the whole world of\nobviously physical wellness going to the\ndoctor's I mean I come from I might as\nwell my family might as well be in the\nVIP I joke it's not funny but the VIP\nclub at the local hospital because\nthey're there every doctor outsourcing\nevery decision I say a lot to say that I\nthink the path in to trusting intuition\nwhen it comes to parenting first and\nforemost is to reconnect and rebuild\ntrust in oneself and one's own healing I\nthink that's a beautiful part of your\nown journey was the fact Susie that all\nalong the way you were doing your own\nhealing you were doing your own\nevolution\nand learning yourself and reconnecting\nwith yourself and building the trust and\nyour intuition because do you get a lot\nof parents that want to focus on the\nchild how I fix you know my little one\nin this flyer that way and you know I\nprobably give one of the most\nfrustrating answers back but it's always\nthe same it's always hey I won't give\nspecific parenting advice I'm not a\nparent I don't want to speak on things\nand I don't have direct experience with\nbut be my advice always is kill yourself\nbecause until you understand and you're\nreconnected with your own intuition and\nyou can figure out what's best for you\nyou are not going to be able to then be\npresent and then by extension helps to\nsupport your child to do the same so I\nthink that's been a beautiful part of\nyour journey to which you're fully\nembodying it says you've made this which\nis the reality of it a journey of your\nown self healing - and then by the\nbyproduct the beautiful byproduct of\nthat is now your daughter and your\nrelationship with her and probably your\nentire family heals that's the way in I\nhave people how do I feel my partner or\nmy kid my mom my dad and I say the only\nway to heal a relationship is to heal\nyourself and then it's so beautiful the\ntriple over the carry over where\nrelationships with an unconscious patife\nparty even can start to shift and change\nslightly but let alone when you have a\nchild who's receptive and open and still\nin that beautiful developmental time\nperiod Susie where so much change can\nhappen I mean you are really opening the\ndoor for a different future not only for\nyour daughter yourself your relationship\nand like I said your family that's\nincredible but I think it starts with us\nfirst yeah you know it was so right with\nthem with what you talked about then\nwould you kill her mama heal the child\nor heal you know heal the mother heal\nthe child that for me\nwas one of the biggest lessons when I\nreally looked at myself and I was going\nto all these external places as I've\ntalked about and shared to try and fix\nmy daughter and I remember the moment\nthat I just knew that it was it was over\nand we were driving one day and it was\nreally raining and I remember you know\nwhen it's raining you can't even see\nnight you know ahead and any days a\ndriver\nsee if you will just going for the best\nluckily but I thought I couldn't see the\npath ahead but in that moment I felt\nlike I could see my path and I pulled\nthe car oh she's probably Sarah was\nprobably eight maybe nine so we've been\ngoing down this pathway probably about\neight yes when we go into path for two\nyears and I pulled a car over and I held\nher hand and we just hadn't had any\nconnection at all and she felt that and\nI knew it and I knew that I had to sort\nmyself out and I said to her you know\nwhat I started to tell her about ADHD\nand I said listen you know really it's\njust a made-up word you know by some\ndoctors or whoever scientist whoever\nmade the name up and she described a\ncertain type of person and I started to\ntalk about like with chip Branson and I\nstarted to tell about Michael Phelps and\nI said Einstein at all about Einstein I\nthought he might have had ADHD and I\nstarted to talk about all these amazing\nthings that they brought to the world\nand that she was gonna bring incredible\nthings of the world and I said you know\nwhat it's over we're not gonna see any\nmore experts we're not gonna see any\nmore people we've done because you are\namazing for who you are and this is a\nkid who's like eight or nine and she\njust started to cry I literally cried\nand she held my hands and she said mommy\nshe looked into my eyes and she said\nmommy thank you thank you and I broke\ndown she died like a brick down over\nhere right now I mean again the exam the\nexperience I'm having this early inside\nI just thought gosh this little girl\nthat I have taken to all these people\ntrying to fix and in that moment I just\nfelt that the road was gonna change for\nboth of us and the path was gonna be\nclear and it was it almost changed\novernight what I realized is that I had\nto work on me and I did because at the\ntime Nicole I was really anxious I was\nreally depressed just my circumstance\nthat was making me feel like that you\nknow and I thought I've got to work on\nme and I started at the time I was\nbroken and I started to go through a\nspiritual awakening yeah that's a little\nbit about what would be helpful for the\nmothers listening out there because I\nknow that you know practical how do I\nget started I'm sure we're already a lot\nof people listening or probably very\nmuch connected\nvery much seeing these defense defending\nbehaviors and their child maybe you're\nstruggling probably are also feeling\nequally set up with the lack of answers\nout there so I mean what are you how did\nyou start to do the work then okay well\nI've got ADHD as well I got diagnosed a\ncouple of years ago so I did everything\nall at once all at the same time a\nmillion miles an hour\nso that was my awakening so I knew that\nI was at this place of complete\nbrokenness my marriage was not great my\nrelationships everything was just it\nfelt like I was in a big cess pit\nbasically I didn't know which way to\nturn that I had my awakening but I had\nmy moment and I thought this is it so I\nstarted to I started to do I started to\ngo to church I also started to mean New\nAge stuff as well so I started to get\ninto crystals and Angel cards and\nwomen's circles I now facilitate them\neach month because I'm so passionate\nabout connecting women I started to\nlearn to meditate I started to get into\nmy essential oils I started to get into\nnature I live like five minutes 10\nminute walk to the beach and I never\nwent to the beach now your show a lot by\nseason so I would just take my shoes off\nI would just be in nature\nI just took things out I must I must\nadmit that I had to move out of some\nfriendship circles because I knew that\nnothing against those beautiful women\nbut I knew they weren't right for me hmm\nand that was really difficult and really\nuncomfortable but I had to do the work\num I started to connect a lot more with\nmyself I started to pray listen I did\neverything and anything that I could do\nto get that connection back with this\nwith the universe with myself um and as\nI started to heal you know it wasn't\neasy it didn't happen overnight as I\nknow that you know you've talked about\nall of that but as I started to heal my\ndaughter started to heal and that was\nfor me was what would you start to say\nhow are you aware that your daughter\nstarted feeling\nshe started to become happier I noticed\nthat I wasn't getting the daily emails\nfrom school I would speak to the school\nand they would say you know what are you\ndoing you know she seems so different\nand it was actually called my husband\nthat said to me you know I feel like in\nall of this the person that really\nneeded healing with you um I think at\nthe time that really triggered me my\nmind was well I could have sat in two\ndifferent ways well not that's a\npositive I know I have been pointed out\nby my partner and not always happy and\nsmiling for the out of helpful\nobservation yeah I still trigger so and\nyeah and I think is as well that I that\nI knew that part of my healing was to\nget that connection with my daughter\nbecause I'd found myself you know\nfeeling that I didn't like her as well I\ndidn't like her and I knew that I had to\nfix that because the things that I\ndidn't like about her were the things\nthat I didn't like about me says a whole\nmirror thing going on as well yeah I\njust I just and I think what's beautiful\nnow is the work that you're doing\nbecause I didn't have that you know\nthere wasn't the holistic psychologist\nreal stuff so I was kind of fumbling\naround reading a few books actually all\nread a lot of books um you really\nstarted to connect with Eckhart Tolle\nand all his work and just yeah the more\nthat I healed the more that she healed\nand I remember the doctor i sat with the\ndoctor at the very beginning when I was\ngoing through this and I just said\nlisten can you help me I am broken and I\njust anything can he put me on some\nantidepressants anti-anxiety service\nanything and he was interesting because\nI could have every every medication\ngoing for my taunter but actually my\ndoctor didn't give me anything because\nhe said you're not depressed you're not\nanxious it's just your circumstance and\nif you just work on yourself go and see\nthe naturopath and she's amazing oopsey\ndon't mean she have many doctors like\nthis I'm very surprised the doctor you\nfound over there in Perth on the beach\nfirst person it said look go see the\nmatch\nwork on you work on on your start to see\nhim and said you know what you were\nright so when you have the mums that\ncome in and say I don't know what to do\nabout my kids please stop and he started\nlaughing but it was it was a real moment\nwhen I realized that it was it was me\nthat needed and when I slowed down when\nI worked on it myself\nand it's funny now because whenever\nsarin dose or time where she might be a\nreally hyper or really animated or\nreally something right you know happen I\nlook at me\nI think yep I'm going through life a\nmillion miles an hour again I'm not\nconnecting with her you know I don't\nhave mom guilt because I don't think\nit's worth it but I'm just I'm just\nhonor yep she's just again is my mirror\nI need to slow down and um it's pretty\nincredible really that's really really\nincredible and and I it to speak to your\npoint think that I want to commend you\nactually Susie for piecing together you\nknow the tools to indeed to start your\nown healing journey a big motivator\nmotivator for me to go online and have\nan account like Instagram I would never\nhave imagined it would you know kind of\ngrow as it is but was to have a place\nwhere we can put or where I could put\nout some version of a cohesive narrative\naround how heal because I remember when\nI was first starting my moon journey I\nwas very overwhelmed by the lack of that\ncohesive place to go and gather these\ntools so I was it sounds like doing\nsimilar to you right grabbing this book\nover here sigh all my nutritional stuffs\nI knew that was gonna be part of it and\nI all my you know meditation stuff and\nall the different authors and it was all\nher own and you know it was a bit\noverwhelming for me at first to calm and\nto sit to read and to put it together in\nmy mind into a concept so I say that to\nsay that I want to commend you for for\ndoing that and figuring out how heal\noneself and that has what has been for\nme and motivator and I know you're also\nputting out now you know could have your\nown versions of this information to help\nothers in terms of the journey that\nyou've experienced because I believe\nthat we are all we all have a story we\nall have a journey and not none of us\nknow letters after a mean or the only\nway to get credentialed if you will to\nshare and to teach and to help others to\nheal and I'm always ever hopeful when I\nsee other people stepping out and saying\nthese are my stories and this is what\nworked for me because I believe that\nlived experiences with them and that is\nwhat we can help impart other people\nwith tools through not just I went to\nschool and I have this after mine even\nif you have that great you know I'm sure\nthat you got some other tools while you\nwent along not trying to but it's just\nnot necessary so again it's you know I\njust I think that those of us who do\nshare and make ourselves vulnerable and\nput our stories out there are so\nempowering for others so I know you're\ndoing that over on your page and you\nhave a lot of resources that you are\nalso talking and books are involved so\nit's really incredible that you're\nputting now this out there so that other\npeople can can get some clarity or at\nleast get a first step like you said on\nit you know driving through that that\nstorm at least getting in the car right\nbecause I do agree with you I think this\napplies to all life whether it's our\npersonal evolution journey or our\nprofessional journey we are often not\ngifted with the path you know as it\nextends out in front of us usually we\nknow a step or two and then more often\nthan not you're walking through that\nstorm with trust that we are going in\nthe right direction and that the next\nstone will appear you know just another\nthing that I've just thought about as\nwell for you know the month of dads that\nare watching this is that the one thing\nthat fascinated me as well is\nepigenetics\nI'm just really learning you know that\nwhen I showed at the beginning obviously\nthat my daughter came from me so what\nsort of personality that I have she has\nthose traits and the same as well with\nto do with our epigenetics so also\nthings like we went down the whole route\nof looking at good house with her and\nall the issues that she had with her\ngood she had like heavy metals in her\nsystem all sorts of things that she had\nthat came back from all these tests that\nwe did like stool tests and hair and ice\nand stress I've had it I had a very\nsimilar genetic makeup to her so I\nrealized that\nthat yeah just we had all the same\nthings going on so we've done a lot of\nthat as well Healing her good mm-hmm\nfaithfully and gently removing heavy\nmetals from her system and just doing\nall that stuff as well so it's really\nimportant that parents know that yeah\nI've worked a lot on the emotional side\nof it as well but we've also looked at\nhealing her plate and that's amazing and\neven though we've done that and she's\nbeen like so much more focused in school\nthe teachers in like come and I work and\na work ethic she's still here she is so\nthese kids that we have these very\nspirited strong-minded kids as well um\nnothing can ever break that because\nthat's who they are and and I look at\nher now and I think I don't want to\nbreak that because the kind of person\nthat she is like she is just she's gonna\njust go places because she's somebody\nthat actually doesn't care what anybody\nthinks and I think what did give what a\ngood good absolutely fact about her\nshe's just she doesn't much she doesn't\nmind about she's matter how she looks\nshe's not bothered she won't even wear\nshoes it's just this really like\nspirited like kid and I think if I can\nkeep her like that one day she's gonna\nbe amazing and do incredible things in\nthe world because she's not gonna feel\nthat brokenness but that's really\nimportant I think that we sometimes\nthink that we can you know go and see\nthe experts do all this work and then we\nhave this very compliant normal child I\nrealize that's not gonna happen he's\ngonna be who she is and I just got to\nwork on me so I can hold the space for\nher strong I love that you said that I\nmy my brain filled that in as well that\nconcept of holding space I mean that's\nthat's a large function of a parent\nholding space or the child can feel safe\nenough to explore and to discover who\nthe child is and then having that space\nto Co experience each other so the\nparent showing up authentically in\npresence just be the parent a human and\nI actually read this beautiful part of\nthe Necker a new earth I don't know if\nyou've read the the more recent one that\nso I'm reading in the middle of that\nbook and he was talking and he wrote\nthis beautiful excerpt on parenting and\nhow you know when we really are present\nwe just become no matter of\nin our 50s and our child is in ER\nwhatever age it is or whatever age range\nthe span is between the two humans\nultimately we're just two humans\ninteracting we're just two energies two\nconsciousnesses that are kind of\ninteracting together in that moment we\ndon't even have to experience the\ndifference in age and I just that's what\npresents allows and I just think that's\nso such a beautiful way to think about\nparenting and I think you're right\nbecause you know another question for\nparents out there listening you know if\nif there is a concern of what my child\nis saying or doing really asking again\nin a very radically honest way might not\nlike the answer why of what concern is\nthat what would it mean if right because\na lot of times parents view children as\nan extension of him or herself of\nthemselves right so when my child is out\nin the world I'm really gonna simplify\nthis doing wrong or bad that's a\nreflection for me and they think so I\nuse just that as an example because if\nyou're a parent out there who is having\na concern about you know what you're\nseeing in your child and their behavior\nbased more on what others will think you\nknow really give yourself a heart a hard\nlook and wonder you know within yourself\nand turn aleeah's of what are the\nconcerns and what would be problematic\nbecause I think that's another area\nwhere we start to put parameters around\nbehavior that has again the theme of\nthis conversation you're not having has\nmore to do with us than with our child\nat all because the child is probably\nsimilar to your daughter okay with how\nthey are they learner we learn not to be\nokay based on the feedback that we can\nget and of course our caregiving\nenvironment our caregivers are the most\nimportant feedback that we could be\nlooking for so when we start to get a\nclue or a cue that this isn't you know\nappropriate or acceptable in mom and\ndad's world then we feel we have a\nconcern that love for mom and dad is at\nrisk so before we know it that part of\nourselves this is what ego is right that\npart of our self and our shadow self and\nall of that that gets tucked away\nbecause that's not acceptable now so now\nwe have and this is what I believe most\nof us end up being as an adult is an\nadult with different parts of ourselves\nwe are not a cohesive you\nkind of consciousness where the little\ngirl who's triggered in these situation\nis and then I'm in this situation on\nthis other part of myself that is gone\nand you know sanctioned off because I\ndid not have the space held and it was\nnot okay you know for me to be however I\nwas and I didn't have the safety and the\nfreedom of course we check all different\nboxes depending on who we are as an\nindividual and what our pasts have how\nthey have affected us but I think that's\nbeautiful and again I think that's agree\nyou know again ultimate goal process\ngoal because this is not the quick\novernight goal to achieve a parenting\nlearning how to hold space for your\nchild and who they are and their reality\nand their thoughts and their feelings\nwhich might be completely different than\nyours and not understandable at all to\nyours but you can solve curiosity and\naccept and like we're seeing old spaces\nor so really really incredible and I\nthink um one of the things as well that\nthat my daughter's what he taught taught\nme is when you were talking about then\nabout how we feel for this world judges\nand you know I was that mom that wanted\nto you know again going I think from\nfrom having my experience as a child\nwith my mom I really wanted to get it\nright so I always had this feeling that\nif my kids look do you know great washed\nhair and nice clothes like she's they\nlooked presentable I was doing a great\njob you know they were well-behaved and\nwe got for dinners and they could sit\nthere and which is really ridiculous we\nthink the kids could do that anyway in a\nrestaurant but it's what I learned is\nthat Sarah witness said that you know\nshe didn't wear shoes for a year so even\nin the winter I've had the school saying\nthat she's she's really it's like she\nwon't wear shoes she wish she wouldn't\nbrush her hair over hardly watch it so\nshe had like this dreadlock hair no\nshoes and no coat she looked like she\ndidn't belong and I tried to for a year\nget her to wear shoes wear a coat you\ncould he gets it you can get this all\nthe things and then when I said you know\nwhat I'm just gonna leave it she's who\nshe wants to be and I really accepted it\nand I thought it doesn't matter it's no\nreflection on me\nyou look like you don't belong to anyone\nit is no reflection on me as your mum\nI'm gonna let that go and when I let it\ngo within weeks\nthis kid started getting up at 6:30 she\nstarted washing her hair drying a half\nof the hair dryer putting on his shoes\nand I was like this is unbelievable\nand it realized that I don't think she\ndid that intentionally but I needed to\nlearn the lesson and I had to let it go\nwhen you know because she is that\nspirited child so we hope you do get the\nlooks when you're out not so much now\ncuz he's older when she was younger and\nI had to let it go that you know it\ndoesn't matter that that ladies just\nlooked over and trusted or that other\nperson they probably got triggers that\nthey need to deal with about their\nchildhood yeah my daughter there's so\nmuch truth there Suzie I love that I put\nthat out because that's the reality we\nare all walking around more internally\npreoccupied by our own reality and all\nthe stories that we're living on and in\nthat autopilot that yes we do see\nreactions that maybe we were that\ntrigger point for but I mean I say this\na million times over\nusually not about us at all and that's a\nreally to be able to be personalized in\nthose moments in all moments really is\nan incredibly helpful skill to say okay\nwell maybe maybe this person across the\nway it's having a feeling about what my\ndaughter is looking like right now you\nknow but chances are it's more about\nthis person you know\nthen my daughter or me I think that\nreally is an empowering shift it\nsuggests out there too so the more you\nknow as parents not only if you can\nrealize if you are the parent listening\nthat you know is overly concerned about\nothers opinions but ask yourself why and\nreally give yourself that opportunity to\nrealize that the opinions that you might\nbe getting from others might not even\nhave anything to do with you that don't\njust give you more and more freedom to\nhold the space for your children so\nreally incredible incredibly helpful\noffering right there and I think a\nreally great tool that a lot of parents\ncan can utilize and I think one final\nthing is Lana Kahn is to say to parents\nthat my life is completely messy you\nknow sometimes it's beautiful and I'm\nworking on the triggers seeing the\nreflections and all of that I mean\nsometimes it's it's messy\nand I get it wronged and I yell and you\nknow and I say the wrong thing and I\nthink you know so we still go through\nthat it's not old Mary Poppins over here\nat all and in Australia but um but I\nforgive myself you know I I cuz I think\none of the worst things I did for so\nlong is that whole guilt thing you know\ncuz that just wasn't helping anybody so\nI just you know and we're still learning\nmy daughter and I'm still learning still\ngot the teenage years to come you know\nshe's got a delay it's gonna be one big\njourney but realizing all the lessons\nthat I've learned and knowing that it's\nnot gonna be perfect it's not gonna be\nyou know Instagram perfect yes I love\nthat you I love that you said that\nyou're saying two really beautiful\nthings realities here which is some days\nwe're gonna just struggle we're going to\nnot be shiny\nI still do too right I can know my inner\nchild I can know when it's being\ntriggered I can really want to choose\nand have that awareness and then some\nmoments I make that little choice I\ndon't have my resources I'm tired I\ndidn't sleep well I'm stressed out right\nand and I do those old patterns like so\nfor me in my own healing journey that's\nright around the corner you know what I\nmean so there's some days where it\ndoesn't look pretty at all to be honest\nit looks downright messy to use your\nwhere is it that's gonna happen even\nwhen you have a family little ones\naround you so we think that you're right\nthe way that we have those moments live\non beyond the moment in a really\nunhelpful way is when we carry Shane out\nof it and when then we beat ourselves up\nand then before we know it two or three\ndays later we're still affected by what\nwe what is now solidified into a version\nof a mood a not so positive one that\nalso might be dictating the rest of the\nchoices we've been making over those\nthree days so now we have one moment in\ntime right expand to possibly days of\nmoments in time so when we can just\nseparate out that internal critical\nvoice is just like any other thing it's\njust a thought so when that happens we\njust get the hell out of it you also\nsaid something I think another beautiful\nperfect place to end which is the\nrealization even if you don't have the\nadolescence and the teenage years right\naround the corner you know what I mean\neven if maybe your kids are all out of\nthe house and you know kind of at a at a\nmore stable developmental period like\nthe still a journey does not mean and\nI personally sought for this ideal\nhammock utopian place in the sky where I\nwas I loved the word done where I was\ndone and I all of my boxes were checked\nfrom now until forever more and this is\nthe person that I am now and it's going\nto be a stable person as I walk into the\nfuture so sorry but I have not found\nthat I do not believe that exists so\nlife is an evolution life is a journey\nand I think the more we can settle into\nI think for what for many of us is\nsomething discomfort around that fact\nyou know that oh this is something that\ncan shift and change and that isn't a\nstable and I am never really fully done\nthere is no the saying right top of the\nmail in especially with children you\nknow I think that that's an incredible\nacceptance to offer oneself is that\nthings are shifting and changing and\nthat's life right life is more about\nimpermanence than comment so when we can\nget comfortable walking into the unknown\nwhether it's the adolescent years or the\nteenage years or just tomorrow we can\nbecause we trust ourselves because we're\nconnected to our intuition because we\ncan make the to carve out the moments\nthe figure was best for us and then by\nextension all of our relationships then\nI think we can walk confidently into the\nunknown which is the future for all of\nus so I think that's a beautiful a\nbeautiful I'm happy you brought up that\nconcept of the journey aspect of it\nbecause I think a lot of us struggle\nwith that reality we want it to be done\nwe want to get to the place where we can\nrelax now and you know that's why I'm so\nmuch a proponent of figuring the ways to\ndo this work the work consistently it\ncan be done on a daily basis it's a\nlifestyle shift that's why I always use\nthose languages but it's one that we\njust have to get comfortable in because\nI don't I haven't found the end point\nyet I haven't found the finish line and\nI think it's just about sustaining these\nchoices and this consciousness which get\neasier I mean I'm not gonna paint the\npicture black you know we get easier and\nwe get more knowledgeable and more\nwisdom and more experience and we learn\nto navigate these relationships\ndifferently and you know it shifts do\nhappen but they just we have to keep\nwalking the journey yeah I am so Susie\nI'm so excited to release this I think\nthat the people the community everyone\nlistening parents\nwe're gonna get so much value I just\nlove everything you said you're doing\nyour living you're saying you're sharing\nand I'm just so thankful for you taking\nthe time to have on here and I really\nreally appreciate it well thank you for\nhaving me and it's just amazing to to\ntalk to you that about these things it\nreally is beautiful so thank you so much\nof course of course all right take care"
