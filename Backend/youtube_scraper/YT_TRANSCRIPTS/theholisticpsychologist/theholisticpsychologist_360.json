    "transcript": "so in this video I'm going to talk about\nthree steps to heal your inner child I\nreleased a video last week on what the\ninner child is I will link it below so\nfor those of you who have questions you\ncan check that out so a first step to\nhealing our inner child is to\nacknowledge that we all have an inner\nchild is to become conscious of that\nfact so if you're listening out there\nand you didn't have the big glaring\nmemory of a childhood trauma I think the\nway you know most of us think of trauma\nthat doesn't mean that you didn't still\nsuffer a wound from childhood have an\nunmet emotional need some of these\nwounds are just consistent moments in\ntime we were very young where our needs\nweren't acknowledged or weren't\nconsidered or weren't met in a way that\nfelt good to us so also remember we\ndon't necessarily need to have the\nmemory of the thing that happened\nchances are we're still carrying the\nwound in our beat beliefs about\nourselves about our relationships we're\nstill carrying the wound in our\nreactions that we're seeing in our adult\nlife as an adult we may look back on our\nchildhood and you know think and review\nsome scenes of it you know think okay\nthings weren't that bad I often hear\nthat a lot\nyou know this memory this thing this\nthing that happened wasn't so bad it's\nimportant to remember that we're looking\nback from our adult self with the\nwareness --is worth another level of\nemotional maturity understanding more\nabout ourselves the world other people\nso from our adult self looking back it\nmight not seem that bad but what we have\nto remember is at the time we were a\nchild we were making sense of the world\nin a different way we had a different\nlevel of consciousness so as a child and\nmight and probably did feel way worse\nthan it does when we look back so the\nfirst step in healing is to become aware\nthat we all have this part of our self\nhow do we know we know because we are\ntriggered so what is a trigger a trigger\nreally to put it simply is a\ndisproportionate emotion\naction to something maybe smaller that\nhappens in our current life I'll use a\npersonal example one of my triggers for\na very long time in my relationship was\nundone house chores really the dishes\nright so I would come home and I would\nsee dishes in the sink I would find\nmyself losing it I would be upset\nI threw dishes into the sink sometimes\ndisgruntled doing the dishes and so that\nright that to me indicated the bigness\nof my reaction I felt you know a lot of\ndifferent feelings on a really big level\nabout dishes and so let's be honest here\nour objective dishes really shouldn't if\nyou will cause that much of a reaction\nso that to me was an indicator that\nsomething deeper was going on so those\nout there listening this is a great\ngreat red flag if you find yourself\nconsistently having a big feeling about\nsomething maybe not so big in reality we\nshould look deeper and what we need to\nidentify for ourselves is what's going\non what is the underlying emotion so for\nme the more I became aware conscious of\nmy internal world I would notice that as\nI would see those dishes my brain my\nmind would start to say certain things\nand what my mind said in response to\nthese dishes was how dare she she\ndoesn't care about me I'm not being\nconsidered so realizing that I had this\nnarrative that I was saying myself and\nresponse to these dishes I think now we\ncan understand why the feeling I was\nhaving was so big because the feel not\nconsidered felt hurtful in me felt\nangering to me and that's what provoked\nmy yelling and screaming about the\ndishes\nso it was important look at those big\nflags look at your big feelings and then\ndive down in there ask yourself what is\nit about what is the meaning what is the\nunderlying feeling that I'm having once\nI know that I can ask\nand her child what it needs to be\nwhatever the feeling is so for me it was\nwhat does it need to be considered so in\nthat moment being honest with myself and\nrealizing that I wanted to be in an\nempowered place so I wanted to be able\nto meet my own need of being considered\nI was able to give myself a choice to do\nnow two new things I was able to do the\ndishes for myself because that was\nimportant I like a clean kitchen so I\nwas able to consider myself by doing the\ndishes and then I was able to consider\nmyself and my inner child by doing\nsomething that I like to do by putting\nmyself first so after the dishes I was\nable to go and sit down and read for a\nlittle bit I like to read that makes me\nfeel good so in that way I was able to\nleave that experience feeling good\nfeeling empowered feeling positive about\nmyself because of the new choices that I\nwas able to make if I would have ranted\nand raved about the dishes which I did\nfor a long time I left that experience\nfeeling badly feeling shameful sometimes\nfeeling guilty because of the mean\nthings that would come out of my mouth\nand more often than not my relationship\nwas now in conflict that didn't feel\ngood so by becoming aware this was a\nwounded part of myself by looking at\nwhat was driving that wound and not\nfeeling considered and by asking and\nmeeting that need for myself and my\nchild by considering myself by doing the\ndishes by considering myself by making a\nchoice for me I was able to live leave\nthat situation feeling so much more\nempowered I was able to leave feeling\nreplenished instead of depleted as I\nwould have felt if I wasn't for screamed\nand yelled about the dishes now remember\nthis is really really hard work it took\nme a lot of repetition a lot of\nobservation of my child a lot of\nexploration and a lot of shifting into\nthat awareness in that moment to make\nthese new choices so don't get\nfrustrated as you try to unpack and\nexplore and change your responses\nbecause it's hard work it takes\nconsistent efforts but it is so\nrewarding if you can\nunderstand these parts of ourselves that\nthey're there they're there for all of\nus understand what these parts need and\nnow us the adult that we are meet those\nneeds\non our Oh so thank you guys for\nlistening if you like what you saw here\ntoday please feel free to hit subscribe\nand turn on your alerts every Sunday I\nrelease a new YouTube video"
