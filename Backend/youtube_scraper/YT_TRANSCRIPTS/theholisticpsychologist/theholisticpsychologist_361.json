    "transcript": "hello doctor no Kolhapur the holistic\npsychologist here I want to thank all of\nyou who have already subscribed to my\nyoutube channel if you guys like what\nyou see feel free to subscribe\nafterwards so this video is a quick\noverview on the inner child\nwhat is the inner child the inner child\nwe can think of as part of our mind that\nstores all of our emotional experiences\nfrom childhood so even though we are no\nlonger in childhood think of it as a\nlittle lens through which we view our\ncurrent experiences a lot of times this\nlens and these these wounded places\nparts of ourselves contribute to the\nreactions that some of us will see in\nour relationships sometimes they'll\ncontribute to the choices that were\nmaking in our careers in our\nprofessional world\nthey might even affect the choices that\nwe make raising our own children so\nwhile we have now grown like I said\nthese are wounded parts of ourselves\nthat are still contributing to the\nthings that we're doing daily for some\nof us consistently on a daily basis why\nis that the case so something important\nto understand is that when we are in\nchildhood usually around from birth to\nage 7 H E we are in an altered state of\nconsciousness and that alter state of\nconsciousness is something called\negocentric or it has an egocentric point\nof view so what that means is that we\nfilter all of the experiences that\nhappen to us during that age period\nthrough a self assigned meaning so I'm\ngoing to use an example because I know\nthat probably sounds confusing all that\nmeans is so if we have say a father you\nknow dad comes home from work every day\nin a grumpy mood because we're children\nwe might not be aware that the reason\nwhy dad is grumpy is because he is a\nstressful job or his boss tears into\nthem or there are financial concerns and\ndad's always worrying about not knowing\nthose things as a young child the\negocentric meaning that we could apply\nto seeing that's grumpiness is that we\nare not worthy of love or we are not\ncared about by dad and then that becomes\na story that we tell herself every time\ndad comes home in that grumpy state\nagain let's remember like I said because\nwe carry those with us as we grow how\nthis could look in adulthood is very\nvery similar right so our partner might\ncome home and she or he might similarly\nbe grumpy or had a bad day we might find\nourselves retelling that same story\nright so our partner is is short with us\nand we must mean he or she doesn't love\nus or doesn't care about us same thing\nwith a friend maybe we're not hearing\nback from our friend not texting us back\nwe might find ourself going down that\nsame pathway and assigning the same\nmeaning right this friend might must not\ncare about our relationship\nI must not matter to this friend again\nwhether or not that's true in reality\nmight not be the case but that is a\nwounded part of ourself that's assigning\nthat meaning and then we can imagine the\nreactions that we might have so it's\nimportant to think of this inner child\nand the wound as a part of ourselves it\nis not our self and what happens is when\nwe react from that wounded place if we\nreally understand our reaction or look\nback on it usually after the fact it's\nreally hard he thinks for some of us to\ndevelop the awareness during the moment\nwe might see a similar\nmechanism right we might see a tantrum\nyou know our partner coming home we\nmight scream yeah\nstorm off or some of us do the other end\nof the spectrum we check out we numb our\nself we dissociate again that reaction\nis coming from that really wounded child\nand it probably looks like the same\nthing we did in childhood when we\nsuffered that wound so it's important is\nto remember that this is not yourself\nthis is just a part of yourself the self\nthat we all can cultivate as we are now\nthe adult is awareness is being able to\nobserve that this is a reaction that is\ncoming from a very old hurt and then it\nmight not reflect the reality the more\nwe work to expand our awareness and now\nlike I said earlier it is so incredibly\ndifficult to do it in these moments but\nwe can practice and we can get to that\npoint but the more we cultivate that\nawareness the more opportunity we have\nto make a new choice so when my partner\ncomes home and I try or my you know\nsubconscious my wounded Trott child\ntries to assign the meaning that he or\nshe doesn't love me the more I'm able to\ncultivate awareness and tap into the\nself that has remained adult self I can\nnow have a choice I don't have to stomp\noff I don't have to disconnect or\ndisassociate I can choose to do\nsomething different and that is how we\nheal the inner child I'm gonna go more\ninto healing with some quick and easy\nsteps next week so if you guys are\ninterested please stay tuned if you like\nthis video please hit subscribe\nturn on your notifications every Sunday\nand YouTube video will come at you"
