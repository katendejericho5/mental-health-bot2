    "transcript": "hi dr. Nicola para holistic psychologist\nhere thank you guys for subscribing to\nmy channel if you guys like what you see\nand you have not subscribed please feel\nfree to do so\nturn on your notifications every Sunday\nI will be putting out a new YouTube\nvideo so today I want to talk about the\ndreaded but really helpful concept of\nboundaries I get a lot of messages about\nboundaries\nI struggle myself with boundaries this\nis a tough one this has to do obviously\nof course with relationships what\nboundaries simply are our rules in a\nsense teaching people where our lines\nwhere our limits how we want to be\nspoken to talked about talk to what\nwe're willing to do or not do I mean\nthis you know is a pretty big bag but\nessentially it's where our limits how do\nwe want to see ourselves or experience\nourselves in relationships so I've\nbroken this down into three big steps\ncreate state and maintain so in order to\ncreate boundaries it is incredibly\nimportant for each of us as individuals\nto give a think have some meditation you\nknow consider the relationships in our\nlife the ones that are going well the\nones that we struggle with and to define\nfor ourselves shifts or changes that\nwould be helpful so for instance I think\nit's really important to get in touch\nwith your why right so why am i\nconsidering changing the way that I am\nin this relationship what changes might\nI need to make in terms of this\nrelationship to get my why actualize so\nto use myself as an example I come from\nan intensely codependent and meshed\nfamily I obviously was not aware of this\nas I grew up and matured I started to\nsee the ways that I was acting in all of\nmy other relationships so my romantic\nrelationships my friendships etc that\nwere very similar to the way that I was\nin my family unit meaning I had a level\nof dependency I didn't have if you will\na full secure separate independent\nself so my why was I need boundaries and\nrelationships particularly with family\nmembers so that I can be independent so\nthat was my why connecting with that Y\nwas incredibly helpful to keep me taking\nthose next two steps implementing my\nboundaries because this is hard but I\nwas so clear on my Y and knew that it\nwas so important that I make those\nchanges because by this point I didn't I\nhad accumulated a whole lot of evidence\nof what operating in that more dependent\nway brought me in relationships and it\nwasn't good I was always focused on\nsomeone else I didn't feel like my needs\nwere being met I felt not her not\nunderstood I mean really the list goes\non so for me I realize that in order to\ndevelop an independent separate self in\nall my relationships I need to start to\nmake small changes so I gave some\nthought into what they would be so that\nmeant that I would have to consider\nmyself when I was taking calls making\nplans playing functions and\nrelationships etc etc so I really I got\nI got honest with myself and I looked at\nthe relationships that I that I felt\nparticularly challenged in so I'm gonna\nuse just one specific relationship to\nhighlight some of these changes that I\nthen started to implement so I realized\nthat to be a separate and develop a\nseparate independent self I would have\nto first start being a little less\navailable so the person that popped into\nmy head that I felt ever available at\non-call 2 was my sister she would call\nme for everything under the Sun\nsometimes they were what felt like you\nknow a more crisis and most of the time\nthey were just small little bumps in the\nroad but regardless my phone ringing I'd\nget a text I was always on the other egg\nand that's where I came in right me\nhaving to be honest and realize that I\nwas the one answering those texts I was\nthe one not having a boundary so what\ndid that mean that meant that I needed\nto start to be a little less available\nso using her as an example I've been\nannounced\n- I'm clear I know this is important I\ncan imagine how I would feel differently\nnot only with her but with all of my\nrelationships so I decided I was gonna\ndo something and what I was gonna do\nlike I said let's be a little less\navailable so step two state it right so\nlooked a little something like this hey\nyou know sis I have a lot going on in my\nworld and I actually need to not be you\nknow kind of always at the end of the\nfilm call or the text for you there are\nsome days where quite honestly I'm tired\nI'm drained and I just don't have\nanything left so on those days I'm not\ngonna be able to be available to you all\nright you can say this in any way the\nmost important part though is that you\nare able to separate yourself in that\nmoment or in following moments from\nwhatever the reaction is meaning this\ncould be something that is accepted and\nheard and understood and till you\nobviously tried to implement and then we\nwill talk about that later or this could\nbe something that's argued about or\ncombate it with or not understood there\ncould be a million different reactions\non the other end of stating this new\nboundary a couple different reasons one\nof the reasons is this person likely is\nused to you in one way and now here you\nare saying hey person I'm not gonna be\nthat way that you're used to me anymore\nI'm gonna be this new way that is is can\nbring up and trigger a million different\nfeelings in this other person the point\nof this the step two though is that\nwe've stated what we need and then if we\ncan to the best of our ability we're\ngoing to separate from whatever the\nreaction is of this other person all\nright because it could be accepting like\nI said and it could be some\ncompetitiveness okay this and like I\nwill always say another person could\nhave been their feelings and these\nmoments aren't our responsibility we're\nalready doing something that's hard I\ncan imagine\nI know it was for me saying this was\nhard it was like one of those you know I\nwrote the text and I threw my phone type\nof things like this isn't easy so we\nneed to respect ourselves and the\nfeelings that at this point are probably\nreally gonna start coming up for us so\nfor me I already had my feel bad and my\nguilt setting in when I delivered the\nmessage I didn't even do it yet which\nbridge is step three\nI've stated it now I have to maintain it\nmeaning when that next text comes in or\nphone call comes in that actually do\nwhat I said I I'm gonna do right and I\ndon't pick it up or I'm not responsive\nimmediately I wait for tomorrow or the\nnext day to you know kind of give that\nresponse this is critically important\nbecause there are like I said so many\nways that the person on the other side\ndoes not like this new dynamic that\nwe're shifting into is there are going\nto be feelings that come up for this\nperson and you might get to hear about\nthem and they're probably not going to\nfeel good and that could back us up into\na corner where we could feel like we\nneed to go back into this old way of\nbeing that is a really bad message to\nsend because what that is doing on some\nlevel is reinforcing this other person\nthat if they kick and scream you know\njust using figurative words if they kick\nand scream enough that we'll go back to\ndoing as they want\nremember relationship dynamics just take\ntime they can this relationship that\nfeels really conflictual right now\nbecause we're trying to be a new way in\nit over time could go and turn into the\nmost balanced fulfilling relationship\nfor many of you so it's incredibly\nimportant to whether the difficulty now\nand I'm the first one to admit it's\ngonna be hard it's gonna be hard like I\nsaid here's another hurdle where my\nfield bands came in my guilt my sister\nat one point called me selfish right for\nnot being available I really had to take\na moment without responding to her when\nshe was saying these things to me and\nask myself some more questions okay well\nshe thinks I'm selfish you know is that\na problem and my selfish do I consider\nmyself to be selfish my answer is no I\ndid not feel I was selfish person I felt\nbecause I took the time right at this\nstage of creating that I was having\ndetrimental effects not only in the\nrelationship with her but my other\nrelationships because I wasn't putting\nmyself on a priority\nso thinking about it through my lens I\ndid not think I was selfish if maybe if\nI did or if I even consider trying on\nselfish I would come to the conclusion\nthat it's not so bad either another\ngreat question is okay well if this were\nto be true whatever the person is saying\nnow about me because they do not like\nwrite this new dynamic I could really\nexplore it try it on okay well if this\nis true Wow would this be a problem for\nme what would it mean for me right I\nthink this is important because like I\nsaid once we've been able to maintain it\nand resist the urge to go back into our\nold habit with this person now we just\nhave more you know kind of information\nand self exploration that we can do that\nwe can try to understand ourselves\nbetter but like I said incredibly\nimportant to maintain those boundaries\nbecause each time we don't we give the\nperson the okay to push back in that way\nto continue to elicit that same behavior\nand like I said relationship dynamics\ncan change over time the function that\nwe once played for someone so me being\never available to my sister if I'm able\nto maintain my boundary before I know it\nthis relationship will settle into a new\ndynamic one where she doesn't expect me\nto be ever available to her anymore\nbecause that's the responsibility and\ncreating boundaries that I have to hold\nI played a part in allowing this\nrelationship to get to where it is now I\nsaid yes\nall of those times I was always there so\nnow because I want to create my\nindependence I want to be separate which\nmeans I have to be less connected I have\nto be less available I've stated this I\nlet everyone know it's no surprise now\nthis is what you're going to see or\nexperience different of me and now I\nhave to continue to be that different\nperson boundaries in relationships are\nhard\nI get it they're a work in progress but\nthey can go an incredibly long way to\nnot only changing the way we feel about\nour selves our relationships our worlds\nit can be so important to to just stick\nthrough it to tolerate all of the\ndiscomforts and like I said they're\ngoing to be different from Everett for\neveryone and they're going to be there\nthe end result of this can be a\nhealthier happier more sustainable\nrelationship so let me know what you\nguys think of boundaries what your\nstruggles are any successes that you've\nhad down below I'd love to hear from you"
