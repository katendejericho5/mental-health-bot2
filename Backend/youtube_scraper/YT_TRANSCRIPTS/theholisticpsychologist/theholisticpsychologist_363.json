    "transcript": "hi guys dr. Nicola para the holistic\npsychologist here thank you everyone for\nsubscribing to my channel those of you\nwho haven't if you like what you see\nplease subscribe and turn on your\nnotifications I will be releasing a new\nYouTube video every Sunday so today I\nwant to talk a really easy breezy\nbeginner how to meditate I am such a\nproponent of meditation it is an\nincredibly important skill I call the\nskills I'm going to tell you why that I\nthink every one of us can develop and\nit's going to go a long way if we do so\na couple of things about meditation\nfirst and foremost I'm going to dispel\nsome myths meditation is not often a\nzen-like experience it is not a passive\nexperience meaning I don't sit there and\nwait for something to happen and be\nmeditated it is really it's an active\nexperience like I said there's tools\nthat I suggest we work on developing\nwhile we're meditating so it's something\nwe're doing we're not waiting for\nsomething to happen again it is not Zen\nour goal is not to battle our thoughts\naway or or to get to a place where we're\nthoughtless because that's just not\npossible we can't control our thoughts\nbut meditation helps us to change our\nrelationship with them it can also be\noverwhelming this might be for some of\nyou the first time you're sitting with\nyourself and your thoughts and I'm going\nto tell you what it's a lot of\nuncomfortable things that come up we can\nsee some thoughts or hear some thoughts\nor experience ourselves having some\nthoughts it can be really uncomfortable\ndownright dark scary a million different\nyou know adjectives could apply here we\nmight start to feel restless feel\nuncomfortable in our bodies this is all\ntotally normal this like I said it's the\nfirst time where some of you might be\nsitting without the endless distractions\nthat we have throughout a given day\nright we are going throughout our day we\nhave to work\nwe're in our thoughts or everywhere else\nso we are distracted so when we are not\ndistracted when we are sitting in\nsilence we're going to all of this is\ngoing to called cascading back and a lot\nof us it's going to overwhelm us so\nwhenever we start a meditation practice\nI suggest literally 1 to 2 minutes do\nnot get crazy do not think I'm sure a\nlot of you know meditators or have heard\nof 7-day retreats or 30 minutes and now\nwe're here and their eye that is like I\nsaid not not a great place to start\nbecause that can be really overwhelming\nand the last thing we want to do is\noverwhelm ourselves right out of our\ntrying this again\nand I know that I have had that\nexperience back when I discovered\nmindfulness was really resistant to\ndoing it consistently because like I\nsaid I would get agitated in my body my\nthoughts of erasing I think about a\nmillion things I should be doing or\ndoing next or what's for dinner or\nwhatever it was my thoughts were a mile\na minute so I avoided it so literally 1\nto 2 minutes is a great start so how do\nwe meditate we go and we sit somewhere\nwhere we are as free of distractions as\npossible now of course I know this is\ngoing to vary you know for all of you\nwhere that place is or when it happens\nbut just carving out some time so I sit\nliterally in a room like this on a\ncushion like this I do so in the in the\nmornings you know so I get up it's part\nof my morning routine and what I will do\nis I will just bring myself to quiet I\nwill close my eyes because remember one\nof our goals is to limit the amount of\nthings and distractions places for our\nattention to go what we want to happen\nis to meet ourselves to see what our\nthoughts are all about to sit with our\nfeelings this is so empowering to learn\nthat there is a human and entity\nwhatever you might call that your spirit\nyou know your inner being your soul\nthere's a person that makes each of you\nyou that is separate from\nit's going on in your mind all day or\neven the way your body feels there's an\nentity that's separate from that so\nsitting alone in my room right and I can\njust allow my self to calm take a few\ndeep breaths and what I'm doing is I'm\njust sitting there and I'm breathing and\nwhat's inevitably gonna happen is my\nmind start racing right so this is now\nwhere we are working on two skills we\nare working to not attach to our\nthoughts to not jump down the crazy hole\nof our thoughts so those of you who have\never done a guided meditation or a\nYouTube video might have heard thoughts\nbe called right the cars on the road the\nclouds in the sky right the waves in the\nocean learning how to just develop what\nwe call an observational or a witness\nstance\nmeaning I'm just watching them thing so\nI'm sitting here I entity that is me is\nseparate from them and I'm watching my\nthoughts as they start to crank up all\nright so I might be sitting here and my\nthought might say oh what's gonna what\ndo I need to do next today oh we should\ngo to the same you have email so right\ndon't you get back to that person right\na million miles a minute\nI'm gonna watch those thoughts happen\nand I'm gonna release my attention from\nthose and this is the second skill and\nrefocus my attention on my breath this\nattentional skill is a called a muscle\nit's something we have to develop we all\nbelieve it or not it have choice as to\nwhere we put our attention\nwe just haven't accessed that choice in\na really long time\nso most of us myself included have lived\nor are living literally under the\ndictatorship of our thoughts right so\nour thoughts are always there and I\ndon't feel like I can choose to put my\nthoughts anywhere my attention anywhere\nelse\nwhat this translates to for a lot of us\nis I run a page of a bulk right simple\nexample I don't remember what I read i\nsat in a lecture I wasn't paying\nattention right I was there in body even\nmy in the book reading example my eyes\nare scanning my page but I\npaying attention because my attentional\nspotlight was lost in the rabbit hole of\nmy mind so when I'm sitting and I'm\nmeditating\nI'm just focusing on my breath and my\nthoughts come and I'm separating myself\nfrom those thoughts and I'm letting them\ngo some of us like to label them up\nthere it was my you know to-do list\nthought there is my inner critic thought\nand then I'm choosing and I'm\nstrengthening that muscle putting my\nattention back on my breath doing that\nfor even a minute two minutes at most\nconsistently like I said earlier can be\nso empowering this is a space where not\nonly do we meet ourselves some of us for\nthe first times but we empower ourselves\nwe show us that we can separate\nourselves from our mind that we can get\npast that that we are stronger than that\nthat is so critical that then over time\nso like I will say whether I'm talking\nabout\nbreath learn from meditation or any\nother tool that I suggest we use we sit\nand we develop it on this cushion right\nso the more consistent time it was more\nconsistent one minute two minutes that I\nhave add up teach me those skills or\nallow me to teach myself those skills\nand then before I know it I can use that\nuse that separation use that choice of\nattention throughout my day because that\nis where great are triggers our patterns\nlive so like I will always say there's\ntools there's places where we practice\nthe tools right on my meditation cushion\ndoing my breath work but what is\nincredibly important is that those tools\ntransfer into my day so wherever it is\nin your world carve out a minute find a\nquiet spot just tune into yourself be\nprepared some of you might feel highly\nuncomfortable with what you see in your\nthoughts with what you feel as a result\nof those thoughts with how you feel in\nyour body hanging over the bed\na coach at cushion makes us all really\nantsy right all of that is is you\nteaching yourself how to sit in all of\nthis how to choose to sit in it to\nseparate yourself from your thoughts and\nto put your attention where you want it\nso important so those of you who have\never tried meditation I would love to\nhear what you find helpful what you\nstruggle with because that's the reality\nthere that sometimes it's hard those of\nyou who are new to it I would love to\nknow what you think thank you guys for\ntuning in"
