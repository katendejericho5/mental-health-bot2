    "transcript": "hi guys so today I want to share with\nyou a way to release emotional energy\nthat's stuck in our body so our bodies\nare made up of energy the energy travels\nalong very specific pathways that are\nalso called meridians what happens when\nour energy can't flow freely you know\nalong those pathways is we can\nexperience physical symptoms we can\nexperience emotional symptoms so anyone\nout there who's going through\nacupuncture that's where those needles\nare being placed they're actually being\nplaced very specifically along points in\nthe body that are connected to our\nmeridian system that if there is any\nstuff energy in those points it frees it\nup it releases it and then allows whoa\nreally again and that's usually why\nanyone who's going to acupuncture\nfeels better sometimes even feels better\nemotionally afterward the cool thing is\nthere are techniques that we can use at\nhome on ourselves using literally our\nfingers and free up that energy just as\nsuccessfully so some of you guys might\nhave heard of something called EFT what\nit stands for actually is emotional\nfreedom technique so these are\nessentially the steps my overview don't\nfor us with how to release any energy or\nany feeling around any experience we\nmight have so I'm gonna use I'm gonna\nidentify an issue I'm going to use a\nexample of I had a bad day at work you\nknow my boss gave me some negative\nfeedback now I'm used to going in my\nmind I'm now gonna lose my job I come\nhome from work I'm tense in my body\nmaybe I'm replaying you know kind of\nwhat I did wrong I'm worrying I'm gonna\nwalk in tomorrow and have my desk packed\nup right so if I were to rate on a 0 to\n10 scale with 0 being so my feeling\nI'm essentially we do call anxiety I'm\nnervous I'm scared of dress power to\nreach that on a scale of zero to ten so\nzero being no anxiety it off to ten\nextreme you know maybe maybe this time\nit's going to eat me and nervous that\nyou know this time I'm in hand so each\ntime you go through this we need to have\na set up statement these statements\ncontain two things they can't contain an\nacknowledgment right of the negative\nfeeling I'm having so for me would be\nanxiety and each of these is always\nfollowed up by a statement about\nregardless of the feeling of having\nhowever negative it is about my\nunconditional love for myself so a great\neasy simple way to put that you guys can\nliterally use a statement in any people\nyou love and accept myself so my setup\nstatement is going to be even though I\nfeel anxious I deeply love and accept\nmyself so the way this looks right so\nI'm going to think about my plate with\nmy or my bad day maybe my negative\nfeedback with my boss and I'm going to\nbe sitting in that I'm gonna feel my\nlevel eight of anxiety this is really\nimportant it's really important that we\nput ourselves into the feeling so that\nmy body right I'm activating the energy\nin my body of that anxiety and I'm\nfeeling it so it's about me eight right\nand now I'm going to begin with my setup\nstatement even though I'm feeling\nanxious I deeply love and accept myself\nso then I'm going to start tapping\nsequence so I drew out for you but we\naren't the there are nine points and\nthese are very these are on all of us\nthat we want to go through as we're\ndoing our tapping so the first point is\nI'll just show you them quickly point\nthem out and then I'll go through this\nso the first point is called the karate\nchop point it's literally on the outside\nwhere our pinky finger is of our arm\nlike we're chopping the second point is\nbetween our eyes third point outside of\nour eyes fourth point under our eyes\nfifth point right below our nose six\npoint all right above our chin\nright seven points so if you were to put\ntwo fingers on here kind of chest right\nhere\nyou'll feel two indents right those are\nthat's where point seven is point eight\nis put it up right down here kind of\nwhere our lymph node you guys might be\nfamiliar where they are when you tap\nthese they might be sensitive some of\nthe points actually might be sensitive\nyou might notice that and then nine is\ntop of our head okay so now I'm set up\nso I'm going to identify the issue right\nor feeling in feeling anxious I'm\nfeeling like they might big hand\nit's about any even though I'm feeling\nanxious I deeply love and accept myself\nand now I'm gonna do my tapping sequence\nwhile I'm doing my tapping sequence I'm\ngonna hold on to that feeling of anxiety\nalright and I'm gonna just use I'm not\ngonna have to make that statement each\ntime so my tag or my reminders just\ngonna be my anxiety right so then I'm\ngonna start tapping tapping five to\nseven times now we don't need to tap so\nhard and you don't need to have so light\nlike you're tapping a melody you know a\nnice little tap but again reminding you\nthat some of it might be sensitive and\nthat's okay so you can release some of\nthe pressure if you're in that sensitive\npart so I'm going to start my counting\nmy anxiety right mind's eye my anxiety\nmy anxiety my anxiety my anxiety my\ninside my side\nmy name's I write remember I'm feeling\nmy anxiety of them tapping it's really\nimportant that's gonna help release it\nnow I'm going to focus on my issue again\ntake a deep breath and I'm gonna think\nabout that fight and I'm gonna write how\nintense\nmy name is i-80 is now maybe now down to\nthe thigh that's a thing what I could do\nthis more than one time our goal is so\nthen what I would do is ever repeat that\nwhole sequence right my name's ayat II\nmy name is I again and then I would test\nmyself at the end breath our goal is to\nget that number of intensity stay on to\naround two then we know we literally\nrelease the holding of that anxiety in\nour body so I would love you guys to if\nthose of you who have tried it I'd love\nyou to let me know in the comments how\nyou guys you know feel about this\ntechnique if you guys find it helpful\nwhen you use it if you've any other good\ntips to share with our community and\nthose of you who are trying it let me\nknow how it goes like I said this is\ngreat we can use this for daily stuff\nand we can also use this for a lot of\nthe deeper stuff follow-up video on the\ndeeper stuff later but give it a
