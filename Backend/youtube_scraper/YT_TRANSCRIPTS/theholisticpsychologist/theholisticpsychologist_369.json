    "transcript": "today I want to talk to you guys about\nunhealthy relationship Dynamics so\nthe way we are typically in our\nadulthood or really any time in\nrelationships has a lot to do with the\nrelationships the ex very earliest\nrelationships that we experience so\nthose in our caregiving environment why\nis that the case\nlike those of you who have followed me\nyou know I go on and on talking about\nthe sub\nall the narrative\nnatives that were in there so thinking\nabout it logically right however you\nthink that we get to this earth in this\nbody right we're here we're in a little\nbaby and really when we think about it\nour caregiving environments are our\nfirst experiences with relationships\nright in a couple ways we see\nrelationships happening right we have\ntwo caregivers maybe between the two of\nthem maybe there's some siblings\ninvolved aunts and uncles right so we're\nwe're observing relationships happening\nwe're also in the relationship right\nwe're I'm in relation with my caregiver\nmy siblings right so I get to experience\na almost the live experience really of\nbeing in a relationship\nso where does subconscious come in they\nset up Frameworks for how we understand\nrelationships and then we age and then\nwe you know we become social creatures\nin school and we have friendships and\nthen we start dating and we have\nromantic Partnerships and typically what\nhappens is we start to engage in those\nsimilar patterns that we got used to\nthose similar ways of being in a\nrelationship that again we've either\nobserved or experienced in our\ncaregiving environment so that's why I\nthink\nimportant to understand that these\ndynamics that might be causing this\nissue now come from that long ago place\nI want to the reason why I defined or I\ntitled this\nis redefining is because I think a lot\nof us if we think back to these early\nexperiences most of us are you know a\nlarge percentage of though it's not you\nknow as big we'll say you know I don't\nhave those big glaring traumas right I\nwasn't abused I wasn't neglected\nnothing's standing out it's being\nproblematic right but I think that it's\nimportant to consider all of the other\nways that again we learn ways of being a\nrelationship that aren't helpful to us\nnow in our adult worlds\num so it doesn't have to look like\ntrauma you know as we I think culturally\nor societally Define it it can look like\njust these negative patterns that\nserve us or aren't giving us the most\nfulfilling relationships that that we\ncould and should be having so the way I\nam now defining what an unhealthy\nDynamic is or I should say one of the\nthe driving factors of what an unhealthy\nDynamic is is\nlearn about\nand I particularly want to talk about\nthis because I get so many messages from\nyou guys you know who are aware of this\nconcept of boundaries and we'll kind of\nreadily admit I have problems with\nboundaries and I need help a lot of us\ndo and like I said they come from again\nthese very very early experiences that\nwe've observed and had in relationship\nwith others so what is a boundary to\nSimply put it simply a boundary is the\nfact that I am a you know an individual\nwho has my separate thoughts feelings\nwants need behaviors from someone else\nmeaning that I can have a say you know\nas to kind of my I can have opposing\nthoughts I can have opposing feelings\nfrom even my closest partner right and\nthat's okay a lot of us so the boundary\nbetween me and other is blurred meaning\nthat I tend to take on sometimes or\nrespond to someone else's thought\nfeelings one's desires behaviors\nseparate even when they go against my\nown so what are some signs that we might\nbe struggling with blurred boundaries\num a quick sign is if we if you start to\ncatch yourself if you pay attention to\nlanguage you use and again sometimes\nthis really does apply to our caregiving\nenvironments you'll hear a lot of weeds\nright so we the Joneses do this so we\nthe Joneses don't do that or even you\nmight use this with your partner right\ndefining your partnership as a we and\nthen presenting forward a share right\nwhether it's a shared belief or a shared\nBehavior or share promotion so the use\nof we can sometimes be a signal that the\nboundaries are a little more blurred\num another sign is when the achievements\nof one person right in the unit whether\nit's two-person unit or a family unit\num Can Define the group working then\nsometimes I forgot to\nt word in this\num so essentially what that means and\nagain I'm just going to use the\ncaregiving environment so I think that's\nprobably what a lot of us can relate to\nright so little Johnny success at school\nreflects positively on the parents right\nso do a great job because little Johnny\nsucceeding at school\non the other side of achievements of\ncourse is failures right so when Little\nJohnny's not doing so great the whole\nfamily is upset at Little Johnny because\nthey have the belief that that reflects\nright on the unit so it's a pretty\nsimple\num another sign is I worded it like this\nand over concern for the reaction to the\nno so essentially what that means simply\nis if I say no to something right I\ndon't know I don't want to come over or\nno I don't want to do this or don't want\nto do that I think um I don't agree with\nyou I'm so concerned about what the\nother person's reaction again whether\nthat's my partner or my family that that\nsometimes I might not say that right I\nmight just say the yes even though it's\nnot really what I want because I'm so\nafraid that the no will get anger or\nwithdrawal the person won't talk to me\nright or the person will overwhelm me\nwith why it is a yes you know\nso another sign\nwhen in when one individual's emotion so\nagain whether or not to die attitude\nperson unit or a family\nit kind of can uh affect whole group\nclimate so again using the family right\nwhen mom's having a bad day the whole\nfamily's having a baby\nthat's an example of that not a\nseparatist mom thought just having a bad\nday in her room right the whole family\nand those of us who've lived in or have\nfamily experiences like this can maybe\nrelate right the whole family is\nprobably not going to have a great day\nso again that's at lower boundaries one\nperson's emotions is affecting the whole\nunit another sign is there's no privacy\nthere's no autonomy again people tend to\ndo the same thing or people aren't\nspending time separately right there's\nnot shared interest right you're either\nyou're doing it with your partner or\nwith your family or not at all so again\nin in places or in relationships where\nthere is this blurred boundary you're\ngoing to see a lot of togetherness of\nthe sort so I drew this little picture\nbecause I think this illustrates kind of\nall of these things so again this is an\nexample of a unit\num again a family so maybe five\nindividuals that are kind of existing\ntogether right is this coherent whole\nsharing thoughts sharing feelings right\nbeliefs you'll have you'll hear a lot of\nthis like we believe in this or we don't\nbelieve in that and you better believe\neach of those people are going to share\nthat\num Behavior same thing right like I said\nearlier we do these things and we don't\ndo these things again if you're part of\nthis unit and you have these border\nboundaries you're likely adopting these\nshared beliefs thoughts\nand behavior so\na more ideal version of a relationship\nagain using the family example is here\nwe have five separate individuals right\nwith separate cells including separate\nthoughts separate feeling separate\nbeliefs and separate behaviors but still\nall existing in a unit okay so this is\nwhat we're striving for even if it's\njust a two-person right so it could\nequally look like this\nfor you know a romantic partnership with\ntwo separate individuals connected\ninstead of just two individuals right\nlocated together\nokay so now you might be wondering how\ndo we do this how do we start to form\nour separate cell how do we stop how do\nwe get out of this kind of group think\nmodel\num so the first thing we do is we get\ncurious you know if you're someone out\nthere who doesn't know\num or doesn't have hobbies or interests\nor maybe doesn't even know what you like\nand that's okay I was there I can share\npersonally I had some I for a while I\nhave a family who is very much like this\num and in in this system there's not\neven a shared interest of the unit so I\nspent a lot of time watching my friends\nat hobbies and things they like to do\nand actually\nlike and I had a really hard time\nfiguring that out so a great first step\nis to figure it out to start to spend\nsome time by yourself thinking what were\ninterested maybe you think back to\nChildhood so for me I really\nlove art like so love and paint I did it\nfor many years up until High School\nhonestly I got so far away from it and\nthat to me you know I started to to draw\nagain and I realized that is an interest\nof mine\nso sometimes go back think about what\nyou used to like that could help you to\nget curious and then Foster that meaning\ndo it buy yourself a kid go take a class\nstart to find the things that you like\nseparately from your unit whoever that\nmight be\nanother way to do this and again this\ngoes this connects this uh up to this\nkind of I have a hard time saying no\naspect of it protecting our energy so\nwhat I suggest is something that's\ncalled a resource check it meaning\nI take a moment right so if it's say my\nsister who always calls me and always\nneeds me you know for something usually\nfamily related this is true\num you know would always call me you\nneed to talk to me you need me to help\nme to solve the problem Etc right I had\na hard time telling her I couldn't say\nno\num so I would always see the phone pick\nup the phone call you know answer her\nand there's a lot of days where I just I\nI had nothing left I was having stress\nin my life I was tired or quite honestly\nI just didn't want to but I picked up\nthe phone a great technique is to do\nwhat I call a resource check-in meaning\ncheck in with yourself right if it's not\nthe day if you just had you know got\nyour if you just had a terrible day at\nwork or a fight with your partner and\nthat phone rings maybe now is not the\ntime for you to have the resource\nmeaning you hit send a voicemail right\nor you send a text that's easier hey you\nknow sister I gotta call you tomorrow\nagain it's okay and it's necessary\nespecially when we struggle with this\none to check\nourselves\nwe're not in a place to deal with\nthe person in our unit and that's okay\nso by doing that resource check-in by\nnot just habitually mindlessly picking\nup the phone because it rang that can go\na very very long way\nso another one is to practice being\nalone really as simple as that a lot of\nus do not spend a lot of time alone and\nmyself included I really had to teach\nmyself that Alum is okay that I actually\nlike alone now but I hear from a lot of\npeople that oh I would never do that\neating out because it was a huge one\nI'll never know never do this alone\nstart small right start with a small Act\nof self-care go take a bath alone right\ngo set yourself go take a walk alone go\ndo something nice for yourself alone\nbecause of how you're feeling this goes\na long way in teaching you how to care\nfor your own emotions right so you can\nbe this person over here who's having\nseparate emotions and it won't affect\nthe whole group and you can learn to\ncare for yourself as a separate\nemotional person\nbut you want to do something new that's\nanother easy thing right if you've never\ngone to eat alone go go out to eat go\nsit at the counter that makes you feel\nmore comfortable right go try if you\nwanted to say you were interested in\nknitting and no one in your world wants\nto knit go sign up for that knitting\nclass by yourself try things by yourself\nthis again even if it's just sitting in\na room meditating just carving out an\nhour for yourself separate from your\npartner separate from your family this\ncould really really go along\nI hope this was helpful\num explaining like I said what I think\ndrives a lot of the unhealthy dynamics\nthat we might be experiencing in our\ncurrent relationships I'd love to hear\nfrom you guys in the comments if you\nguys struggle with boundaries if you\nguys have any tips on boundaries please\nshare it below um and I would love to\nhear from you if you guys like this\nvideo please subscribe please hit the\nnotification to find out every time I\nput up a new video
