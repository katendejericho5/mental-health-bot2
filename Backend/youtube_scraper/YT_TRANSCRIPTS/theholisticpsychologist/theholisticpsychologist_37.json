    "transcript": "previously I talked about the freeze\nState what it is today I'm going to\nshare three ways to get out of freeze if\nyou haven't listened to that talk yet\nclick the link in my description to\ncheck it out now so these are techniques\nto help thaw or bring your body back\nfrom a free state going from mobilized\nor deactivated inactive to a more\nmobilized or activated state so each and\nevery time when you notice yourself in\nfreeze when you're feeling stuck like\nyou can't get up when you're feeling\nreally stuck in your head you're going\nto want to practice these three things\nand remember the more you practice the\nmore easily your body will be able to\nget Tha or to get unstuck now of course\nas you're practicing these you want to\nbe very gentle with yourself and not\ncriticize how it's going how you think\nit's going how you imagine it's going\nfor other people and begin to speak\nkindly the first thing you can do to get\nout of freeze is you can do circular\nmotions you want to start just with your\nwrist twirling them in a circle and then\nafter you do that for a few minutes you\ncan begin to move your arms in a circle\nmoving your body gently in these ways\nwill actually signal to your brain that\nit's safe to move these circular motions\nin particular will give your brain a\nsignal that you're not stuck and that\nyour energy and your movement can begin\nto be more fluid the second thing you\ncan do is you can color you can draw you\ncan just doodle when you're in Free\nState you get stuck in your head most of\nthe time what we're thinking about are\nworst case scenarios terrible things\nstressful things or we're shaming oursel\nfor not doing more so getting into a\nflow state with drawing with doodling\nwith doing anything creative helps you\nshift from your thinking mind to a more\nfocused State and this more focused\nstate in the present moment out of your\nmind will help signal to your body that\nthere's no threat present or that you're\nsafe which will help your body to leave\nthat free state the third thing you can\ndo is you can use your breath this one\nis extremely important because a lot of\nthe times when we're in a free state we\ndon't notice that we're tending to hold\nour breath or maybe we're just breathing\nreally shallow those type of breath\nholding our breath breathing shallow\nsignals to our body that we're stressed\nor that we're in danger so as we begin\nto pay more attention to our breath and\nuse our breath intentionally and that\ncan be as simple as putting a hand on\nyour lower belly as you inhale for maybe\nthree to five seconds feeling your belly\ninflate and then slowly exhaling for\nthat same 3 to five seconds doing that\nthree to five times for a minute or two\ntoo will again signal to your body that\nit's safer to relax will actually help\nrelax your body again helping you shift\nout of that freeze State now remember as\nyou're coming out of freeze you want to\ntake these steps slowly you don't want\nto overwhelm yourself or stress yourself\nout even more you don't even want to\ncreate a to-do list of doing all of\nthese three things at once you want to\nvery slowly begin these practices as you\nlearn now how to be present in a more\nactivated body because if you overwhelm\nor stress yourself out chances are you\nmight go right back into that habitual\nfreeze reaction so you want to take\nthose small steps you don't want to\ncriticize yourself along the way and you\nwant to honor the steps that you are\ntaking and the small shifts that you\nbegin to experience the more you do that\nthe less likely over time you will be to\ngo back into that freeze reaction I'd\nlove to hear from all of you you out\nthere in a free state yourself as you\nbegin these practices which one of them\nis the most helpful and what do you\nnotice as you begin your practice of\nthaing your body leave it in the\ncomments"
