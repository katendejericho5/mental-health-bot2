    "transcript": "this video is about how to connect with\nyour intuition so first I'm going to\ntalk about what intuition is and then\nhow to connect with it so intuition is\nessentially instinctive knowledge that\nis separate from your conscious thinking\nso again conscious thinking are\nliterally the thoughts that we have all\nday the truth of the matter is I know\nmyself included we spend far too much\ntime in our thinking mind so our\nthinking brain is something that you\nguys might have heard called the monkey\nmind\nit's literally like I said our mental\nchatter the voices that we are talking\nto our self with all day long whether or\nwe're of it or not so we have two major\ncategories that I've come up with one is\nthoughts of resistance so for me there\nthe I don't want to I don't want to be\nout of bed right now I don't want to get\noff the couch right now there are the\ntomorrow thoughts Oh tomorrow's a better\nday I'm tired I need to rest or the\nshowed this is a particular favor of\nmine what I should do which is often\ndifferent than what I want to do then we\nhave our pattern thoughts I call those\nour stories our narrative there are the\nones that are a little bit different\ndepending on who we are so some of us\nmight think on repeat I'm worthless or\nnobody likes me or everybody is against\nme this is again everyone is going to be\na little bit different in this category\nbut it's essentially if you tune in\nthose thoughts that you literally repeat\nyourself time and time again intuition\nis our inner knowledge it is our inner\nknowing or inner being\nit's that thing that's below kind of\nthose conscious thoughts so how do we\nconnect with those that is our mind-body\nconnection so when we're out of our\nthinking mind and we're literally\nconnected to our body that's when we can\nconnect with our intuition two huge\nimportant concepts that I'm always\ntalking about our presence and awareness\nwhen we're in the moment when we're\nin our mind to learn in our bodies\nthat's when we're going to be able to\nconnect with our intuition so how can we\ndo this three great practices those of\nyou who follow me probably see me doing\nbreath work breath work is essentially\npractice breathing when we are\npracticing our breathing and literally\npaying attention to the fact that we're\nbreathing we are connected to our bodies\nyoga stretching huge huge mindful\nactivities huge presence when we are\nliterally stretching our bodies so\ntouching your toes feeling your body\ntouch your toes not thinking about albus\nhurts literally feeling it in your body\nand yoga whoever takes a yoga class has\nprobably heard the instructions from the\ninstructor is always telling you connect\nwith your breath connect with your body\nhuge way to connect with that intuition\nand a third one is body scan essentially\nwhat body scan is it's a meditative\npractice where we literally can lay down\nand feel our bodies go down from our\nheads to our toes feeling where our\nbodies are tense so for me I always\ncarry tension up here in my shoulders so\nif I'm sitting here and I'm laying there\nand I'm focusing on my breathing I will\nactually feel that tension in my\nshoulders\npracticing either of these three\nactivities can be so helpful get us\nconnected to our bodies get is connected\nto our intuition and practice getting\nout of our thinking minds"
