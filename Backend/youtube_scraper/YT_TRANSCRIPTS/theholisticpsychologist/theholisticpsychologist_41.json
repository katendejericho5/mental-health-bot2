    "transcript": "do you regularly sit scrolling for hours\non your couch or do you think about\ntaking a shower but feel like your body\njust can't move to get there or maybe\nyou procrastinate even with things that\nyou want to get done for hours at a time\nthis is what it's like to be in a freeze\nState you've probably heard about fight\nor flight but freeze is actually a\nlesser known less talked about State\nthat's actually really common when our\nnervous system senses overwhelming\nstress\nit responds as if we're threatened or as\nif we're in danger and a lot of the\ntimes it ends up putting us in a\nshutdown state to cope with what's going\non around us I know for me I've spent a\nlot of time in a free state being\nconsistently overwhelmed with stress and\nunderresourced or not being able to deal\nwith it I ended up feeling overwhelmed\nand shut down or Frozen a lot of the\ntime imagine this is the case for a lot\nof you too so now I'm going to talk\nabout what it looks like to go into\nfreeze mentally when we're in freeze we\nend up feeling dissociated or really\nsimply disconnected it's almost like\nwe're here but we're not really here for\nme it felt like I was kind of hovering\nabove myself in what I call a\nspaceship another sign mentally is it\nfeels like we're losing chunks of time\nand sometimes we can't remember or\nrecall what we did maybe that day maybe\na couple weeks ago maybe a couple years\nago I know for me I really lack this\nability to recall even simple moments in\nmy daily life another sign mentally that\nyou're going to freeze is you find\nyourself wanting to do something simple\nlike taking a shower brushing your teeth\nbut you actually feel like you're locked\nin place like you lack motivation to\neven get up and do the thing physically\nwhen we go into freeze we can look like\nwe're slouched over or hunched our\nbody's actually turning inward to\nprotect oursel to protect our vulnerable\nheart space and then our posture begins\nto slump forward kind of mimicking that\nprotection physically we also end up\nfeeling really tired or lethargic and\nthis is actually our body's way of\nconserving energy for our survival it\nbelieves that we are in a life or death\nsituation\nso what little energy we have is going\nto keeping us surviving meaning we don't\nhave then the energy to motivate to get\nup to do the things that we want to do\nin our\nrelationships freeze can look like\nfeeling isolated or just distance from\npeople even when we're in the same room\nas them or even when we're in a\nrelationship with them in relationships\nit can also look like kind of feeling a\nstate of confliction on the one hand we\nwant to connect but but on the other\nhand we don't we're almost at odds\nwithin\nourself relationally freeze looks like\nshutting down really easily again\nbecoming completely overwhelmed\nespecially in conflict and it often\nmakes it difficult for us to express\nourselves to share what it is that we're\nthinking what it is that we're feeling\nbecause we just shut down so easily now\na lot of people take these symptoms of\nfreeze to mean that or begin to think\nthat we're lazy or that we're\nprocrastinating or that maybe we're\nunmotivated or maybe that all the things\nthat we want to do aren't meant for us\nwhen really these are all signs that our\nbody is in a free state that our nervous\nsystem is trying to protect us thinking\nthat it's doing the best it can to keep\nus safe now I imagine a lot of you might\nbe listening thinking wow this sounds a\nlot like me and I want you to know that\nyou are not alone I spent Decades of my\nlife locked in this free state and the\ngood news is that we can always begin\nright now to make small choices to bring\nour body out of freeze or to do what I\ncall thaw our B's response become more\nconnected to what's going on inside of\nus so stay tuned because next week we're\ngoing to dive into some actual practices\nand tools that you can begin to use\nright now to help yourself thaw from\nthis freeze response for those of you\nlistening who are in a freeze state or\nexperience freeze States drop me a\ncomment I'd love to hear what it looks\nlike for you"
