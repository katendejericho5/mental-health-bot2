    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about\ndevelopmental trauma we're going to\nexplore what it is how it develops and\nat the end I'm going to share some signs\nso that you can determine whether or not\nyou might be struggling so first what is\ndevelopmental trauma when we're born our\nbrain and our bodies are developing\nbased on how we're cared for by the\ncaretakers around us and how connected\nwe feel scientifically we say that our\nbrain develops from the bottom up or\nsimply what that means is the lower part\nof our brain is actually driven or\ngeared for survival we can call this our\nsurvival brain it helps keep us safe and\nhelps us respond to stress or danger\nwhen it's present now the upper part of\nour brain is in charge of what we call\nexecutive functions or really simply\nhelps us make decisions be creative and\nunderstand or make sense of the world\naround us it's less focused on survival\nand those more impulsive instinctual\nemotions so what does this mean for us\nthis means that if we grow up in an\nenvironment where our nervous systems\nfight ORF flight response is constantly\nactivated our brain development is\nimpacted specifically that upper region\ndoesn't have the opportunity to fully\ndevelop so you might be asking yourself\nwhat are some things that disrupt our\nbrain development some things that\ndisrupt our brain development are having\na parent who abuses substances that\nunpredictable behavior that goes goes\nalong with substance use can create a\nlack of safety for ourselves it is also\nimpacted by having a parent who's\nregularly checked out maybe they're not\nphysically present maybe they're not\nemotionally present maybe they give you\nthe silent treatment on a regular\nbasis our brain development is disrupted\non the other side of that maybe we have\na parent who's emotionally abusive\nshaming maybe they're really strict or\nthey're highly invasive always\noverstepping our boundaries our brain\ndevelopment can be impacted by being\nparentified or simply by needing to\nbecome maybe the parent to our parent\nmaybe the parent to our sibling or\ntaking on mature developmental\nresponsibilities that are beyond our\ndevelopmental age and finally having\ninconsistent or chaotic paring never\nknowing what type of parent will show up\nwhether they'll be happy whether they'll\nbe sad will it'll be exploding when we\ndon't have that predictability again we\nfeel unsafe\nand our brain development is impacted\nnow a lot of times a lot of people a lot\nof myself included who struggle in those\nways we end up with different\ndiagnosises whether it's bipolar\ndisorder or maybe it's reactive\nattachment disorder generalized anxiety\nsocial anxiety or maybe a number of\npersonality disorders in reality in my\nopinion all of these disorders are\nactually symptoms that come from a lack\nof Safety and Security and ATT tune tent\nthat we need it in our\nchildhood people who have\ndevelopmentally healthy experiences\nlet's talk about the opposite side of\nDevelopmental trauma have experiences\nwith parents who are naturally able to\nattune to their needs to their feelings\nare able to sense and anticipate and\nmeet our needs it helps us to have\nparents who then regularly repair or\napologize when there's disconnection\nwhen something hurtful happens within\nthe relationship when we grow up with\nadults who are safe and trustworthy we\nend up being better able to cope with\nstress ourselves we can tolerate\ndiscomfort disappointment we can trust\npeople and we have a general feeling\nthat that we belong that we're enough as\nwe are when we experience developmental\ntrauma and we grow up in homes with\ndisconnected caregivers or unsafe adults\nwe end up struggling with trust with\ncommitment and with emotional regulation\nand we often end up acting impulsively\nall of this is because of the\nmisattunement that we experience in our\nchildhood misattunement is when we grow\nup with adults who aren't able to soothe\nor notice when we're upset who don't ask\nor notice when we're having an emotional\nexperience or who regularly ignore your\nneeds now of course misattunement\ndoesn't necessarily mean that we had bad\nparents it typically means that we had\nparents who might have experienced\ndevelopmental trauma themselves and who\ndon't therefore have the skills or the\nawareness to connect with us in the ways\nthat we need it now remember for all of\nyou parents out there listening all\nparents will be misat tuned some of the\ntime it is impossible to put an\nexpectation on yourself as a parent or\nin care of anyone in your life that you\ncan meet the needs or anticipate the\nneeds of someone else all of the time\nperfectly so keep in mind that\ndevelopmental trauma occurs CS when this\nmisattunement happens more often than it\ndoesn't happen when it's a consistent\nexperience of misattunement over an\nextended period of time so now I'm going\nto share some signs so you can identify\nyourself if you might be struggling with\ndevelopmental trauma which is really\ncommon I've experienced myself and I\nwant you to know that there is so much\nhealing and so much hope possible as we\nbecome aware of these signs so as I go\nthrough these take a moment to think\nabout yourself to think about your\nexperience and to see which appli to you\nthe first sign is you often feel unsafe\nhighly anxious or on edge around other\npeople you just have this sense or this\nfeeling or even a worry that people will\nhurt you or that they'll betray you or\nthat they're not trustworthy in some way\na second sign is you don't really know\nhow you feel and I know I resonate with\nthis one a lot there are are so many\ntimes where I need time a few moments\nbecause I don't know exactly what I'm\nfeeling and I have a really difficult\ntime expressing it third sign is you\noften struggle with emotional regulation\nyou might find yourself immediately\nshutting down or maybe becoming\nemotionally reactive exploding in anger\nor upset often times your emotional\nreaction doesn't match the event itself\nand because of this we end up feeling\nlike we're on a daily roller coaster\nlike our emotions are controlling us are\ndriving our behaviors and a lot of times\nwe end up feeling really out of control\nand helpless like things are happening\nto us and we can't help how we feel or\nhow we\nreact the fourth sign is you don't\nunderstand your own needs now this is a\nreally big one because developmental\ntrauma begins when we didn't have an\nadult to attune to or to anticipate to\nhelp us understand what we needed so\nwhen we don't have that in childhood we\nend up struggling ourself to attune to\nor to discover what it is that we need\nnow this can be as basic as finding\noursel right running around exhausting\noursel even when we don't have the\nenergy not even knowing that we don't\nhave the energy that we're actually\nexhausted or maybe we're not eating in\nmoments where we're really hungry we're\nnot even aware of how hungry we are or\nwe might find oursel in our\nrelationships holding things in to the\npoint that they end up exploding\nsomewhere down the line because\nbasically when we're not connected to\nourselves we're going to struggle to\nattune to or to understand our own needs\nand then as an extension we're probably\ngoing to struggle to meet those needs or\nto ask for the support when we need it\nthe fifth sign of Developmental trauma\nis you find yourself struggling or\nhaving discomfort around vulnerability\nnow of course this makes a lot of sense\nbecause in childhood you're emotions\nwere probably invalidated all the times\nyou were told not to cry or to stop\ncrying or maybe you were sent to your\nroom when you were upset or maybe you\nlike me had a family that just ignored\nmajor major issues didn't talk about\nthem swept them under the rug and\nstruggle wasn't talked about so if in\nchildhood right emotions vulnerability\nwasn't shared or modeled it is then\nnatural that you're probably going to\nstruggle feeling comfortable being open\naddressing issues you might end up\nfinding yourself avoiding ing issues or\nconflict entirely or maybe even being\nafraid of it so those are some signs\nthat you might be experiencing\ndevelopmental trauma take some time and\nreflect and I want you to know that\ndevelopmental trauma again is something\nthat can be healed as we become aware of\nthese patterns and begin to create\nchange speaking of Developmental trauma\nthe past several months in self-healer\ncircle my private Global membership\nCommunity we've been been exploring\ndevelopmental trauma and this month we\nare so honored to be inviting in Dr\nPeter LaVine the creator of sematic\nexperiencing and a Pioneer in trauma\nunderstanding awareness and healing for\nthose of you who are interested in more\ninformation on self-healer Circle\nmembership and how to gain access to\nthis Workshop click the link below and\nof course I'd love to hear from the rest\nof you in the comments if you resonate\nwith developmental trauma\nwhat are the different ways you've\nnoticed your life has been impacted"
