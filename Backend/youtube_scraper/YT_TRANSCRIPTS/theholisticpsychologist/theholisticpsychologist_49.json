    "transcript": "I'm joined here today with Lisa Bilu\nauthor of radical confidence she's here\nto have a chat about the newest chapter\nin the re-release of this book on toxic\nrelationships we dive into all things\ntoxic relationships what they look like\nLisa shares her own personal journey of\nbeing in leaving and healing from a\ntoxic relationship you're not going to\nwant to miss this conversation stay\ntuned so thank you again Lisa for coming\nback and having another chat I know just\na bit ago actually it was probably\nlonger than and I even remember now um\nwhen your first book radical confidence\ncame out what a gift to the world I know\nso many in my community resonated with\nour conversation I imagine grabbed your\nbook I think confidence is one of those\nareas that many of us struggle with and\nso when you reached out and let me know\nthat not only is a new print coming out\nthough a new chapter has been added\nspecifically on the topic of toxic\nrelationships I knew I wanted to get you\non have another conversation and to dive\ninto to All Things relational toxic\nrelationship of course the impact that\nit has on confidence so thank you for\nhaving this chat with me here today oh\nmy God absolute honor my homie I love\nyou I love what you stand for what you\ndo for your community and so honestly\nthis is truly my honor so let's get\nstarted um what inspired as you were you\nknow offered to to write a new chapter\nor maybe even thought to write a new\nchapter um why is it that toxic Rel\nrelationships I guess came to mind what\nis the inspiration for this new\naddition yeah it really came from\nassessing what are all the things that\nwe struggle with and what gets in our\nway and when I started to think about\nhow you know our mindset the way that we\nthink actually holds us back from our\ngoals um and failure things like that\nare all very real that can really Dent\nour confidence but the thing that I just\nkeep coming back to when I listen to\npeople is that if you're in a\nrelationship that isn't healthy it can\nliterally erode your confidence to the\npoint where you don't even know who you\nare anymore and when I look at all the\nthings that we struggle with that's the\none thing that can really erode your\nconfidence or actually uplift your\nconfidence if you're in a healthy\nrelationship and so I almost realized\nthat in my book and my story the big\nthing that was missing was talking about\nmy toxic boyfriend before I met Tom\nbecause that was the moment where when I\nwas young I was insecure cure and I was\nin a relationship that made me feel less\nthan I wasn't able to build my\nconfidence back and it wasn't until I'd\nmet Tom who led a fire under my\nconfidence who elevated me that I\nrealized that one decision of being with\nsomebody or not with somebody can Dent\nyour confidence potentially for the rest\nof your life I appreciate you you\nsharing that Lisa because I think for a\nlot of us it is the experience of almost\nlike a retrospective right when we have\na different relational experience one\nthat's less toxic that then gives us\nthat opportunity to kind of look back\nand to Define I think more accurately\nwhat it was because for a lot of us at\nleast I mean some of us might have you\nknow very well-intentioned friends or\nloved ones kind of waving from the\nsidelines trying to tell us how toxic\nthey view our relationship to be though\nwhen it's us in the relationship\nespecially if that's the only type of\nrelationship that we have ever known\nwhich for a lot of us again begins in\nchildhood we don't it's almost as if we\nhave blinders on and so I appreciate how\nthroughout the book you you you talk so\nhonestly and shared so much of your\nexperience so in particular you sharing\nso honestly around this particular\nrelationship I I just know it's going to\nbe so healing because I think these are\nthe moments that we we keep close to\nHeart many of us because we feel\nshameful and I just want to read a quote\nbecause I was love quotes as you know\nand you write um and I think this was\nactually maybe verbatim something that\nthis this previous boyfriend had shared\nwith you and imagining many of my\ncommunity and listeners might have heard\nsomething similar you write how he had\nsaid some version of you're never going\nto find anyone who loves you as much as\nI do and then you go on to say kind of\nyour own process you can see now how you\nwere trapped in a textbook toxic\nrelationship one that poisoned my\nunderstanding of who I was how I saw\nmyself what I deserved and how I saw the\nworld as a whole\nso I just want to you know kind of dive\nin there in terms of especially that\nstatement because I know a lot of us\nprobably heard some version of being\ntold by a toxic partner right all of the\nreasons why we shouldn't or can't leave\num so if you can kind of share a little\nbit about of those early moments and of\ncourse the shift and understanding that\nthen happened where you were able to see\nthough that moment and see him in that\nrelationship a bit more\nclearly yeah um I love actually how you\nbroke it down and um you know the key\nwith you know with the blinders it's\nlike you have these blinders especially\nif it's your first love especially when\nyou're L young the thing that I would\nadd to that is especially when you're\ninsecure especially when you have\nself-doubt because that becomes the um\nthe concoction if you will to the the\nbomb that ends up happening and so here\nI was I've been bullied as a child I\ndidn't feel good about myself I was very\ninsecure I never got a boyfriend and so\nAlong Comes this guy who told me he\nloved me who sometimes was very sweet\nwas very kind and other times he was\nvery mean and very cruel and very\nverbally abusive and so it was just\nenough of the combination to keep me\nwhere I was and every time I thought I\nhad the strength or the ability to\nrecognize that it was a dysfunctional\nrelationship and it was time to get out\nhe would use ver uh verbage that would\nhe knew would trigger me so if you're\nsomeone that never felt loved that never\nfelt admired and then they turn around\nand says no one's ever going to love you\nas much as I do you take that as truth\nbecause I think one thing that we um if\nyou have a sweet and kind heart you\nthink that what someone says is true\nbecause if you were to say it it is true\nand so you take that on as unfortunately\ntruth so when he said that to me that\nfear of oh my God I don't want to be\nalone what if I never find anybody he\ndoes say that he loves me and at times\nhe does show that he loves me so maybe\nbetter the devil you know and I then\nended up staying there out of fear that\nI'd be alone forever that I'd never be\nloved and that becomes that toxic cycle\nwhere they know exactly how to trigger\nyou because they understand your\nvulnerabilities and to your point that\nyou said right at the beginning that\nbecomes the Trap you don't know any\nbetter because you don't have anything\nto compare it to or you actually have it\nto compare to is how you felt when you\nwere by yourself now when I was by\nmyself I didn't like myself I thought\nmore highly of myself when I was in a\nrelationship even though they were toxic\nbecause at least I could say to myself\nthat Lisa at least someone loves you\nright and I was really struck when you\nwere sharing um kind of the relational\nwhat I would call your relational\ninsecurity and kind of describing you\nand interacting right with these you\nknow group and you know group of boys in\nparticular who never really saw you\nright as as being kind of quote unquote\ngirlfriend material and you were really\nspeaking to so much of of my early\nchildhood and I remember very similar to\nyou right with the soccer shorts on I\njust want to like play sports with the\nboys and as I started to see other\ngirlfriends I had at that time at the\nsame age you know kind of shifting their\nrelationship with boys into more\nromantic ones into being desired and you\nknow I I didn't look in a way that I\nthought was attractive and I didn't like\nthe way I looked in particular I didn't\nlike the way I was I felt very shy very\ntimid so of course like you and I love\nthe language you use you quote I was\ndying from constantly feeling unwanted\nso right going with this insecurity I\nthink it's really natural we look\noutside of ours for\nconfirmation that we're want it that we\nbelong I mean for me in my opinion this\nbegins in our earliest relationships\nwithin our parents right and then that\njust transfers to our peers right do I\nbelong in this peer group do I belong\nwith this partner and so somewhere down\nthe line if and when someone shows any\nversion of interest in us right then we\nget that confirmation that we've been\nlonging for which I do agree kind of for\na lot of us and sends us into this trap\nbut I appreciate kind of you describing\nthe Deep rooted insecurity that a lot of\nus are carrying in which then makes it\ntempting to stay especially with this\ninconsistent messaging that many of us\nget hot and cold always then see\nspeaking right the little crumb\nbreadcrumbing I think is another\nlanguage that some of us use kind of\nwhatever it is that you give me that\njust\nconfirms that you're here and that I\nwant it and then that will for a lot of\nus as you beautifully describe keep us\nright locked in these Cycles so how then\nif we kind of want to talk about\ninsecurity within the relationship now\nthese toxic Dynamics um what it is it\nthat began to happen like in the course\nof your Dynamic I know you you described\na kind of a statement or a a concept of\nmaking yourself smaller and smaller so\ncan you kind of talk to us before of\ncourse you came to the realization and\nempowered yourself to to shift and\nchange the dynamic what was the\ntrajectory like once you were within it\nfeeling insecure trying to kind of\naccommodate this other\nperson yeah I think that there's two big\nthings here that I had to look at and\nown that these were the things that I\ntied my self-esteem to it was my\nidentity and then my validation that\ncame from my identity and before I had\nmet this guy I felt my identity was a\nloser who no one loved no one admired no\ngood I was put in a special class for\nbeing mildly dyslexic and so I just all\nalong the way the messaging that I got\nwas well that I wasn't great at anything\nand so the identity when I met someone\nis oh my God I'm lovable\nso that identity I had adopted and then\nwithin that identity I was seeking the\nvalidation that I was lovable so every\nact that he would do that confirmed my\nvalidation I'd be like oh see he does\nlove me see I feel good about myself I\nam lovable and that cycle is the thing\nthat I was searching for because I was\ninsecure and so any time he would do\nsomething that was quote unquote bad\nverbally abusive or anything I took that\non as okay in order for me to be\nvalidated I shouldn't do it so let me\njust mold myself slowly into the thing\nthat he needs so that I can feel the\nvalidation in my identity that I'm\nlovable and that came from myself it\ncame from my own insecurities and that\nwas the Trap itself obviously we can\ntalk about how I then got out of it but\nI think I had to look at what's my\nidentity wrapped around this\nrelationship and then where am I seeking\nvalidation in my book I call valid like\nvalidation is for parking because we\nlook for validation elsewhere and it\nbecomes the Velvet handcuffs because in\nthat moment the validation actually\nfeels good and that's part of the trick\nright the handcuffs may be gold they may\nbe cushioned they may feel soft but\nthey're still freaking handcuffs and so\nthat's kind of how I felt with the\nvalidation piece that in the moment it\nfeels really good but the truth is it's\njust there to keep me trapped I love how\nyou're bringing up identity\nbecause you even go to speak of and I\nthink this is going to speak to a lot of\nlisteners how in a lot of these\nrelationships we we lose or maybe we've\nnever known who we are right so then\nthis perfect storm occurs right where if\nI'm only defining who I am my\nlovableness or my worthiness right\nwhatever it is based on someone else\nthen it's really a natural question to\nfollow and then even concern and fear I\ncould say to consider well then who\nmight I be without this defining\nidentity and I think you know again when\nwe put so much on another to receive\nvalidation to Define who we are it's\nreally natural so I just wanted to kind\nof speak to the the listeners because I\nknow especially as we get up in in age\nif you will to question and to wonder\nwho we are for a lot of us the fear of\nnot knowing the shame of not knowing the\nwondering of what it will be like to not\nhave that\nvalidation is more than enough to keep\nme in these toxic patterns because the\nfear is too great and I you go into and\nI I said one of the the kind of concepts\nof breadcrumbing earlier but you you\nkind of cover within these relationships\nsome Dynamics you talk about\nmanipulation and gaslighting and\nghosting and codependency and love\nbobbing and breadcrumbing so if you you\ncan give us kind of any for any listener\nwho again might have these blinders on\nright might not get might be getting all\nof their validation right not even being\nable to consider who they were might not\neven have this sort of language for\nthese dysfunctional or tox toxic\ndynamics that are impacting confidence\ncan you kind of give us a little bit of\nkind of what that could look like um so\nthat maybe some of us can see in our own\nDynamic that that is actually what is\nhappening yeah so I'm going to steal\nfrom an incredible woman called Dr nicoa\nPera and she's the person that taught me\nto start listening to the body to start\nlistening to your insides what is that\ntelling you because the second you\nnotice the discomfort is the moment that\nit's telling you something's wrong and\nwhat I did is I just tried to ignore my\ndiscomfort I ignored what my body was\nscreaming to me I ignored all the red\nflags because I was so seeking to feel\nvalidated and that one moment that like\nhit of dopamine well I just feel good\nabout myself that I just would keep\nignoring all the signs and so I think\nthe very first thing that we you know\nshould identify is does it feel\nuncomfortable if it does you need to\nstart to go down that path and ask\nyourself why and I never did that I was\ntrying to convince myself or tell myself\nthat my body doesn't know the thing that\nthe TVs the movies right Society tells\nyou is you find a guy that is going to\nlove you that is you know and that's the\nend of the story and the truth is you\nneed to take those blinders off that you\nsaid earlier so once you take those\nblinders off you have to embrace it's\nnot going to be easy it's going to be\nreally freaking difficult but what life\ndo you want actually ask yourself do you\nwant a relationship that fills you up or\nsucks you dry it becomes that simple\nwhen you step back now how you do it\nobviously very complicated but that\nbecomes the decision that I never wanted\nto ask\nmyself and once once I actually had the\nanswer that I want to live a life of\nabundance someone that freaking lifts me\nup it became clear the person I was with\ndoesn't do\nthat and so I think understanding that\nand then also writing your values\nwriting what you care about write out\nyour morals who are you fundamentally\nand then the person that's with you do\nthey match your values and your morals\ninstead of you shaping yourself to them\nhow can you make sure that you stand\nfirm in what you care about and then\nthat will give you almost like a guiding\npost of okay this is who I am this is\nwhat I care about this is what I value\nthese are my morals does a person with\nme match those if the answer is no now\nyou can start to kind of go deep and\nlisten to yourself and think okay is\nthis relationship right for me I think\nit's so beautiful is this message of\nempowerment right which which is that we\ndo have the this inner knowing whether\nor not we're paying attention to it of\ncourse that's another conversation\nentirely though there are instincts\nright there is feelings that are\nhappening and so the goal being of\ncourse for anyone listening to begin to\npay attention to what those are right\nbecause there's value there that's\nimportant and I there's so much I think\na lot of us overstep especially when\nthere's insecurity when we're just\nseeking to be loved and we'll take\nanything and anyway I think a lot of us\nwhen relationships are beginning meaning\nwhen we're meeting someone getting to\nknow them we overstep\nwe we we delete even the very important\nfoundational piece of relationship\ndevelopment which is having these\nconversations whether it's with ourself\nin terms of exploring what my values are\nwhat do I want in a relationship as\nsimply as that is what do I value right\nwhat are my morals what is what is\nimportant for me in my future and what I\nmean when I say we delete that is those\nof us that are insecure to seeking to be\npicked if you will that doesn't matter\nbecause all that matters right because\nwe need that\nvalidation is the fact that they want to\nsee more of us whether or not we want to\nsee or build even a future right with\nthis person so for a lot of us and I\nimagine listeners might even be well\ninto relationships it's not too late to\nhave these kind of points of pause and\nto take the time and to curiously then\nexplore these deeper questions about\nourself in terms of values and what we\nwant and then being able to then ask the\nquestion in terms of how does this align\nwith the person in front front of me\nwhether I'm just getting to know them\nand I can maybe explore and directly ask\nthese questions because they're\nimportant or whether I know them already\nand I can explore you know a new context\nof the relationship by bringing maybe up\nthis topic that has been avoided and so\nI think that's such an important just\npractical component of a relationship\nthat I think a lot of us\nwe are so focused on what someone else\nthinks that we don't take these moments\nto understand that we are part of the\nrelationship you know kind of Creation\nin and of itself and I want to go into\ntwo because you talk about and I think\nit's really can I just add one thing\nsorry if you don't mind can I just add\none thing to what you just said um which\nI freaking love because this is the\nproblem it slowly happens over time it's\nnever just you meet someone they're\nverbally abusive and now you're in it\nit's like the analogy that really hit me\nis you know the water that drops on the\nrock over time and water is soft water\ncan be like it can replenish you water\ncan be wonderful but if it's just\nconsistently dripping what happens to\nthat rock it changes its shape now think\nabout that as a human if someone's\ndripping on you over time it's not loud\nit's not abrupt it's not abusive it's\njust slowly slowly before you know it\nthat's where people turn around go I\ndon't know who I am anymore you didn't\nblink it just happened slowly over time\nand that becomes the trap in and of\nitself yes absolutely I appreciate um\nyou acknowledging because it isn't for a\nlot of us just so evident right so clear\nfrom the beginning it is this kind of\ngradual morphing where many of us end up\nmorphing away from oursel entirely and\nyou discuss um I think it's really\nunique and interesting and empowering\nhow you bring up the concept and I'm\nsure you know listeners have heard of\nred flags right so what to look for in\nterms of a red flag in someone else but\nyou very interesting interestingly in my\nopinion Lisa add another component of it\nwhich is kind of what are red flags we\neven within our own behavior Within\nThese toxic relationships that we can\nidentify so can you say a little bit\nabout kind of red flag and these kind of\ntwo different versions because again I\nthink it's instinctually we always think\nof oh well what is the red flag and what\nsomeone else is doing but there's so\nmuch I think value in even looking at\npossible red flags and what we're doing\nin the context of these\nrelationships yeah thank you but so you\nknow I'm all about growth and so I set a\ngoal and I just say how do I actually\nget to my goal and what's in the way of\nyou know of me getting there and the\ntruth is when you're looking for a\nreally healthy beautiful relationship to\nlast you know hopefully in Forever you\nhave to look at what's your part in it\nbecause if we all believe that a\nrelationship is two ways if we believe\nthat a relationship should be 50 and uh\n50% uh 50 and 50 just looking at the\nother person actually doesn't help me to\nget to my goal and that's the truth I\ndon't want to look at everything that\nI've done wrong I don't want to\nacknowledge the things that I've done\nwrong because they suck but the truth is\nI can't get better I can't improve I\ncan't get to that perfect relationship\nthat I'm seeking if I don't actually\nlook at my own participation in what\nwent wrong in the relationship and so\nyou can never ever as if we could Nicole\nI would do it but you can't control\nother people you can't force them to do\nwhat you want them to do and so I just\ngo I can't I can't force him I can't\nforce my ex to be behave in a certain\nway I can't force my husband to behave\nin a certain way but you better believe\nwhat I can do is take ownership not\nblame ownership over how I showed up in\nthat relationship that's how I'm going\nto get to my goal because then I can\nimprove I can evolve I can change and so\nto your point is that my ex had a lot of\nred flags and instead of leaving which\nat that moment I had the choice actually\nI want to make sure can I just cave you\nI'm not talking about physical abuse\nwhen it comes to danger of physical\nabuse it isn't as easy just to leave so\nI want to make sure that I'm very clear\nthere but when it comes to verbal abuse\nin the relationship that I was in I\ncould have left I could have left when I\nsaw the red flags when he was calling me\nnames when he was pinching my thigh and\ncalling me fat like I could have left\nbut I didn't what I chose to do was be\ntoxic back now it became a defensive\nmechanism it's not like I wanted to be\ntoxic it's not like it was conscious\nthing but when I look back in hindsight\nI just go why didn't I leave oh because\nI use this mechanism as a way to\nmaintain the status quo of our\nrelationship I didn't want to break I\ndon't want to fall apart so the only way\nnot to break and fall apart is give as\ngood as I got and that's the truth so\nnow I go I never want to be that person\nagain that wasn't a good look that\ndidn't make me feel good that isn't the\nhuman I want to be so how do I make sure\nI never get there again well let me put\nup my own Flags let me identify where\nalong the timeline I started to become\ntoxic back and make sure that I don't do\nthat again and so it really was when\nsomeone's Abus when someone's demeaning\nyou I now will walk away or the words I\nwill say is please do not disrespect me\nlike I've come up with a game plan so\nthat if someone does I'm not toxic back\nthat I've got a mechanism and a toolit\nif you will that I can use so that I\ndon't slip back into old habits and so\nthat's kind of my game plan is what am I\ngoing to say back do I walk away do I\nforgive them do I accept it right and I\ngot this game plan so I never ever get\ntrapped again in becoming a toxic person\nthat I\nabsolutely um I don't respect I don't\nrespect myself when I'm like that and\nyou know going back to the validation\nthing the thing that I validate myself\non is doing the hard thing always\nrespect to myself even when it's not\neasy I appreciate you so honestly\nspeaking to that because I can you know\neven just speaking my own past\nrelationship experience the many moments\nwhere I met similar even toxicity you\nknow I had a very similar sounding\nrelation ship with a past partner who\nwas very verbally and emotionally\nabusive even in front of other people\nwould call me a dumbass amongst many\nother things and you know in moments\nespecially when I felt you know\nthreatened destabilized by this you know\nvery understandable reaction to very you\nknow dysfunctional toxic even abusive\nBehavior instead of right taking a\ngrounded approach or the you know\nempowered approach to identify what it\nwas and to create the boundary I needed\nand leave I just went head-to-head\nand this is I think what a lot of us\nthen find oursel in Cycles with within\nour relationship because you you write\nit so beautifully when you're saying\ndating someone makes you toxic and you\nsince learned that your behavior which\nhaunted me for a long time because I\nfelt so ashamed also sinking that low\nthis is a incredibly important part here\nwas actually a natural response to\nfeeling powerless in a relationship\nright when we are destabilized when\nwe're feeling threatened even going back\nfull circle right when we feel like this\nperson is our identity our only sense of\nbelonging and\nworthiness of course then it's natural\nfor many of us then to sink or to find\noursel going right in to whether it's a\ncombative right kind of toxic cycle a\ndisconnected toxic cycle right where\nwe're leaving or ghosting the person or\nwhatever it is it's only natural because\nwe too are feeling threatened trying to\nregain a sense of stability and of\ncontrol and for a lot of us it means so\nI I appreciate your your bravery and I\nthink it's very difficult for many of us\nto kind of acknowledge those moments and\nto do so as you beautifully did in a non\nshameful way because it is whether we're\nin a moment right now right where we're\nfeeling like we aggressively have to\ndefend oursel by saying and doing\nhurtful things it's coming from a very\nunderstandable place a very\nunderstandable anger a very\nunderstandable resentment\nand for some of us the only way that we\ncan try to regain some sense of grounded\nstability or control that we need can I\nask you a question what is actually then\nhappening to our body and brains when\nthat happens because it's weird I used\nto run away from the shame right it's\nlike don't admit it it's so shameful\nlock it in a box and never let it see\nthe light of day but actually the very\ntrue thing is every time I voice my\nshame and I give myself Grace I I feel\nso good about myself so what is actually\nhappening then because I want to\nencourage people to actually just own\nthe shame not hide because it does feel\nbetter once you voice it but in that\nmoment it doesn't actually feel better\nor you don't think it's going to feel\nbetter absolutely I think shame is one\nof the most core and for a long time\nit's funny and I appreciate this\nconversation going here Lisa because for\ndecades you would have not ever heard me\nacknowledge shame in my life it just one\nof those feelings I didn't think I felt\nshameful there was naturally things that\nI was very good at from an early age I\nfelt very proud of those things I was\nvery Savvy to avoid right showing myself\nin any unsavory light so in my opinion I\ndidn't have much to be shameful of not\nto realize how in my case and I think in\na lot of our cases shame has become so\nmuch of who we think we are again based\nin our earliest experiences our earliest\nrelationships where we didn't get the\nvalidation of just being enough for\nbeing who we are regardless of how it\nwas we were expressing ourselves and so\nwe kind of develop this kernel of a\nbelief that we're unworthy in some way\nand then because we are very attentive\nattuned and Savvy creatures all of us\neven in our childhood we modify\nourselves right and we be we we show up\nin ways that keep that shame at Bay so\nthe reality of it is we don't know how\nto in my opinion the large majority of\nus be with the large majority of our\nemotions let alone shame and why would\nwould we\nexpose our flaw our imperfection why\nwould we expose to someone else that\nwhich makes us unworthy because\nsomewhere along the line many of us have\nlearned that those shameful aspects of\nour s do damage our connections do\nresult in us getting shamed or yelled at\nor or maybe even abused actively or\nmaybe disconnected from as was the case\nfor me so then right in this protective\nstance hiding our shame not wanting to\ntell anyone even you talk about a red\nflag being and this is I think another\ninteresting way shame appears where we\nhide shameful things right now it's\nmaybe not even about us now we're not\ntelling our loved ones or our best\nfriends or our support system about the\ntruth of what's happening in our\nrelationship it might not even be what\nwhat we're doing right we don't want to\nshare even just using your partner right\nthe or my partner the verbal abuse\nthat's happening because then we're\nafraid if we speak this trying to find\nsupport that it will only\nexpose our unworthiness because why it\nmust mean something about us that\nsomeone is treating us this way it must\nmean something about us that I can't\nleave so then why would I tell and so I\nreally appreciate how you kind of offer\none of those habits too that I think for\na lot of us is become so ingrained where\nwe again A lot of times gradually we\nlimit what we tell to other people\nbecause we feel so deeply shameful about\nwhat it means and then before we know it\nright those blinders are even bigger or\neven you know more comprehensively\nencapsulating the entirety of our\nexperience and then at the same time\nwe're cutting oursel off from a\ndifferent perspective from support and\nsome of us are becoming then more and\nmore isolated right in these toxic\nCycles only continuing to validate our\nown\nshame and now add the thing that we were\ntalking about earlier about identity\nbecause if you identify as let's say a\nstrong woman or a Confident Woman and\nyou've got all these things the guilt\nthe shame anything behind the scenes you\ngo well I can't expose expose right\nquote unquote I can't expose this\nbecause now I won't be seen as a\nConfident Woman I won't be seen as\nFillin the blank and so again that\nidentity can actually hold us back from\nspeaking the shame and then the shame\nactually then holds us back from making\nany change at all yes and so the cycle\ngoes and then sometimes even as you talk\nabout trust right bleeds into other\nrelationships right because we begin to\ndoubt trusting in general right why\ntrust at all and I love how beautifully\nyou even talk about trust right trust\nisn't necessarily a good or bad thing I\nmean I can make a case that trust is a\nnecessary thing right in a relationship\nthough the question is right who are we\ngiving our trust to but then all of this\nbads together right continuing to\ncontribute to our insecurity and our\nbelief that we can't maybe trust anyone\nso we stay with the one person or we\nstay alone or whatever it is and then\nthis whole kind of cycle so with all of\nthis said can you talk to us a little\nbit about how it was for you to you know\nor what point it was if it was a point\nor again another kind of gradual\nrealization what allowed you ultimately\nto to leave the relationship or kind of\nwhat was that process of coming to this\nawareness that leaving would be then the\nchoice that would be ultimately best for\nyou yeah I think a big key was when I\nmet him I was just in high school and\nthen as we were together I went to\ncollege and so actually seeing different\nDynamics see meeting new people meeting\nnew couples meeting different people\nthat think in different ways you start\nto see what other how other people live\nand you're like huh\ninteresting it says this to me but look\nat that couple over there there's\nsomething that's not you know making\nsense here and so you start to identify\nthese things that like huh maybe I\nshould start looking at that and it\nstarts it's the questioning right it\nbecomes the\nCuriosity of what else is out there and\none of the stories that I share in the\nbook that was really hard for me to\nshare actually because it's so\nembarrassing going back to the shame and\nthe embarrassment of it um I was like I\nhave to share this story because this is\na perfect example of how we get trapped\nagain in the shame and not recognizing\nthat no this is not normal um you okay\nif I share the story yes please so um\nit's in the chapter in the book but um\nit's I'm at college and I'm on the phone\nto my boyfriend and so he was um he\ndidn't go to college he was a delivery\nboy for Domino's Pizza but to be honest\nthat was actually just a um you know a\nscapegoat he was actually a drug dealer\nso just to give the context of I was\ngoing to college I wanted to make movies\nI wanted to you know win an Academy\nAwards in film making and his life was\nvery different to mine I didn't care\nabout the money or anything like that\nbut those were our different lives so I\nwould Trav\nhome to see him a couple of hours every\nevery weekend so there's one day I'm on\nthe phone to him in my dorm room and my\nfriend walks in and she walks in with a\nguy and so I mean you know' got a dorm\nroom full of six other women so there's\nalways going to be voices and he starts\nto go oh who's\nthat in that moment you just know uh oh\nthat one question that seems on the\nsurface to be very innocent immediately\nI rush to he's jealous he's getting\ntriggered oh my God he's threatened how\ndo I distinguish this as quickly and\nhumanly uh as quickly as possible and so\nimmediately I just Tred to oh don't\nworry it's just my friend's boyfriend\ndon't worry right and then change the\nsubject thinking that I had managed that\nright so going back to I make myself\nsmaller I now manage him which how many\nof us do that so I'm now managing him\nand I think at the end of the\nconversation okay great he's he's\nforgotten about it yeah yeah yeah oh\nclose call so I go back to my room I go\nback to like watching TV or whatever I\nwas doing and then I hear a knock on my\ndoor and I open it and this is a few\nhours later he's standing there and in\nthat moment I've seen all the movies\nI've seen you know um what's his name um\nTom crw show up and be like you know you\nhad me a hello you're the one like I've\nseen those dramatic moments so I open\nthe door thinking this is a moment where\nhe's going to be dramatic oh my God I\nlove you and he just walks right by me\nand he starts looking under my bed\nlooking in the closet going into my\nbathroom going into my dirty underwear\nlike basket to find some proof that I\nwas cheating on him now he pulls out a\npiece of my dirty underwear and he's\nlike see this is proof this is\nSeaman now it's even hard for me to say\nthis story out loud but I need to\nbecause those are the moments where\ninstead of going this guy's lost his nut\nhe's clearly jealous and very in secure\nhe's now throwing blame at me he's now\ntrying to make me shameful of my bodily\nfunctions because it wasn't Sean um he's\ntrying to make me you know like guilty\nand shameful over that instead of\nactually seeing for it for what it was\nyou know what I did I thought that was\nlove I thought he must love me to drive\nall the way here and care if I was with\nsomebody\nelse and that idea at the time where I\nsaid it was love over time as I start to\nevolve more and more I'm in college I'm\nmeeting new people I start to go is that\nnormal should a guy really react like\nthat if they're jealous why were they\njealous what have they done to make them\njealous and it goes back to the\nCuriosity once you start being curious\ninstead of just accepting the behavior\nonce you get curious about the behavior\nthose flags start to become very very\nclear and over time as those flags\nbecome clear I just started to ask\nmyself is this what I want for the rest\nof my life like now that you see the\nflags there's no right or wrong no one\nshould dictate the life that you lead\nbut do you actually knowing the flags\nnow now that you've identified them do\nyou want this to be your life in 5 years\nin 10 years in 20 years when you're on\nyour deathbed is this the person knowing\nwhat they're like to be holding your\nhand as you take your last breath I\nactually think about that and the truth\nwas if I had stayed with him once I\nstarted to be curious and realized I\nthought oh he's never going to support\nmy dreams he's never going to accept the\nfact that I have this drive to go to\nAmerica he's always going to try and\nhold me back and he's going to the\njealousy will only escalate it will\nnever minimize and so once I was really\nhonest about what that next 5 years\nlooked like and I asked myself do you\nwant this yes or no make it freaking\nbinary and once I made it binary and\nonce I said no that's when I started to\nmake the adjustments to build my\nconfidence in order for me to\nleave I think that's what you're\ndescribing again is when we have\nexposure right kind of taking these\nblinders just get a little widen right\nyou're going to college you see other\nrelationships and again we get exposed\nto different perspectives or experiences\nin different ways at different timelines\nbut that's kind of to give line is what\nwe're talking about right now I I don't\nhave just what I know right I have what\nI'm seeing right in someone else and for\na lot of us that then helps us kind of\nlook at ourselves and our own\ncircumstances our own Dynamics a little\nmore honestly and the honesty too that\nyou're kind of describing when you say\nthe jealousy right will only get worse\nbecause I think some of us can tort or\nhave this idea that that's not the case\nthat if only like you're saying if only\nI manage if only I tend if only I change\nin this way and maybe even directly\nwe're hearing the changes that we have\nto make for the jealousy to go away but\nagain I think that becomes such a a\nproblematic toxic Dynamic where there is\nthis belief that if I just stop or em a\nlittle more or listen to them in this\nway right we kind of modify whether it's\nourselves or our circumstances in an\nattempt to make the jealousy go away\nthough for the large majority of the\nscenarios to speak to your very wise\npoint it doesn't we just end up\ncontorting and contorting and there's\nalways something else because in reality\nagain when we're talking about jealousy\nwhat we're talking about is what you\nbegan with which is insecurity and\ninsecurity is in ourselves so no matter\nof contorting for most will resolve or\nabsolve the insecurity that's causing\nthe jealous Behavior so I I just so\nappreciate you kind of giving that\nlanguage because I think that's a really\nhard reality and a lot of us are\nexhausting oursel endlessly on the\nbelief of otherwise that if only or that\nthere is something to do that will\nrelieve these jealous actions toxic\neven yeah and I contorted myself so much\nI mean even to that moment where I\ncontorted myself to being like it's okay\nlike no I'm not cheating on you like\nwhat are you know like me trying to\nalmost get him to calm down by\napologizing what was apologizing for\nNicole like seriously what was I\napologizing for but I still found myself\ndoing it and the truth is as I started\nto see as I love the idea of the\nblinders widening slowly slowly as the\nblinders are widening slowly slowly and\nI recognized oh maybe that wasn't love\nmaybe that was insecurity maybe that was\njealousy I had to come to terms with it\nI had to own it that I had contorted\nmyself so that I could have the courage\nto leave because going back to that\nshame piece that we were talking about\nif I keep keeping it if I keep it in the\nshame box and and it never see the light\nof day I can never acknowledge it I can\nthen never say if this shows up again I\nknow it for what it is if you put it in\nthe shame box you've forgotten about it\nyou're trying to ignore it but I wanted\nto make sure that I would never get\nthere again in any new relationship and\nso that was part of why even though I\nstill feel uncomfortable talking about\nit I must because I understand that the\nmore comfortable I get with it the more\num I can identify if and when it ever\nhappened again\nso can you now kind of expanding\nextending the timeline a bit forward\nafter courageously right making the\nchoice to leave and then ultimately\nleaving right the relationship ending um\ncan you say a little bit about kind of\nthe Fallout if you will or the what I\nwould call because you you mentioned\ngrief and mourning and I think the\nreality for a lot of us that even within\ntoxic relationships it's still a loss\nright a dynamic has changed a person is\nno longer present in the way that they\nonce were even if there is toxic\npatterning and then ultimately too kind\nof interested in if and how the Fallout\nagain or the impact of this relationship\nor how this relationship then impacted\nyou moving forward into future\nrelationships because again I think that\nfor a lot of us right there is something\nwe then carry in terms of when now\npresent it with the possibility of\nsomeone\nnew yeah absolutely and the thing that I\nwant to make sure that is so true that I\nhave to keep hammering home there were a\nbeautiful moments in that relationship\nand that's why I ended up staying and so\nthe grief part is it's easy to say they\nwere a toxic person they were bad right\nit's easier to do that because now you\ncan like try and let go it's like see\nI'm I'm done with him but the truth was\nthere were beautiful and magic moments\nand so in order for me to be able to\nmove on I found it important to actually\ngrieve the beautiful side of the\nrelationship and the the stuff that was\nfun the stuff that was bringing you know\nlight and you know joy to my life\nbecause I realized it was keeping me\nstuck so I had to acknowledge it I had\nto grieve that those are moments that\nI'll never get back with him in order\nfor me to be able to then move on and\nyou know like the death of things there\nis that process and I'm I'm not sure if\nyou actually know the process of your\nhand if you don't mind actually laying\nit out but I'm so aware that there's a\nprocess right it's like the sadness the\nanger the if you don't mind actually\nexplaining but go through it just say\nright now I'm mourning the death of a\npart of a relationship that felt\ngreat do the process go through that M\nso that you can then start again build\nyour confidence back up before you then\nmove on to another relationship but yeah\nI'd love to know like that process that\npeople can really hear it you know I\nthink when we think about grieving and\nthere's a multi-stage process um I don't\nknow the exact though when I think about\ngrieving I'm always hesitant too to give\nkind of like these are the exact\nemotions because I do believe grief\nlooks different some of us might right\njust feel the loss the sadness the\nloneliness some of us I think very\nnaturally then move into the anger of\nall of the unmet needs or all the\nviolations right of boundaries and\nlimits that had happened in that\nrelationship ship so I think when we\nthought when I think about any sort of\nemotional process grief in particular\ninclude it right I think of just about\nlearning for a lot of us a new skill of\nhow to be present without judgment to\nwhatever emotion arises and for a lot of\nus it's Cycles right we we feel\ndifferent ways in different moments for\nsome of us certain emotions in terms of\nour mourning or our grieving period\nlasts longer than others so I'm always\nhesitant in terms of timelines because\nmy fear is outsourcing kind of like what\nwe're talking about here right someone\nreading a timeline of grief and if their\nprocess isn't going exactly along in\nterms of what they're feeling or how\nlong they're feeling it then this is\nanother moment for us to judge that\nwe're not living up to what everyone\nelse is doing or maybe we're not\ngrieving right or appropriately and\nmaybe it'll never go away and so though\ngrief and what you're you know\nbeautifully wisely sharing here and\nbeing with it and not just denying in\nthe beauty the reason the parts of the\nrelationship that we did see value in at\none time the bond that we did create the\nlife even for some of us I mean grief\ncan look very practical too not just\nemotional right lives are that maybe\nonce we're in embedded or entwined\nliving together right things now change\nand so grieving and I really appreciate\nit not only in the book but now as\nyou're kind of going into that space\nbecause if we don't whatever our grief\ntimeline is our process or whatever\nfeelings are present if we don't be if\nwe're not present to them it doesn't\nmean that they're not there right and\nthen for a lot of us I think that\ncontinues to contribute to the shame and\neven maybe what we then carry with us as\nwe look forward into other\nrelationships yeah God you so right\nabout the grief thing that is 100% right\nbecause we end up judging ourselves that\nwe're not on the same timeline as\neveryone so I love that you pushed back\nand said that um and as you were\nactually talking what I realized was I\nneeded to grieve because I was in this\npattern so he would do something that\nwas very mean abusive I would get very\nsad I would cry then the crying after I\ncried enough I then got angry I can't\nbelieve he did this right now it's like\nthe anger that's almost making me feel\npowerful cuz I went from powerless the\nsadness the Brokenness to then trying to\nrepair myself gaining the power but that\nthat meant getting angry so then I would\nget angry at him and then over time that\nanger would dissipate and as the anger\ndissipated I started to remember the\ngood things forgot the bad things and\nthen started to yearn for the happy\nthings again and that is where then it\nbrought me back into that relationship\nso that was my personal cycle that I\nstarted to recognize and so the grief\nallowed me to let go and embrace that I\nwill no longer have that good stuff so\nthat when I eventually got there I\nwouldn't then repeat the cycle it was\nlike instead of going around you know a\nroundabout in England instead of keep\ngoing it's like oh I've actually just\nseen the exit ramp and so the grief\nallows me to exit that cycle of uh you\nknow getting angry going back to him\nfighting love you know love bombing\ngreat sex I'm going to be honest right\ngreat sex then back again the fiery\narguments that actually just would make\nme feel alive that's another thing I had\nto grieve is that how do I feel alive\nagain oh that is an unhealthy way to\nfeel alive cool I have to grieve that\nfeeling so that I can actually adopt and\ncultivate a much healthier way to have a\nrelationship and that's where the space\nbetween you not jumping into another\nrelationship making sure that you start\nto validate yourself you start to change\nyour identity you find ways to elevate\nyourself and that you find ways to write\nout your morals going back to something\nwe'd said earlier write out your values\nand make sure that you've got boundaries\nso that when you meet that new person\nyou've already built a New Foundation\nthat that relationship house can be\nbuilt\non I'm ready to just throw the mic and\nbe done here on that note in all\nseriousness Lisa I mean that was just\nsuch a beautiful kind of wrap because\nthe reality of it is we do we go back to\nthe same person we carry same habits\nwith us until we take the moment right\nto to reorganize to reboot to really\nlook at ourself and get really grounded\nin terms of these commitments to to\nrebuild for a lot of us our own trust in\noursel back our own respect for ourself\nand then our ability to very\ncourageously and vulnerably put oursel\nout there again with the possibility of\nnot knowing what will happen though say\nyou know keeping committed to the\nintention to do our part right in\ncreating a new less toxic more\nfunctional more connective more\nauthentic Dynamic so thank you thank you\nthank you always for not only gifting us\nwith your book in and of itself
