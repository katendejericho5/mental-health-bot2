    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about how to\nbegin to respond instead of reacting\nlearning how to shift from reaction mode\nto response mode is probably one of the\nmost important and impactful tools that\ncan quite literally change your life\nbecause the reality of it is most of us\nwalk around immediately reacting to the\nthings that happen to us and instead of\nimmediately reacting to the world around\nus we can actually teach ourselves how\nto respond to it allowing us to make\nmore conscious choices into how we\nnavigate the world around us so that we\ncan feel proud and good about ourselves\nthis practice really does Boost our\nconfidence because we'll end up feeling\nmore in control of oursel and our\nemotions but before I teach you how\nlet's first talk about the difference\nbetween a response and a reaction\nstarting with a reaction a reaction is\nan immediate knee-jerk and often\nhabitual way of interacting it comes\nfrom our unconscious mind and what it\nlooks like really simply is a thing\nhappens in the world I feel some kind of\nway whether it's upset sad angry and\nnear immediately I do some kind of thing\nand the more we begin to observe oursel\nin these reactive moments the more we'll\nsee how patterned our reactions are even\nhow autopilot these reactions can be\nmeaning they seemingly happen out of our\ncontrol a lot of people call this\nprogramming and it's really just the\nconditioned ways or or the ways that we\nlearned to react to our emotions since\nwe were young so now let's talk about\nwhat a response is our response is a\nmore conscious often more objective way\nof interacting when we stop living in\nthat autopilot we can begin to make\nchoices outside of those immediate\nemotional reactions so using that\nexample something happens say what\nhappens is someone says something to us\nthat upsets or activates us triggers us\nand I know for me in those moments I can\nfind myself near immediately saying\nsomething mean or snarky right back to\nthe person only to afterward feel guilty\nfeel shameful even wondering why the\nheck did I say that and I end up feeling\nshameful as I imagine many of you do\nbecause in those moments we might not\nhave had the intention to say or do the\nthing that we ended up doing or saying\nand it feels like it just sort have\nhappened so now our response in that\nmoment might look like I might still\nfeel some kind of way about the comment\nthat was said to me whatever it might\nhave been but I might choose a different\nresponse in that moment instead of\nsaying something that I might feel bad\nabout later I might take a few deep\nbreaths or I might word what I'm saying\nin a way that doesn't land in such a\nmean manner now I want to point out of\ncourse these Pathways these emotional\nreactions that we're talking about\nthey've been paved through years and\nyears and years and years of repeated\nBehavior really simply what this means\nis we've practiced these reactive habits\nmost of the time outside of our\nawareness over and over and over again\nmaking learning a new response difficult\nin the beginning it will take time and\nit will take work and likely you will\nfall into those old reactive habits and\nall of that is okay even small moments\nwhere you notice that you're able to\nrespond instead of react are a huge win\nso as you begin these next steps that\nI'm going to go through in just a minute\nI want you to note those moments and\nmake it a point to celebrate each and\nevery time you're able to shift from\nreactivity to responsiveness because\nit's a big deal and there is so much\npower that comes in choosing how we can\nrespond to the world around us so here's\nhow you begin that process right now the\nfirst step in how to begin responding\nand breaking that habit of reacting\nmight sound really simple and that step\nis to pause\nit's as easy as that but of course it's\nmuch easier said than done we live in a\nsociety where everything is at near\nlight speed we're almost 247 available\nin contact with whoever it is that we\nwant to contact and this makes pausing\nfor a lot of us really difficult but\nwhen we learn to pause what we're doing\nis we're breaking that immediate\nreaction and we're giving oursel just a\nmoment a bit of space to maybe actually\nthink about what's going on to maybe\nreflect how we feel to maybe allow some\nof the stronger emotions to pass before\nwe even make a choice about how we want\nto respond time itself and allowing our\nbody to naturally\ndownregulate and our emotions to turn\nthe volume down on those emotional\nexperiences really does allow us to\nbegin to see the bigger picture of\nwhat's happening in that moment so the\nfirst step again is to pause before we\nhave that immediate\nreaction the second step is to begin to\npractice what is called objective\nobservation so once we're paused what\nwe're going to do now is we're going to\nbegin to separate what's happening from\nour story about what's happening and\nthis will allow us to objectively begin\nto see our circumstances a bit clearer\nbecause most of the time what we're\nreacting to is the story that we've told\nourselves not the event itself\nso really common example of this could\nlook like say we're developing a\nrelationship someone whether it's a\nfriendship or perhaps a romantic\npartnership and say we're texting with\nthem and for whatever reason we don't\nget a text back for a few hours of time\nand in those hours we start to notice\nourself getting annoyed we start to\ncreate stories maybe we're telling\noursel oh this person might not be\ninterested in a relationship with us\nlike we thought or like we want and\nbefore we know it before too long most\nof us end up reacting to that story that\nwe've created of course we end up being\nupset if we're now thinking that the\nperson that we're interested in isn't\ninterested in us so now to use objective\nobservation in this moment what that\nwill look like is acknowledging what's\nhappening in the moment you might even\nsay to yourself okay I haven't gotten\nthe text back in a little while maybe in\nthree hours whatever the time frame is\nobjectively that is what has happened in\nthese moments we can even practice or\nthinking about it like looking at\nourselves from above like we're hovering\nwatching oursel from overhead beginning\nto notice what is it that I'm thinking\nin this moment what is it that I'm\nfeeling in my body in this moment doing\nthis objectively observing oursel from\nthis distance or from a different\nperspective for a lot of us can help us\nstart to pull oursel out of that\nreactive spiral and over time we'll\nstart to notice that we'll even begin to\nassign less and less of those meanings\nto what happens to us at all and we'll\nbe able to create space just to more\nobjectively be with our changing\ncircumstances without all of those\nstories we won't have then the emotions\nor the reaction and we'll be more likely\nto have the space to choose the new\nresponse we're looking for the third\nstep is you're going to then practice or\nshift your focus I should say on to your\nbreath our breath is an intentional way\nwe can begin to regulate our body when\nwe're in that reactive State our body is\nactually in figh ORF flight mode our\nbreathing gets fast and our mind starts\nto rise and usually all of that's\nhappening outside of our awareness\nmeaning we're not even noticing that\nit's happening as we begin to notice\nwhat's happening in our body in those\nreactive moments as we become more aware\nof those Sensations we can begin then to\nintentionally use our breath to calm our\nbody and this can be as simple as\nslowing and deepening our breath I like\nto even just put a hand on my belly\nwhile I'm doing that to remind myself to\nbreathe in and out from that deeper\nspace of my belly and doing that does\ntwo things the first thing that slowing\nand deepening our breath does is it\nsignals to our body that we're safe and\nthat we can relax it'll calm those\nreactions in our body and the second\nthing that focusing on our breath will\ndo is it will give us a place to focus\nour attention right not on those stories\nthat will continue that emotional\nreaction and then likely that habitual\nreaction but we can shift our Focus now\nfrom those stories that will likely\nstill be there in the beginning and\nbegin to pay attention to our slow deep\nbreath which is also at the same time\ncalming our body and giving us more more\nof a chance of remaining\nresponsive and now the fourth step in my\nopinion is the most important step and\nthis step is to forgive yourself each\nand every time when you do react because\nthe reality of it is those reactions are\nwired into us and we're human and we've\npracticed these reactions for many of us\noutside of our awareness for our\nlifetime I still find myself in these\nemotional reactive moments even as I've\nbeen practicing them no one\nalive is without these emotional\nreactions they are just part of our\nlived experience learned in our\nchildhood and then repeat it outside of\nour awareness so I'm sharing this\nhopefully to normalize for all of you\nlistening and to throw away any\nexpectation that you might have in\nlistening that this information will\nsomehow immediately remove these\nreactions from your neurobiology and\nagain I'm using those words\nintentionally because they are ired into\nyou into your mind and into your body\nwhich is why they won't immediately go\naway which is why acknowledging that all\nof these steps and shifting from\nreactions to responsiveness is a process\nso I hope and suggest all of you to\nremove any expectation of perfection and\nto begin to practice this step forgiving\nyourself each and every time with\ncompassion and with grace that you do\nnotice one of those old habitual\nreactions because they probably are\ngoing to stay around for a bit of time\nuntil you practice shifting more\nregularly into this responsive space and\nI do want you to give yourself a chance\nto practice and to just notice as things\nshift and change when you begin these\nfour steps noticing how you feel when\nyou react versus when you respond and\nhow good it feels as you notice yourself\nbecoming more calm more grounded in\nthose emot moments and more able to\nrespond in the way that you want to or\nthat you choose to and I'd love to hear\nfrom you listening if you've been\npracticing shifting from reactivity to\nresponsiveness I'd love to hear what\nyou're noticing in your mind in your\nbody and in your experiences as you're\nmaking this foundationally powerful\nshift leave it in the comments below"
