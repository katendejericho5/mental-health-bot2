    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about ego work\nfirst I'll explain what the ego is then\nwe'll talk about what ego work is and\nthen finally how to get started so first\nof all we all have an ego well what is\nan ego an ego is a part of our\nself-identity that's been internalized\nbased on our very real lived experiences\nbeginning in childhood so really simply\nit's this identity that we create based\non all of the different meanings that\nwe've assigned to all of the different\nevents that we've experienced so for\nexample say when we were a kid we found\nsomething that really lit us up that we\nloved that we were super interested in\nthat we were super excited about maybe\nit was Art maybe it was moving our body\nin a certain way or dancing and maybe\nfor instance we were in the presence of\nan adult who might have said something\nlike oh calm down don't be so dramatic\nstop moving around in that way\nunderstandably we probably felt hurt and\nat the same time we probably felt like\nour interest our curiosity our\nexcitement is something to be ashamed of\nor to be repressed to be hidden to be\nheld inside so what do we do because\nwe're so incredibly adaptive we\nimmediately begin to learn that that\nbehavior isn't rewarded it doesn't get\nus the feelings of connection of\nbelonging that we want and that we need\nso over time we adapt we begin to show\nless and less of that interest of that\nexcitement of that emotion of that\nself-expression we withhold ourselves in\nsome way in order to avoid being hurt\nnow of course the opposite can happen as\nwell say for instance we have a parent\nwho value something about us maybe it's\nour athletic ability our academic\nability but maybe we're really not that\ninto the thing that they value we're not\ninto sports we're not into whatever is\nimportant to them but at the same time\nwe know that our parent gives us\nattention gives us validation might even\ngive us affection when we're doing the\nthing that they want us to do so\nnaturally we end up putting more effort\ninto that thing even though it doesn't\nlight us up we don't care about it it's\nnot our interest this was so much a part\nof my own journey I saw so early on in\nmy family with my mom in particular who\nwas generally really emotionally shut\ndown except when I was achieving whether\nit was academically or athletically so\nto see and to have that presence of my\nmom that I desperately wanted when I was\nachieving over time what did I do I kept\nachieving in the ways that made her\nproud that allowed her to validate me\nand that allowed us to have those\nconnected moments even if over time I\ncame to realize that the things that my\nmom was interested in and valued weren't\nreally the things that I valued myself\nyet I kept pushing myself to achieve why\nbecause I like all of you listening we\nwill continue to adapt we will continue\nto develop and create this ego identity\nover time as a way of protecting oursel\nbecause we don't want to go back and\nfeel that same hurt so we keep all of\nthose aspects of ourselves suppressed we\nkeep living as this assumed identity so\nthat we can keep oursel protected so\nwhat ego work really is is the practice\nof separating ourself from our ego so we\ncan consciously witness all of the\nhabitual reactive patterns that our ego\ntypically drives us into so that we can\nbegin to create space for more\nauthentically aligned choices so here\nare the steps to begin ego work the\nfirst step you want to name your ego by\ngiving our ego a name we're already\nbeginning that practice of separating\nfrom our ego so that we can begin to not\nonly witness but to understand our\ncondition reactions and all of those\nhabitual behaviors that we've grown to\nknow as us or as our identity this will\ncreate this separation will create the\npossibility or the opportunity for us to\ncreate new responses\nthe Second Step once we give our ego a\nname we want to begin to witness the\ndifferent often repeated stories that\nour ego tells us now of course they're\ngoing to be different for each of us\nthough really commonly at our core so\nmany of us struggle or have a deep ego\nbelief that we're not enough or that\nwe're not worthy or that some aspects of\nour self-expression make us not enough\nor make us not worthy by beginning to\nseparate and view that story or\nwitnessing that story we can see then\nall of the chain reactions that happens\nif and when we believe the story as we\nhave for so long which brings us to that\nthird step we want to witness\nconsciously then what happens what\nreactions we have when we believe our\nego story to be true so when I believe\nwhatever story my ego is telling me how\nis it that I react many of us start to\ncompare ourselves immediately to other\npeople or maybe we become really\ncritical perfectionistic about ourselves\nintolerant of imperfection maybe we\nengage in a negative self- soothing\npattern something that's not really\nadaptive like overeating over exercising\nusing substances maybe shopping too much\nto numb the pain\noverspending just witnessing this\npattern without judgment will shift us\nfrom being the reaction itself to being\nthe Observer of the reaction itself so\nnow we know we have an ego with this\ncreated assumed identity we can give\nthem a name to separate oursel we can\nbegin to view the story in our mind that\nour ego is telling us that then leads us\nright in to this chain of Habitual\nreactions bringing us to the fourth step\nand most empowering step in my opinion\nof ego work which is releasing the story\nnoticing that when we release the story\nwe give oursel an opportunity to make a\nnew choice if we release that we're not\ngood enough or that we're not worthy\nenough in this way might I be able to\nshow up for the support that I really\nneed might I be able to express myself\nin the way that I really want to might I\nbe able to make a choice to speak and\nact from a more authentic place it might\nbe really helpful for some of you to\nwrite these prompts down for the future\nthey are my ego's name is\nblank my ego is telling me the story\nthat\nblank when I believe this story I react\nby blank and finally when I release this\nstory I can make a choice to blank now\nremember ego work shifting our\nrelationship with our ego is not going\nto happen overnight we've all had an ego\nand an identity that we've been\nstrengthening for years decades maybe\neven our\nlifetime when we begin the practice of\nego work of separating and observing\nthese habitual patterns we give oursel\nthe opportunity to finally sometimes for\nthe first time in our life begin to make\nchoices that are more authentically\ndriven based on who we actually are"
