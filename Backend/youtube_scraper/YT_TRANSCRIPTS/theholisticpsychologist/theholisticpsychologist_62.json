    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about the mother\nwound the mother wound is the pain\nthat's passed down from our mothers\ngenerationally and of course our mothers\nwere impacted by many different factors\nincluding their relationship with their\nown mother including societal\nexpectations patriarchal conditioning\nand of course entertainment and media\nour mothers literally shape us they mold\nus beginning in the womb which is our\nfirst environment and our relationship\nwith our mother is the the first and the\nmost important relationship that we will\never have we now know through attachment\nTheory that's been verified in research\nthat even our sense of self is developed\nthrough the relationship we have with\nour mother now some of us and actually\nthe large majority of us were born to\nmothers that went through their own\ntrauma based on their own childhoods\ncausing them to pass on to us\nsubconscious beliefs and behaviors that\nwe then repeat and pass on to our future\nGenerations so what are some ways that\nwe get the mother wounded one way is we\nhad a mother who met our physical needs\nlike food or shelter but they didn't\nmeet our emotional needs maybe you were\nleft alone after the family had\narguments or maybe you felt like you\ncouldn't really go to your mom when you\nhad an issue because she'd freak out or\nmaybe generally you just felt a distance\nand you didn't get that nurturing safe\ncloseness when we don't get our\nemotional needs met we create or develop\nthe mother wound another factor that\ncreates the mother wound is having a\nmother that didn't allow negative\nemotions if you were always punished say\nfor being angry or maybe you were told\nto stop crying or stop being dramatic\nanytime you were sad or upset those\nmessages teach us that emotions\nespecially these upsetting negative ones\nare actually something to be ashamed of\nso then we begin our own pattern of\nrepressing or suppressing essentially\ndisconnecting oursel from those emotions\nbecause without a parent who can help us\nunderstand accept and navigate our\nemotions we end up feeling overwhelmed\nor completely confused by how we're\nfeeling at all another experience that\ncauses the mother wound is having a\nmother that has body image issues now\nthis can manifest in many different ways\nwe can hear mom being critical of her\nown self her own body its size its shape\nit's appearance or maybe critical of\nyour body maybe she comments all the\ntime on the food you eat or she eats\nmaybe even putting you on a diet at a\nyoung age all of these actions send us\nmessages that our body is something to\nfeel shameful of and can even lead to\ndysfunctional relationships with food or\nour body ourselves another experience\nthat creates the mother wound is having\na mother who's highly critical this is\nsomeone who only points out the negative\nand when only the negative is pointed\nout this leads to low feelings of\nselfworth and a lot of times\nperfectionism or this drive to present\noursel in a particular way to hide all\nof our personal flaws because if you\nbelieve that the only way to get love is\nif your mom approves of it then you're\ngoing to act in a way that Mom approves\nof and a lot of times that might not be\nnecessarily true to who you actually\nare another factor that creates the\nmother wound is having a mother who was\nunder resourced and now this can be a\nmother who didn't have enough financial\nresources or maybe emotional support to\ntruly be there for her children now a\nreally common example that I know a lot\nof you experien was having a single mom\nwho had to work around the clock to\nsupport the family financially when\nmothers are in survival mode like that\nthey are only able to focus on the\nimmediate problem at hand which a lot of\ntimes means that they're not able to be\nthere emotionally for their children\nbecause all of the weight of daily\nsurvival quite literally is falling on\nthem so without the resources they're\nunable to show up emotionally for their\nchildren and a final experience that\ncreates the mother wound is having a\nmother who is cold or shut down this\ndissociator disconnected mom is someone\nwho's really detached from reality\nthey're not fully there emotionally and\nsometimes they even give the silent\ntreatment when they're UPS said when a\nmother is cold or shut down emotionally\nwe get the message that they're not\nthere to support us or to comfort us so\nover time we stop going to them some of\nus even learn to stop asking for help\nentirely and we end up adopting a lone\nwolf or a hyper independent way of\nthinking this idea that I can and will\ndo it all myself I very much had a\nmother who was shut down cold and\ndistant not for any ill-intentioned\nreasons because she was stuck in her own\nsurvival mode with health related issues\ntending to care of the family and\ncompletely shut down herself so she\nwasn't able to give me the support that\nI too needed and even listening to these\nexperiences as you can imagine they all\nhave an impact on us the mother wound\nimpacts the way we see ourselves our\nability to trust or distrust people we\ncarry the impact with us through life\nand on this next video I'm going to\nshare with you the different ways the\nmother wound continues to impact us into\nadulthood and also Al share ways to\nbegin to heal the mother wound so if\nyou're not yet subscribed you might want\nto hit subscribe now so that you don't\nmiss that video and I'd love to hear\nfrom you in the comments if you resonate\ndid you have any of these experiences\nyourself I'd love to hear from you drop\nit in the comments below"
