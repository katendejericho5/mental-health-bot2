    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about green\nflags in relationships these are a few\nsigns that the person is healthy to be\nin a relationship with and of course I'm\nnot just talking about our romantic\nrelationships or our intimate\nrelationships I'm talking about\nrelationships with our friends and with\nour family we so frequently talk about\nred flags or warning signs so today I'm\ngoing to share some concrete signs that\nthe person is actually safe and\ntrustworthy to build a relationship\nbefore I go into these signs\nI want to acknowledge no one is perfect\nall humans have flaws so we can't expect\neveryone to have all of these traits all\nthe time what I want you to think about\nis does the person show up in these ways\nmore often than not so say around 60 or\n70% of the time you might even think\nabout some of the people that you're in\nrelationship with when I go through\nthese signs and see if you see these\nalready ready in your relationship the\nfirst sign is transparency or really\nsimply openness this is someone who\nshares their perspective their emotions\ntheir intentions they don't hide their\nactions they're not defensive they're\nnot secretive and they don't shut down\nto certain topics they're also not\noversharing they're an open book in\nareas that are important and now I know\na lot of you know what it feels like to\nhave that gut feeling when we know\nsomeone's lying to us or they're hiding\nsomething on the other hand when someone\nis transparent or open we feel the\nopposite we feel safe we feel like we\ndon't have to be on guard the second\nsign is\nconsideration simply the ability to take\nothers thoughts and emotions or their\nperspective into account when we share\nthings with this person we feel like\nwe're really being listened to and that\nthey're interested in our perspective or\nin our experience of things when someone\nconsiders us we know that we matter to\nthem that they value us in their life\nthey're taking us into consideration the\nthird sign is their actions match their\nwords more importantly even their values\nanother word for this is really simply\nintegrity and now I know all of us have\nbeen around someone who says one thing\nand does another thing the more\nconsistently this happens if this\nhappens over and over and over again we\nend up we feel unsafe we might even feel\nuncomfortable around this person and\nthat's understandable because when\npeople aren't predictable or aren't\nconsistent it's really hard to trust\nthem on the other hand when people's\nwords match their actions or simply when\nthey do what they say and when we know\nthat they're acting in ways that align\nwith their values maybe even our values\nwe're able to feel safer and secure with\nthem the fourth sign is flexibility this\nis someone who has a willingness to\ncompromise it doesn't doesn't always\nhave to be their way a rigid or\ninflexible person is someone who\ntypically has a high need to control\ncontrol the environment control other\npeople and this often comes out as them\nbeing really opinionated or maybe giving\nunsolicited advice even being judgmental\nor critical on the other hand when\nsomeone is flexible they can have more\nempathy for you because they're not\ntrying to control you they're able to\naccept how you are maybe even understand\nhow you are that's a real really good\nfeeling the fifth sign is they respect\nyour boundaries or your limits they're\nable to hear try to understand and\nultimately most importantly they're able\nto accept another person's boundaries or\nlimits so for example say you share with\nsomeone that you feel uncomfortable or\nmaybe unsafe based on something that\nthey've said or that they've done and\nthey listen they try to understand your\ndiscomfort and they honor your request\nor your limit instead of saying\nsomething like oh it's not a big deal or\nmaybe changing the subject or Worse\nlaughing at the\nsituation when someone hears us and\naccepts our limits as they are without\nquestioning them without trying to talk\nus out of them or without ignoring them\nall together it creates the foundation\nfor trust and Security in the\nrelationship the sixth sign is they\ndon't try to oneup you one-upping is\nbeing in competition with trying to win\nand this could look as simple as you\nshare with someone that maybe you say I\ndidn't have a good day and you\nimmediately hear back well my day was\nworse let me tell you about it or maybe\nyou're celebrating an accomplishment\nyou're saying something that you're\nexcited about and the person immediately\nbrings it back to something that they've\ndone when someone can't hold space for\nwhat we're sharing with them and brings\nthe conversation back to themselves or\ncelebrates themselves in some way it\nmakes us feel really invalidated\nsometimes even shut down when someone\ndoesn't want up us feels like they're\nlistening to us feels like they're\nsupporting us whether it's in our bad\nmood or in our celebration support is so\nimportant in\nrelationships so all of these are green\nflags when you find people who have\nthese traits you want to invest in these\nrelationships most importantly you want\nto start to practice these traits\ncultivate these aspects of yourself\nbecause the more you embody these green\nflags the more you'll attract people who\nalso have them giving you the\nopportunity to create safer and more\nsecure relationships now I want to hear\nfrom you what is your most important\ngreen flag leave it in the comments\nbelow"
