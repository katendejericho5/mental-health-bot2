    "transcript": "I have complex trauma so I have no\nmemories of my childhood it's probably\nfor the best if you know what I\nmean I have complex trauma so I easily\nstartle because my nervous system is\nconstantly stuck in a state of fight or\nflight I have complex trauma so I feel\noverwhelmed from the time I wake up to\nthe time I go to bed because no one\ntaught me how to regulate my emotions I\nhave complex trauma so I overe explain\neverything I do in hopes that I won't be\nmisunderstood and punished just like in\nchildhood I have complex trauma so I\ncan't concentrate on anything for too\nlong I usually end up\ndissociating then I forget what I was\ndoing at that time"
