    "transcript": "today I'm going to talk about why we cry\ncrying actually has a neurobiological\npurpose it can help regulate your\nnervous system when we experience\noverwhelming emotions we often cry as a\nway to physiologically bring our body\nback to a parasympathetic or a grounded\nregulated peaceful calm State when we\ncry our body is releasing oxytocin and\nother endorphins these are really simply\nfeel-good chemicals which is why so many\nof us feel calmer and more at peace\nafter a good cry a lot of people think\nthat crying means that we're sad but\ncrying actually means that we're over\nstimulated some of us might cry when we\nfeel angry or maybe frustrated when we\nfeel unheard or really any other emotion\nthat puts our body into fight or flight\nnow of course a lot of us grow up in\nhomes where we are punished or shamed\nfor crying and maybe when we were upset\nwe heard things like stop crying crying\nor I'll give you something to cry about\nor we might have heard it's not a big\ndeal stop being so dramatic and because\nso many of us heard these things growing\nup we might continue to feel shameful or\nuncomfortable whenever we or other\npeople cry around us and some of us\nmight even apologize when we're upset\nand when we're crying it is so important\nto understand crying is an extremely\nnatural release for our bodies so here\nare some helpful things to remind\nyourself that the next time you cry you\ncan remind yourself that it's healthy\nthat it's natural that it's safe and\nokay to let your emotions out you can\nsimply let yourself the next time you\ncry you can also take a break excuse\nyourself if you needed a minute of space\nor of pause if you're getting too\noverwhelmed the next time you cry you\ncan and should avoid apologizing or\nsaying sorry for crying you don't need\nto apologize for a natural human\nresponse and finally the next time you\ncry you can take some deep belly breaths\nmaybe putting a hand on your belly\nfeeling your inhale and your exhale this\nwill help your body get back more\nquickly into that parasympathetic State\nnow here are some things that you can do\nwhen other people cry the first thing is\nyou can try to avoid having a knee-jerk\nreaction and immediately saying\nsomething oh no don't cry I didn't want\nto upset you allowing them to pause so\nthat they themselves can cry another\nthing that you can do is you can try to\navoid going into fixer or suggestion\nmode that point where we immediately try\nto solve the problem give someone advice\ngive them a solution this can be even\nmore overstimulating for the person\nwho's upset and cause them even more\nanxiety just practice breathing and\nbeing there with the other person in\nwhatever the upset that they're\nexperiencing is when someone else is\ncrying even if you feel uncomfortable\nable and maybe believe that you caused\nthem to cry you were the cause of their\nupset you can avoid personalizing it you\ncan avoid the assumption that you made\nsomeone else cry people cry for many\ndifferent reasons it's important to\npractice not taking it personally when\nsomeone is upset around you another\nreally helpful thing you can do when\nsomeone else is crying is to remain calm\nstay a tuned to them this will help them\nfeel safer and more comfortable with you\nallowing them to keep crying if they\nneed to and the final thing if it's\nsomeone that you're close to and feel\ncomfortable with and that you know\nenjoys or is soothed by affection you\ncan give them affection if you're aware\nthat that helps soothe or calm or\nComfort them put a hand on their back\ngrab their hand maybe give them a hug\nresearch actually shows that when\nsomeone cries and they're met with\nsupport even more oxytocin is released\nand this can help create an even deeper\nbonding experience and a deeper\nemotional connection between those two\npeople understanding why we cry can help\nus access and allow our tears it can\nhelp us unlearn the belief that crying\nor tears are something that we have to\nstop or avoid altogether letting\nyourself cry when you feel that natural\nurge and letting other people cry when\nthey have that urge will be so\nconnecting not only for yourself but for\nyour relationship and and your bodies\nwill thank you do you let yourself cry\nand how do you feel when you're around\nother people that cry I'd love to hear\nfrom you in the comments"
